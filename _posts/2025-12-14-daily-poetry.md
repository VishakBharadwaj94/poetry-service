## The New School by Joyce Kilmer

```
(For My Mother)

The halls that were loud with the merry tread of
young and careless feet
Are still with a stillness that is too drear to seem like holiday,
And never a gust of laughter breaks the calm of the dreaming street
Or rises to shake the ivied walls and frighten the doves away.
The dust is on book and on empty desk, and the
tennis-racquet and balls
Lie still in their lonely locker and wait for a game that is never
played,
And over the study and lecture-room and the river and meadow falls
A stern peace, a strange peace, a peace that War has made.
For many a youthful shoulder now is gay with an
epaulet,
And the hand that was deft with a cricket-bat is defter with a sword,
And some of the lads will laugh to-day where the trench is red and
wet,
And some will win on the bloody field the accolade of the Lord.
They have taken their youth and mirth away
from the study and playing-ground
To a new school in an alien land beneath an alien sky;
Out in the smoke and roar of the fight their lessons and games are
found,
And they who were learning how to live are learning how to die.
And after the golden day has come and the war is
at an end,
A slab of bronze on the chapel wall will tell of the noble dead.
And every name on that radiant list will be the name of a friend,
A name that shall through the centuries in grateful prayers be said.
And there will be ghosts in the old school,
brave ghosts with laughing eyes,
On the field with a ghostly cricket-bat, by the stream with a ghostly
rod;
They will touch the hearts of the living with a flame that sanctifies,
A flame that they took with strong young hands
from the altar-fires of God.

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

In terms of form, Joyce Kilmer's poem "The New School" consists of six stanzas, each with varying lengths. The first stanza has six lines, while the remaining stanzas have eight lines each. The poem is written in free verse, as there is no consistent meter or rhyme scheme throughout. This lack of formal structure mirrors the chaotic and unpredictable nature of war, which is a central theme of the poem.

### Themes and Imagery

The central themes of the poem revolve around the impact of war on youth and the loss of innocence. Kilmer contrasts the bustling, lively halls of a school with the silence and stillness that have taken over due to the war. The imagery of dusty books and deserted playing grounds evokes a sense of abandonment and loss. The poem also explores themes of sacrifice, bravery, and remembrance, as seen in the references to the young men who have gone off to fight and the promise of honoring their memory.

### Literary Devices

Kilmer employs various literary devices to convey the themes of the poem. One notable device is personification, as seen in lines like "And never a gust of laughter breaks the calm of the dreaming street," where laughter is given human-like qualities. The use of imagery is also prominent, such as in the description of "ghosts in the old school" playing cricket and fishing, symbolizing the lasting presence of those who have passed away. Additionally, the poem uses symbolism, with the "flame that sanctifies" representing the eternal spirit of the fallen soldiers.

### Historical and Personal Context

Written during World War I, "The New School" reflects the widespread impact of the war on communities and individuals. Kilmer himself served in the war and tragically lost his life in combat, adding a personal dimension to the poem's themes of sacrifice and loss. The poem captures the collective experience of a generation of young men who left behind their education and innocence to fight for their country.

### Deep Reading

At its core, "The New School" is a poignant meditation on the transformation of youth into soldiers and the profound changes that war brings. The contrast between the youthful innocence of the students and the harsh realities of battle highlights the brutal disruption that war inflicts on society. The poem ultimately serves as a tribute to the bravery and sacrifice of those who have gone off to fight, emphasizing the enduring impact of their actions on future generations. Through its vivid imagery and emotive language, Kilmer's poem captures the profound human cost of war and the resilience of the human spirit in the face of adversity.

## To -- by Percy Bysshe Shelley

```
Yet look on me--take not thine eyes away,
Which feed upon the love within mine own,
Which is indeed but the reflected ray
Of thine own beauty from my spirit thrown.
Yet speak to me--thy voice is as the tone
Of my heart's echo, and I think I hear
That thou yet lovest me; yet thou alone
Like one before a mirror, without care
Of aught but thine own features, imaged there;

And yet I wear out life in watching thee;
A toil so sweet at times, and thou indeed
Art kind when I am sick, and pity me...
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme
The poem "To --" by Percy Bysshe Shelley is structured as a Petrarchan sonnet, consisting of fourteen lines divided into an octave (the first eight lines) and a sestet (the final six lines). The rhyme scheme is ABBAABBACDCDCD, typical of this form. The meter is mostly iambic pentameter, with lines like "Yet look on me--take not thine eyes away" following this rhythmic pattern.

### Themes and Imagery
The central themes in this poem revolve around unrequited love, longing, and self-reflection. The speaker implores the addressed person not to look away, as their gaze sustains him and reflects their own beauty back to them. The imagery of mirrors and reflections is prevalent throughout, symbolizing the speaker's dependency on the addressee for validation and affirmation.

### Literary Devices
Shelley employs various literary devices in the poem, including personification ("thy voice is as the tone / Of my heart's echo"), metaphor ("the reflected ray / Of thine own beauty from my spirit thrown"), and allusion to classical mythology through the use of the Petrarchan sonnet form, which was popularized by Petrarch in his love poetry.

### Historical and Personal Context
Shelley was a Romantic poet known for his exploration of intense emotions and the sublime in his works. This poem reflects the Romantic ideals of individualism and emotional expression, as the speaker bares his soul and vulnerabilities to the object of his affection. Shelley's personal life was marked by tumultuous relationships and unrequited love, which may have influenced the themes of longing and devotion in this poem.

### Deep Reading
The poem "To --" delves into the complexities of love and self-perception. The speaker is consumed by their feelings for the addressee, finding solace and purpose in their gaze and voice. However, there is a sense of imbalance in the relationship, with the addressee appearing indifferent and self-absorbed, oblivious to the speaker's inner turmoil. The juxtaposition of the speaker's adoration and the addressee's apparent indifference creates a poignant contrast that underscores the speaker's emotional vulnerability and yearning for reciprocation. Ultimately, the poem captures the bittersweet nature of unrequited love and the enduring power of longing and devotion.

## Merry Autumn by Paul Laurence Dunbar

```
It's all a farce,—these tales they tell
  About the breezes sighing,
And moans astir o'er field and dell,
  Because the year is dying.

Such principles are most absurd,—
  I care not who first taught 'em;
There's nothing known to beast or bird
  To make a solemn autumn.

In solemn times, when grief holds sway
  With countenance distressing,
You'll note the more of black and gray
  Will then be used in dressing.

Now purple tints are all around;
  The sky is blue and mellow;
And e'en the grasses turn the ground
  From modest green to yellow.

The seed burs all with laughter crack
  On featherweed and jimson;
And leaves that should be dressed in black
  Are all decked out in crimson.

A butterfly goes winging by;
  A singing bird comes after;
And Nature, all from earth to sky,
  Is bubbling o'er with laughter.

The ripples wimple on the rills,
  Like sparkling little lasses;
The sunlight runs along the hills,
  And laughs among the grasses.

The earth is just so full of fun
  It really can't contain it;
And streams of mirth so freely run
  The heavens seem to rain it.

Don't talk to me of solemn days
  In autumn's time of splendor,
Because the sun shows fewer rays,
  And these grow slant and slender.

Why, it's the climax of the year,—
  The highest time of living!—
Till naturally its bursting cheer
  Just melts into thanksgiving.
```
