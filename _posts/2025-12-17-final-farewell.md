## Thank You for This Journey

After sharing daily poems and literary analysis, the Daily Poetry Blog has reached the end of its journey. This project has run its course, and it's time to retire it with gratitude for all who have explored the beauty of verse through these pages.

**All existing poems and analyses remain preserved** – 

```
The past, the future, dwelling there, like space, inseparable together.

Now I see the secret of the making of the best persons,
It is to grow in the open air and to eat and sleep with the earth.

Afoot and light-hearted I take to the open road,
Healthy, free, the world before me,
The long brown path before me leading wherever I choose.

Henceforth I ask not good-fortune, I myself am good-fortune,
Henceforth I whimper no more, postpone no more, need nothing,
Done with indoor complaints, libraries, querulous criticisms,
Strong and content I travel the open road.
```

*— Walt Whitman, Song of the Open Road*
