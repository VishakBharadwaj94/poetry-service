## Sonnet 22 - When our two souls stand up erect and strong by Elizabeth Barrett Browning

```
When our two souls stand up erect and strong,
Face to face, silent, drawing nigh and nigher,
Until the lengthening wings break into fire
At either curved point,—what bitter wrong
Can the earth do to us, that we should not long
Be here contented? Think. In mounting higher,
The angels would press on us and aspire
To drop some golden orb of perfect song
Into our deep, dear silence. Let us stay
Rather on earth, Beloved,—where the unfit
Contrarious moods of men recoil away
And isolate pure spirits, and permit
A place to stand and love in for a day,
With darkness and the death-hour rounding it.
```

The poem explores the idea of a deep, soulful connection that transcends earthly limitations and allows the lovers to commune on a higher plane of existence. The imagery of angels dropping "some golden orb of perfect song" into their silent communion suggests the divine inspiration that love can bring.

### Literary Devices

Browning employs various literary devices to enhance the emotional impact of the poem. Alliteration is used in phrases like "silent, drawing nigh and nigher" to create a sense of intimacy and closeness between the lovers. The metaphor of "lengthening wings break into fire" symbolizes the transformative power of love and the spiritual awakening that occurs when two souls unite. Browning also utilizes personification when she describes the earth as capable of committing "bitter wrong," giving agency to the natural world in expressing the challenges that love may face.

### Historical and Personal Context

Elizabeth Barrett Browning was a prominent Victorian poet known for her exploration of themes such as love, spirituality, and social justice. Sonnet 22 was written during a period when Browning was deeply in love with her future husband, Robert Browning, and reflects her belief in the transcendent power of love to overcome earthly obstacles. The Victorian era was characterized by strict social conventions and moral values, and Browning's poetry often challenged these norms by celebrating individual freedom and emotional expression.

### Deep Reading

At its core, Sonnet 22 is a meditation on the transformative power of love and the desire for a transcendent connection that defies earthly limitations. The speaker expresses a longing to remain in a state of pure, spiritual communion with their beloved, away from the distractions and conflicts of the world. The contrast between the "contrarious moods of men" and the "pure spirits" of the lovers highlights the isolating yet liberating nature of true love. Through the imagery of darkness and the "death-hour," Browning suggests that love provides a sanctuary from the harsh realities of life, offering a temporary respite where two souls can find solace and unity. Ultimately, Sonnet 22 celebrates the enduring strength of love and its ability to elevate the human spirit to a higher realm of existence.

## A Day Dream by Emily Bronte

```
On a sunny brae, alone I lay
One summer afternoon;
It was the marriage-time of May
With her young lover, June.

From her mother's heart, seemed loath to part
That queen of bridal charms,
But her father smiled on the fairest child
He ever held in his arms.

The trees did wave their plumy crests,
The glad birds caroled clear;
And I, of all the wedding guests,
Was only sullen there!

There was not one, but wished to shun
My aspect void of cheer;
The very grey rocks, looking on,
Asked, "What do you here?"

And I could utter no reply;
In sooth, I did not know
Why I had brought a clouded eye
To greet the general glow.

So, resting on a heathy bank,
I took my heart to me;
And we together sadly sank
Into a reverie.

We thought, "When winter comes again,
Where will these bright things be?
All vanished, like a vision vain,
An unreal mockery!

The birds that now so blithely sing,
Through deserts, frozen dry,
Poor spectres of the perished spring,
In famished troops, will fly.

And why should we be glad at all?
The leaf is hardly green,
Before a token of its fall
Is on the surface seen!"

Now, whether it were really so,
I never could be sure;
But as in fit of peevish woe,
I stretched me on the moor.

A thousand thousand gleaming fires
Seemed kindling in the air;
A thousand thousand silvery lyres
Resounded far and near:

Methought, the very breath I breathed
Was full of sparks divine,
And all my heather-couch was wreathed
By that celestial shine!

And, while the wide earth echoing rung
To their strange minstrelsy,
The little glittering spirits sung,
Or seemed to sing, to me.

"O mortal! mortal! let them die;
Let time and tears destroy,
That we may overflow the sky
With universal joy!

Let grief distract the sufferer's breast,
And night obscure his way;
They hasten him to endless rest,
And everlasting day.

To thee the world is like a tomb,
A desert's naked shore;
To us, in unimagined bloom,
It brightens more and more!

And could we lift the veil, and give
One brief glimpse to thine eye,
Thou wouldst rejoice for those that live,
Because they live to die."

The music ceased; the noonday dream,
Like dream of night, withdrew;
But Fancy, still, will sometimes deem
Her fond creation true.
```

## The Fact that Earth is Heaven -- by Emily Dickinson

```
The Fact that Earth is Heaven --
Whether Heaven is Heaven or not
If not an Affidavit
Of that specific Spot
Not only must confirm us
That it is not for us
But that it would affront us
To dwell in such a place --
```
