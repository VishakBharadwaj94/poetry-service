## "Heaven" has different Signs -- to me -- by Emily Dickinson

```
"Heaven" has different Signs -- to me --
Sometimes, I think that Noon
Is but a symbol of the Place --
And when again, at Dawn,

A mighty look runs round the World
And settles in the Hills --
An Awe if it should be like that
Upon the Ignorance steals --

The Orchard, when the Sun is on --
The Triumph of the Birds
When they together Victory make --
Some Carnivals of Clouds --

The Rapture of a finished Day --
Returning to the West --
All these -- remind us of the place
That Men call "paradise" --

Itself be fairer -- we suppose --
But how Ourself, shall be
Adorned, for a Superior Grace --
Not yet, our eyes can see --
```

## A Dream Within A Dream by Edgar Allan Poe

```
Take this kiss upon the brow!
And, in parting from you now,
Thus much let me avow--
You are not wrong, who deem
That my days have been a dream:
Yet if hope has flown away
In a night, or in a day,
In a vision or in none,
Is it therefore the less _gone_?
_All_ that we see or seem
Is but a dream within a dream.

I stand amid the roar
Of a surf-tormented shore,
And I hold within my hand
Grains of the golden sand--
How few! yet how they creep
Through my fingers to the deep
While I weep--while I weep!
O God! can I not grasp
Them with a tighter clasp?
O God! can I not save
_One_ from the pitiless wave?
Is _all_ that we see or seem
But a dream within a dream?
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The structured form of the poem adds to its sense of order and control, contrasting with the chaotic and uncertain themes explored within the verses. The meter is mostly iambic, with lines alternating between tetrameter and trimeter, creating a rhythmic and flowing quality to the poem.

Through vivid imagery, Poe evokes a sense of loss and despair. In the first stanza, the speaker laments the passing of time and the intangible nature of hope, symbolized by grains of sand slipping through their fingers. The image of the surf-tormented shore emphasizes the relentless and unstoppable passage of time, highlighting the speaker's sense of powerlessness in the face of inevitable change. The poem explores the existential question of the nature of reality and the futility of trying to hold onto fleeting moments.

### Literary Devices

Poe employs several literary devices to convey the themes of transience and loss in the poem. The repetition of the phrase "A dream within a dream" serves as a refrain that underscores the central idea of the impermanence of reality. Alliteration is used in phrases like "grains of the golden sand" to create a musical quality and draw attention to key images. The use of rhetorical questions, such as "O God! can I not grasp / Them with a tighter clasp?" heightens the speaker's sense of desperation and helplessness in the face of inevitable change. Through these devices, Poe creates a sense of melancholy and introspection in the poem.
