## How still, how happy! by Emily Bronte

```
How still, how happy! Those are words
That once would scarce agree together;
I loved the plashing of the surge -
The changing heaven the breezy weather,

More than smooth seas and cloudless skies
And solemn, soothing, softened airs
That in the forest woke no sighs
And from the green spray shook no tears.

How still, how happy! now I feel
Where silence dwells is sweeter far
Than laughing mirth's most joyous swell
However pure its raptures are.

Come, sit down on this sunny stone:
'Tis wintry light o'er flowerless moors -
But sit - for we are all alone
And clear expand heaven's breathless shores.

I could think in the withered grass
Spring's budding wreaths we might discern;
The violet's eye might shyly flash
And young leaves shoot among the fern.

It is but thought - full many a night
The snow shall clothe those hills afar
And storms shall add a drearier blight
And winds shall wage a wilder war,

Before the lark may herald in
Fresh foliage twined with blossoms fair
And summer days again begin
Their glory - haloed crown to wear.

Yet my heart loves December's smile
As much as July's golden beam;
Then let us sit and watch the while
The blue ice curdling on the stream -
```

## The Mill-Water by Edward Thomas

```
ONLY the sound remains
Of the old mill;
Gone is the wheel;
On the prone roof and walls the nettle reigns.

Water that toils no more
Dangles white locks
And, falling, mocks
The music of the mill-wheel's busy roar.

Pretty to see, by day
Its sound is naught
Compared with thought
And talk and noise of labour and of play.

Night makes the difference.
In calm moonlight,
Gloom infinite,
The sound comes surging in upon the sense:

Solitude, company,--
When it is night,--
Grief or delight
By it must haunted or concluded be.

Often the silentness
Has but this one
Companion;
Wherever one creeps in the other is:

Sometimes a thought is drowned
By it, sometimes
Out of it climbs;
All thoughts begin or end upon this sound,

Only the idle foam
Of water falling
Changelessly calling,
Where once men had a work-place and a home.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "The Mill-Water" by Edward Thomas is structured as a single stanza with sixteen lines. The poem does not follow a strict rhyme scheme, but there are instances of rhyme within the lines, such as "mill" and "reigns" in lines 1 and 4, and "locks" and "mocks" in lines 5 and 6. The lack of a consistent rhyme scheme mirrors the theme of change and loss depicted in the poem. The meter is primarily iambic, with alternating lines of tetrameter and trimeter, creating a rhythmic flow that mimics the movement of water.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem is the passage of time and the inevitable changes that come with it. The imagery of the old mill being overtaken by nature, with the nettle reigning on the roof and walls, symbolizes the abandonment and decay of a once vibrant place. The contrast between the daytime and nighttime settings highlights the different perspectives one can have on solitude and companionship, grief and delight. The imagery of water falling continuously, with its "white locks" and "idle foam," serves as a poignant reminder of the relentless passage of time and the loss of human presence in the mill.

### Literary Devices

Thomas employs various literary devices to enhance the themes and imagery of the poem. Personification is used to describe the water as having "white locks" and "mocking" the music of the mill-wheel. This personification serves to emphasize the water's transformation from a working force to a silent observer. The repetition of the word "sound" throughout the poem underscores the importance of auditory perception in shaping one's experience of solitude and companionship. Additionally, the juxtaposition of "thought" and "talk and noise of labour and of play" highlights the different ways in which individuals engage with their surroundings.

### Historical and Personal Context

Edward Thomas, a British poet known for his nature-themed works, wrote "The Mill-Water" during a period of great societal and industrial change in England. The poem reflects Thomas's contemplation of the impact of modernization on rural landscapes and traditional ways of life. The imagery of the old mill being silenced and overgrown by nature can be seen as a commentary on the loss of community and craftsmanship in the face of industrialization.

### Deep Reading

Through the depiction of the old mill and the water that once powered it, Thomas explores the transient nature of human existence and the enduring presence of natural elements. The contrast between the bustling activity of the mill-wheel and the silent, contemplative nature of the water underscores the shift from labor to reflection, from noise to solitude. The poem invites readers to consider the ways in which external forces shape our perceptions of time, memory, and the passage of life. Ultimately, "The Mill-Water" serves as a poignant meditation on the inevitability of change and the resilience of nature in the face of human progress.
