## Sonnet 30 - I see thine image through my tears to-night by Elizabeth Barrett Browning

```
I see thine image through my tears to-night,
And yet to-day I saw thee smiling. How
Refer the cause?—Beloved, is it thou
Or I, who makes me sad? The acolyte
Amid the chanted joy and thankful rite
May so fall flat, with pale insensate brow,
On the altar-stair. I hear thy voice and vow,
Perplexed, uncertain, since thou art out of sight,
As he, in his swooning ears, the choir's Amen.
Beloved, dost thou love? or did I see all
The glory as I dreamed, and fainted when
Too vehement light dilated my ideal,
For my soul's eyes? Will that light come again,
As now these tears come—falling hot and real?
```

## Lines Written In Early Spring by William Wordsworth

```
I heard a thousand blended notes,
While in a grove I sate reclined,
In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts
Bring sad thoughts to the mind.

To her fair works did Nature link
The human soul that through me ran;
And much it grieved my heart to think
What man has made of man.

Through primrose tufts, in that green bower,
The periwinkle trailed its wreaths;
And 'tis my faith that every flower
Enjoys the air it breathes.

The birds around me hopped and played,
Their thoughts I cannot measure:--
But the least motion which they made
It seemed a thrill of pleasure.

The budding twigs spread out their fan,
To catch the breezy air;
And I must think, do all I can,
That there was pleasure there.

If this belief from heaven be sent,
If such be Nature's holy plan,
Have I not reason to lament
What man has made of man?
```

### Themes and Imagery

The central themes of the poem revolve around the contrast between the serene beauty of nature and the destructive nature of humanity.

The imagery of the blooming flowers, chirping birds, and swaying twigs creates a sense of harmony and joy in the natural world. However, this beauty is contrasted with the melancholy realization of the harm that humans have inflicted upon one another.

### Literary Devices

Wordsworth employs several literary devices to convey his message effectively. Personification is used to ascribe human-like qualities to nature, such as when he suggests that flowers "enjoy the air they breathe" or that twigs spread out "to catch the breezy air." This personification serves to emphasize the interconnectedness between humans and nature. The poem also features juxtaposition, as Wordsworth juxtaposes the beauty of nature with the cruelty of human behavior, highlighting the stark contrast between the two.

### Historical and Personal Context

Written during the Romantic era, a period marked by a profound appreciation for nature and a rejection of industrialization, Wordsworth's poem reflects the romantic ideals of harmony with the natural world.

Wordsworth's concerns about the impact of industrialization and societal progress on the environment and human relationships are evident in this poem.

### Deep Reading

Wordsworth's contemplation of the beauty and tranquility of the natural world juxtaposed with the harsh reality of human behavior prompts readers to reflect on their own role in preserving the delicate balance of nature. The poem serves as a poignant reminder of the importance of cherishing and protecting the environment, as well as fostering empathy and compassion towards one another. Through his musings on the inherent goodness of nature and the destructive tendencies of man, Wordsworth urges readers to reevaluate their relationship with the world around them.

## The Thread of Life by Christina Rossetti

```
I
The irresponsive silence of the land,
The irresponsive sounding of the sea,
Speak both one message of one sense to me:--
Aloof, aloof, we stand aloof, so stand
Thou too aloof bound with the flawless band
Of inner solitude; we bind not thee;
But who from thy self-chain shall set thee free?
What heart shall touch thy heart? what hand thy hand?--
And I am sometimes proud and sometimes meek,
And sometimes I remember days of old
When fellowship seemed not so far to seek
And all the world and I seemed much less cold,
And at the rainbow's foot lay surely gold,
And hope felt strong and life itself not weak.

II
Thus am I mine own prison. Everything
Around me free and sunny and at ease:
Or if in shadow, in a shade of trees
Which the sun kisses, where the gay birds sing
And where all winds make various murmuring;
Where bees are found, with honey for the bees;
Where sounds are music, and where silences
Are music of an unlike fashioning.
Then gaze I at the merrymaking crew,
And smile a moment and a moment sigh
Thinking: Why can I not rejoice with you?
But soon I put the foolish fancy by:
I am not what I have nor what I do;
But what I was I am, I am even I.

III
Therefore myself is that one only thing
I hold to use or waste, to keep or give;
My sole possession every day I live,
And still mine own despite Time's winnowing.
Ever mine own, while moons and seasons bring
From crudeness ripeness mellow and sanitive;
Ever mine own, till Death shall ply his sieve;
And still mine own, when saints break grave and sing.
And this myself as king unto my King
I give, to Him Who gave Himself for me;
Who gives Himself to me, and bids me sing
A sweet new song of His redeemed set free;
he bids me sing: O death, where is thy sting?
And sing: O grave, where is thy victory?
```
