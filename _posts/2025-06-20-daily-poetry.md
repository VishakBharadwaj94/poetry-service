## Silence by Edgar Allan Poe

```
There are some qualities--some incorporate things,
  That have a double life, which thus is made
A type of that twin entity which springs
  From matter and light, evinced in solid and shade.
There is a twofold _Silence_--sea and shore--
  Body and soul. One dwells in lonely places,
  Newly with grass o'ergrown; some solemn graces,
Some human memories and tearful lore,
Render him terrorless: his name's "No More."
He is the corporate Silence: dread him not!
  No power hath he of evil in himself;
But should some urgent fate (untimely lot!)
  Bring thee to meet his shadow (nameless elf,
That haunteth the lone regions where hath trod
No foot of man), commend thyself to God!
```

Overall, the form, structure, meter, and rhyme of the poem contribute to its contemplative and introspective tone.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem revolves around the concept of silence and its dual nature. Poe explores the idea that silence can exist in different forms, such as the silence of the sea and the shore, or the silence of the body and soul. Through vivid imagery, he paints a picture of a silent, lonely place overgrown with grass, inhabited by memories and emotions, both solemn and tearful. This imagery evokes a sense of melancholy and introspection, inviting the reader to reflect on the deeper meanings of silence and solitude.

The poem also touches on themes of fear and mortality, suggesting that silence, personified as "No More," is not inherently evil but can become terrifying when confronted unexpectedly. The references to "some urgent fate" and the "nameless elf" that haunts desolate regions add a touch of mystery and foreboding to the poem's imagery.

### Literary Devices

Poe employs several literary devices to enhance the thematic elements and imagery in the poem. One prominent device is personification, as silence is personified as a living entity with characteristics and actions. For example, silence is described as having a "double life" and being a "twin entity," giving it a human-like quality. Additionally, the use of alliteration in phrases like "solid and shade" and "tearful lore" adds a musical quality to the poem, enhancing its lyrical flow.

The poem also features symbolism, with silence serving as a symbol for the unknown and the mysteries of existence. The references to grass-covered lonely places and shadowy regions evoke a sense of unease and otherworldliness, symbolizing the darker aspects of human experience.

### Historical and Personal Context

Written during the 19th century, Edgar Allan Poe's work often reflected his personal struggles and anxieties. "Silence" can be seen as a reflection of Poe's own preoccupation with themes of death, loss, and the unknown. Poe's fascination with the macabre and the supernatural is evident in the poem's haunting imagery and eerie atmosphere.

During Poe's lifetime, the Romantic movement was in full swing, emphasizing individualism, emotion, and the sublime. "Silence" aligns with Romantic ideals by exploring the depths of human experience and the mysteries of the natural world. The poem's introspective tone and introspective exploration of silence reflect the Romantic emphasis on inner emotions and contemplation.

### Deep Reading

In a deeper analysis, "Silence" can be interpreted as a meditation on the transient nature of life and the inevitability of death. The personification of silence as a benign entity that becomes terrifying in certain circumstances can be seen as a metaphor for the unknown and the fear of the afterlife. By urging the reader to "commend thyself to God" when faced with silence, Poe emphasizes the importance of faith and spirituality in confronting the mysteries of existence.

The poem's fragmented structure and lack of a consistent rhyme scheme mirror the fragmented nature of human experience and the unpredictability of life. The shifting perspectives and dualities within the poem suggest a complex understanding of silence as both a comforting presence and a source of dread. Overall, "Silence" invites readers to contemplate the deeper meanings of solitude, memory, and mortality, resonating with Poe's own fascination with the darker aspects of human consciousness.

## Merry Autumn by Paul Laurence Dunbar

```
It's all a farce,—these tales they tell
  About the breezes sighing,
And moans astir o'er field and dell,
  Because the year is dying.

Such principles are most absurd,—
  I care not who first taught 'em;
There's nothing known to beast or bird
  To make a solemn autumn.

In solemn times, when grief holds sway
  With countenance distressing,
You'll note the more of black and gray
  Will then be used in dressing.

Now purple tints are all around;
  The sky is blue and mellow;
And e'en the grasses turn the ground
  From modest green to yellow.

The seed burs all with laughter crack
  On featherweed and jimson;
And leaves that should be dressed in black
  Are all decked out in crimson.

A butterfly goes winging by;
  A singing bird comes after;
And Nature, all from earth to sky,
  Is bubbling o'er with laughter.

The ripples wimple on the rills,
  Like sparkling little lasses;
The sunlight runs along the hills,
  And laughs among the grasses.

The earth is just so full of fun
  It really can't contain it;
And streams of mirth so freely run
  The heavens seem to rain it.

Don't talk to me of solemn days
  In autumn's time of splendor,
Because the sun shows fewer rays,
  And these grow slant and slender.

Why, it's the climax of the year,—
  The highest time of living!—
Till naturally its bursting cheer
  Just melts into thanksgiving.
```

## The Vision of the Archangels by Rupert Brooke

```
Slowly up silent peaks, the white edge of the world,
Trod four archangels, clear against the unheeding sky,
Bearing, with quiet even steps, and great wings furled,
A little dingy coffin; where a child must lie,
It was so tiny. (Yet, you had fancied, God could never
Have bidden a child turn from the spring and the sunlight,
And shut him in that lonely shell, to drop for ever
Into the emptiness and silence, into the night.…)

They then from the sheer summit cast, and watched it fall,
Through unknown glooms, that frail black coffin—and therein
God’s little pitiful Body lying, worn and thin,
And curled up like some crumpled, lonely flower petal—
Till it was no more visible; then turned again
With sorrowful quiet faces downward to the plain.
```

### Literary Devices
