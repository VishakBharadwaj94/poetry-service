## A Memory by Rupert Brooke

```
(From a sonnet-sequence)


Somewhile before the dawn I rose, and stept
Softly along the dim way to your room,
And found you sleeping in the quiet gloom,
And holiness about you as you slept.
I knelt there; till your waking fingers crept
About my head, and held it. I had rest
Unhoped this side of Heaven, beneath your breast.
I knelt a long time, still; nor even wept.

It was great wrong you did me; and for gain
Of that poor moment’s kindliness, and ease,
And sleepy mother-comfort!
Child, you know
How easily love leaps out to dreams like these,
Who has seen them true. And love that’s wakened so
Takes all too long to lay asleep again.
```

## Sympathy by Paul Laurence Dunbar

```
I know what the caged bird feels, alas!
When the sun is bright on the upland slopes;
When the wind stirs soft through the springing grass,
And the river flows like a stream of glass;
When the first bird sings and the first bud opes,
And the faint perfume from its chalice steals--
I know what the caged bird feels!

I know why the caged bird beats his wing
Till its blood is red on the cruel bars;
For he must fly back to his perch and cling
When he fain would be on the bough a-swing;
And a pain still throbs in the old, old scars
And they pulse again with a keener sting--
I know why he beats his wing!

I know why the caged bird sings, ah me,
When his wing is bruised and his bosom sore,--
When he beats his bars and he would be free;
It is not a carol of joy or glee,
But a prayer that he sends from his heart's deep core,
But a plea, that upward to Heaven he flings--
I know why the caged bird sings!
```

The bright sun, soft wind, flowing river, and blooming flowers all serve to contrast the bird's imprisoned existence, highlighting its desire for liberation.

### Literary Devices

Dunbar employs several literary devices to enhance the poem's emotional impact. One notable device is personification, as the caged bird is imbued with human emotions and actions. The bird's beating wings, bruised bosom, and heartfelt song serve as powerful symbols of its struggle for freedom and expression. Additionally, the use of repetition in lines such as "I know what the caged bird feels" and "I know why the caged bird sings" emphasizes the speaker's empathy and understanding of the bird's plight.

### Historical and Personal Context

## To Marie Louise (Shew) by Edgar Allan Poe

```
Not long ago, the writer of these lines,
In the mad pride of intellectuality,
Maintained "the power of words"--denied that ever
A thought arose within the human brain
Beyond the utterance of the human tongue:
And now, as if in mockery of that boast,
Two words--two foreign soft dissyllables--
Italian tones, made only to be murmured
By angels dreaming in the moonlit "dew
That hangs like chains of pearl on Hermon hill,"--
Have stirred from out the abysses of his heart,
Unthought-like thoughts that are the souls of thought,
Richer, far wilder, far diviner visions
Than even the seraph harper, Israfel,
(Who has "the sweetest voice of all God's creatures,")
Could hope to utter. And I! my spells are broken.
The pen falls powerless from my shivering hand.
With thy dear name as text, though hidden by thee,
I cannot write--I cannot speak or think--
Alas, I cannot feel; for 'tis not feeling,
This standing motionless upon the golden
Threshold of the wide-open gate of dreams,
Gazing, entranced, adown the gorgeous vista,
And thrilling as I see, upon the right,
Upon the left, and all the way along,
Amid empurpled vapors, far away
To where the prospect terminates--_thee only_!
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme
The poem "To Marie Louise (Shew)" by Edgar Allan Poe consists of a single stanza with a total of 28 lines. It does not adhere to a specific rhyme scheme or meter, which allows for a sense of free verse. The lack of a consistent rhyme scheme or meter mirrors the speaker's tumultuous emotions and inner turmoil as he grapples with his feelings for Marie Louise. The irregular structure of the poem reflects the chaotic nature of the speaker's thoughts as he struggles to articulate his emotions.

### Themes and Imagery
The central theme of the poem revolves around the power of love and its ability to inspire profound emotions and thoughts within an individual. The speaker's intense feelings for Marie Louise are depicted through vivid imagery, such as "Italian tones, made only to be murmured by angels dreaming in the moonlit dew." This imagery conveys a sense of ethereal beauty and otherworldly sensations that Marie Louise invokes in the speaker. The poem also explores the idea of the limitations of language in expressing deep emotions, as seen in the line "I cannot write--I cannot speak or think--Alas, I cannot feel."

### Literary Devices
Poe employs several literary devices throughout the poem to enhance its emotional impact. One prominent device is alliteration, as seen in the line "mad pride of intellectuality." Alliteration not only creates a musical quality but also emphasizes the speaker's arrogance in the past. The use of simile is evident in phrases like "the wide-open gate of dreams," which adds a dreamlike quality to the imagery. Additionally, personification is employed when the speaker refers to his "spells" being broken, suggesting a loss of his poetic abilities due to his overwhelming emotions for Marie Louise.

### Historical and Personal Context
The poem is believed to have been written for Marie Louise Shew, a close friend and confidante of Poe during his tumultuous life. The intense emotions expressed in the poem may reflect Poe's own feelings towards Marie Louise or his struggles with love and loss in his personal life. Poe's tumultuous relationships and tragic experiences likely influenced the themes of love, longing, and the limitations of language in expressing deep emotions in the poem.

### Deep Reading
One of the most striking aspects of the poem is the speaker's admission of the inadequacy of language in capturing the depth of his feelings for Marie Louise. The line "A thought arose within the human brain beyond the utterance of the human tongue" highlights the speaker's realization that some emotions are too profound to be articulated through words alone. This existential exploration of the limitations of language in conveying complex emotions adds a layer of depth to the poem.

Furthermore, the speaker's overwhelming emotions for Marie Louise are portrayed as both a source of inspiration and a source of anguish. The imagery of standing at the "golden Threshold of the wide-open gate of dreams" conveys a sense of both awe and despair, as the speaker is entranced by the beauty of his feelings yet unable to fully express them. This juxtaposition of emotions adds complexity to the speaker's portrayal of love and longing.

In conclusion, "To Marie Louise (Shew)" is a poignant exploration of the power of love, the limitations of language, and the tumultuous emotions that accompany deep affection. Through vivid imagery, literary devices, and personal introspection, Poe creates a heartfelt and introspective poem that resonates with readers on a profound emotional level.
