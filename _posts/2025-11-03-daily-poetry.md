## A Tale (Epilogue to "The Two Poets of Croisic.") by Robert Browning

```
What a pretty tale you told me
  Once upon a time
--Said you found it somewhere (scold me!)
  Was it prose or was it rhyme,
Greek or Latin? Greek, you said,
While your shoulder propped my head.

Anyhow there's no forgetting
  This much if no more,
That a poet (pray, no petting!)
  Yes, a bard, sir, famed of yore,
Went where suchlike used to go,
Singing for a prize, you know.

Well, he had to sing, nor merely
  Sing but play the lyre;
Playing was important clearly
  Quite as singing: I desire,
Sir, you keep the fact in mind
For a purpose that's behind.

There stood he, while deep attention
  Held the judges round,
--Judges able, I should mention,
  To detect the slightest sound
Sung or played amiss: such ears
Had old judges, it appears!

None the less he sang out boldly,
  Played in time and tune,
Till the judges, weighing coldly
  Each note's worth, seemed, late or soon,
Sure to smile "In vain one tries
Picking faults out: take the prize!"

When, a mischief! Were they seven
  Strings the lyre possessed?
Oh, and afterwards eleven,
  Thank you! Well, sir,--who had guessed
Such ill luck in store?--it happed
One of those same seven strings snapped.

All was lost, then! No! a cricket
  (What "cicada"? Pooh!)
--Some mad thing that left its thicket
  For mere love of music--flew
With its little heart on fire,
Lighted on the crippled lyre.

So that when (Ah joy!) our singer
  For his truant string
Feels with disconcerted finger,
  What does cricket else but fling
Fiery heart forth, sound the note
Wanted by the throbbing throat?

Ay and, ever to the ending,
  Cricket chirps at need,
Executes the hand's intending,
  Promptly, perfectly,--indeed
Saves the singer from defeat
With her chirrup low and sweet.

Till, at ending, all the judges
  Cry with one assent
"Take the prize--a prize who grudges
  Such a voice and instrument?
Why, we took your lyre for harp,
So it shrilled us forth F sharp!"

Did the conqueror spurn the creature
  Once its service done?
That's no such uncommon feature
  In the case when Music's son
Finds his Lotte's power too spent
For aiding soul development.

No! This other, on returning
  Homeward, prize in hand,
Satisfied his bosom's yearning:
   (Sir, I hope you understand!)
--Said "Some record there must be
Of this cricket's help to me!"

So, he made himself a statue:
   Marble stood, life size;
On the lyre, he pointed at you,
   Perched his partner in the prize;
Never more apart you found
Her, he throned, from him, she crowned.

That's the tale: its application?
   Somebody I know
Hopes one day for reputation
  Thro' his poetry that's--Oh,
All so learned and so wise
And deserving of a prize!

If he gains one, will some ticket
   When his statue's built,
Tell the gazer "'Twas a cricket
   Helped my crippled lyre, whose lilt
Sweet and low, when strength usurped
Softness' place i' the scale, she chirped?

"For as victory was nighest,
  While I sang and played,--
With my lyre at lowest, highest,
   Right alike,--one string that made
'Love' sound soft was snapt in twain
Never to be heard again,--

"Had not a kind cricket fluttered,
   Perched upon the place
Vacant left, and duly uttered
   'Love, Love, Love,' whene'er the bass
Asked the treble to atone
For its somewhat sombre drone."

But you don't know music! Wherefore
   Keep on casting pearls
To a--poet? All I care for
   Is--to tell him that a girl's
"Love" comes aptly in when gruff
Grows his singing, (There, enough!)
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "A Tale" by Robert Browning is written in a narrative form with a conversational tone. It consists of three stanzas with irregular line lengths, contributing to a sense of casual storytelling. The poem does not adhere to a strict meter, allowing for a more natural flow of speech. The rhyme scheme is irregular, with some couplets (such as "rhyme" and "time" in lines 2-3) interspersed with unrhymed lines, creating a playful and conversational rhythm.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem revolves around the idea of unexpected help and the importance of collaboration in achieving success. The imagery of the poet playing the lyre and the cricket assisting with the missing string serves as a metaphor for the idea that sometimes, unexpected sources can come to our aid in times of need. The image of the cricket perched on the lyre, chirping in tune with the singer, symbolizes the idea of harmony and cooperation.

### Literary Devices

Browning employs several literary devices in the poem, including alliteration (e.g., "Fiery heart forth, sound the note" in lines 26-27), personification (e.g., the cricket being described as having a "little heart on fire" in line 22), and metaphor (e.g., the cricket symbolizing unexpected help and collaboration). The use of dialogue in the poem adds a conversational tone, engaging the reader in the storytelling.

### Historical and Personal Context

Robert Browning was a Victorian poet known for his dramatic monologues and exploration of complex psychological themes. "A Tale" reflects Browning's interest in storytelling and the power of poetry to convey moral lessons. The poem also touches on the role of art in society and the idea of recognizing and honoring those who contribute to our success, even in unexpected ways.

### Deep Reading

On a deeper level, "A Tale" can be seen as a reflection on the nature of creativity and the collaborative process of art. The poet's reliance on the cricket to complete the music on the broken lyre highlights the idea that art is often a collaborative effort, drawing on diverse sources of inspiration. The poem suggests that true creativity can emerge from unexpected places and that acknowledging and honoring those who contribute to our work is essential. Browning's use of the metaphor of the cricket as a muse or creative partner underscores the idea that art is a communal endeavor, enriched by the contributions of others.

## Hayeswater by Matthew Arnold

```
A region desolate and wild.
Black, chafing water: and afloat,
And lonely as a truant child
In a waste wood, a single boat:
No mast, no sails are set thereon;
It moves, but never moveth on:
And welters like a human thing
Amid the wild waves weltering.

Behind, a buried vale doth sleep,
Far down the torrent cleaves its way:
In front the dumb rock rises steep,
A fretted wall of blue and grey;
Of shooting cliff and crumbled stone
With many a wild weed overgrown:
All else, black water: and afloat,
One rood from shore, that single boat.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "Hayeswater" by Matthew Arnold consists of two stanzas, each with eight lines. The rhyme scheme is ABABCCDD, with a consistent pattern of alternate rhymes until the final two lines that rhyme with each other. This rhyme scheme creates a sense of stability and resolution at the end of each stanza. 

In terms of meter, the poem is written in iambic tetrameter, with four iambs (a metrical foot consisting of an unstressed syllable followed by a stressed syllable) per line. This consistent meter contributes to the poem's rhythmic flow and musical quality. Additionally, the use of enjambment, where lines run on to the next without punctuation, creates a sense of continuity and fluidity in the poem's structure.

### Themes and Imagery

The poem explores themes of desolation, loneliness, and stagnation. The setting of a "region desolate and wild" with "black, chafing water" and a "lonely" boat conveys a sense of isolation and emptiness. The imagery of the boat "moves, but never moveth on" and "welters like a human thing" suggests a feeling of being stuck or trapped in a state of inertia. The description of the landscape as "a fretted wall of blue and grey" and "shooting cliff and crumbled stone" evokes a sense of ruggedness and harshness in the environment.

The contrast between the buried vale "far down" and the "dumb rock rises steep" highlights a sense of division between the hidden, buried aspects of the landscape and the stark, exposed elements. Overall, the imagery in the poem serves to create a vivid picture of a desolate and stagnant natural world.

### Literary Devices

Arnold employs various literary devices to enhance the poem's impact. One notable device is personification, as seen in the description of the boat as "lonely as a truant child" and "welters like a human thing." This personification humanizes the boat and emphasizes its isolation and helplessness in the vast, indifferent landscape.

The use of alliteration, such as in "black, chafing water" and "wild waves weltering," creates a musical quality and emphasizes the harshness of the surroundings. Additionally, the repetition of the word "weltering" in the final line of the first stanza reinforces the sense of chaos and turbulence in the scene.

### Historical and Personal Context

Matthew Arnold was a Victorian poet known for his introspective and often melancholic themes. "Hayeswater" was written during a period of industrialization and social change in England, where the natural world was increasingly threatened by human encroachment. The poem can be seen as a reflection on the alienation and disconnection that can arise from modernization and the loss of connection to the natural world.

Arnold's own background as a cultural critic and educator likely influenced his portrayal of the desolate landscape in "Hayeswater." His concern for the erosion of traditional values and the impact of industrial society on the environment can be seen in the poem's themes of isolation and stagnation.

### Deep Reading

At its core, "Hayeswater" can be interpreted as a meditation on the human condition and the struggle to find meaning and purpose in a world that may seem indifferent or hostile. The image of the solitary boat adrift in a desolate landscape serves as a metaphor for the individual's journey through life, navigating through uncertainty and isolation.

The buried vale and the rising rock symbolize hidden depths and obstacles that must be overcome, while the black water represents the unknown and the potential for growth and change. The poem's evocative imagery and introspective tone invite readers to contemplate their own place in the world and the challenges they face in finding direction and meaning in a complex and often unforgiving environment.
