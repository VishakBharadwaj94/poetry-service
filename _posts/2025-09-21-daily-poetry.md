## Hope by Emily Bronte

```
Hope was but a timid friend;
She sat without the grated den,
Watching how my fate would tend,
Even as selfish-hearted men.

She was cruel in her fear;
Through the bars, one dreary day,
I looked out to see her there,
And she turned her face away!

Like a false guard, false watch keeping,
Still, in strife, she whispered peace;
She would sing while I was weeping;
If I listened, she would cease.

False she was, and unrelenting;
When my last joys strewed the ground,
Even Sorrow saw, repenting,
Those sad relics scattered round;

Hope, whose whisper would have given
Balm to all my frenzied pain,
Stretched her wings, and soared to heaven,
Went, and ne'er returned again!
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "Hope" by Emily Bronte consists of four stanzas, each with four lines. The rhyme scheme is ABAB, with alternating end rhymes in each quatrain. The meter is irregular, with varying syllable counts in each line, creating a sense of unpredictability and instability that mirrors the theme of the poem. This lack of strict meter adds to the overall feeling of despair and hopelessness conveyed in the verses.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem is the betrayal and abandonment by hope. The speaker personifies hope as a "timid friend" who ultimately proves to be false and unrelenting. The imagery of hope sitting "without the grated den" and turning away when the speaker looks out to see her emphasizes the idea of hope as something elusive and unattainable. The contrast between hope's supposed ability to bring peace and comfort and her ultimate abandonment of the speaker highlights the fickle nature of hope and its tendency to disappear when most needed.

### Literary Devices

Bronte employs several literary devices in the poem to convey the speaker's sense of disillusionment with hope. Personification is used to give hope human-like qualities, such as being "cruel in her fear" and "false" in her actions. The use of imagery, such as the bars of the den and the scattered relics of joy, creates a vivid picture of the speaker's emotional state and the fleeting nature of hope. The repetition of the word "false" and the contrast between hope's promises and her actions serve to emphasize the speaker's feelings of betrayal and disappointment.

### Historical and Personal Context

Emily Bronte, best known for her novel "Wuthering Heights," was part of the Bronte literary family, which also included her sisters Charlotte and Anne. The Bronte sisters faced many challenges and tragedies in their lives, including the early deaths of their mother and two older sisters. This background of personal loss and hardship likely influenced Bronte's exploration of themes such as despair, loneliness, and the fleeting nature of hope in her poetry and prose.

### Deep Reading

The poem "Hope" can be seen as a reflection on the human experience of facing disappointment and loss. The speaker's disillusionment with hope reflects a deeper exploration of the fragility of human emotions and the struggle to find solace in difficult times. The final stanza, where hope "stretched her wings, and soared to heaven, Went, and ne'er returned again," conveys a sense of finality and resignation to the idea that hope may not always be a reliable source of comfort. Ultimately, the poem serves as a poignant reminder of the complexities of hope and the ways in which it can both uplift and betray us in our darkest moments.

## The Little Dog's Day by Rupert Brooke

```
All in the town were still asleep,
When the sun came up with a shout and a leap.
In the lonely streets unseen by man,
A little dog danced. And the day began.

All his life he'd been good, as far as he could,
And the poor little beast had done all that he should.
But this morning he swore, by Odin and Thor
And the Canine Valhalla—he'd stand it no more!

So his prayer he got granted—to do just what he wanted,
Prevented by none, for the space of one day.
"Jam incipiebo, sedere facebo,"
In dog-Latin he quoth, "Euge! sophos! hurray!"

He fought with the he-dogs, and winked at the she-dogs,
A thing that had never been heard of before.
"For the stigma of gluttony, I care not a button!" he
Cried, and ate all he could swallow—and more.

He took sinewy lumps from the shins of old frumps,
And mangled the errand-boys—when he could get 'em.
He shammed furious rabies, and bit all the babies,
And followed the cats up the trees, and then ate 'em!"

They thought 'twas the devil was holding a revel,
And sent for the parson to drive him away;
For the town never knew such a hullabaloo
As that little dog raised—till the end of that day.

When the blood-red sun had gone burning down,
And the lights were lit in the little town,
Outside, in the gloom of the twilight grey,
The little dog died when he'd had his day.
```
