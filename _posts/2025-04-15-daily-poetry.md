## For These by Edward Thomas

```
AN acre of land between the shore and the hills,
Upon a ledge that shows my kingdoms three,
The lovely visible earth and sky and sea,
Where what the curlew needs not, the farmer tills:

A house that shall love me as I love it,
Well-hedged, and honoured by a few ash-trees
That linnets, greenfinches, and goldfinches
Shall often visit and make love in and flit:

A garden I need never go beyond,
Broken but neat, whose sunflowers every one
Are fit to be the sign of the Rising Sun:
A spring, a brook's bend, or at least a pond:

For these I ask not, but, neither too late
Nor yet too early, for what men call content,
And also that something may be sent
To be contented with, I ask of fate.
```

The speaker desires a harmonious relationship with his surroundings, symbolized by the house, garden, and natural elements he describes. The imagery of birds like curlews and finches visiting and making love in the ash trees highlights the speaker's desire for a peaceful and intimate connection with nature.

### Literary Devices
Thomas uses several literary devices to enhance the poem's themes and imagery. One notable device is personification, as the speaker describes the house as capable of loving him back. This personification adds a sense of warmth and intimacy to the speaker's relationship with his surroundings. Additionally, the use of simile in "Are fit to be the sign of the Rising Sun" creates a vivid image of vibrant sunflowers symbolizing hope and renewal.

## The Buried Life by Matthew Arnold

```
Light flows our war of mocking words, and yet,
Behold, with tears mine eyes are wet!
I feel a nameless sadness o'er me roll.
Yes, yes, we know that we can jest,
We know, we know that we can smile!
But there's a something in this breast,
To which thy light words bring no rest,
And thy gay smiles no anodyne.
Give me thy hand, and hush awhile,
And turn those limpid eyes on mine,
And let me read there, love! thy inmost soul.

Alas! is even love too weak
To unlock the heart, and let it speak?
Are even lovers powerless to reveal
To one another what indeed they feel?
I knew the mass of men conceal'd
Their thoughts, for fear that if reveal'd
They would by other men be met
With blank indifference, or with blame reproved;
I knew they lived and moved
Trick'd in disguises, alien to the rest
Of men, and alien to themselves--and yet
The same heart beats in every human breast!

But we, my love!--doth a like spell benumb
Our hearts, our voices?--must we too be dumb?

Ah! well for us, if even we,
Even for a moment, can get free
Our heart, and have our lips unchain'd;
For that which seals them hath been deep-ordain'd!

Fate, which foresaw
How frivolous a baby man would be--
By what distractions he would be possess'd,
How he would pour himself in every strife,
And well-nigh change his own identity--
That it might keep from his capricious play
His genuine self, and force him to obey
Even in his own despite his being's law,
Bade through the deep recesses of our breast
The unregarded river of our life
Pursue with indiscernible flow its way;
And that we should not see
The buried stream, and seem to be
Eddying at large in blind uncertainty,
Though driving on with it eternally.

But often, in the world's most crowded streets,
But often, in the din of strife,
There rises an unspeakable desire
After the knowledge of our buried life;
A thirst to spend our fire and restless force
In tracking out our true, original course;
A longing to inquire
Into the mystery of this heart which beats
So wild, so deep in us--to know
Whence our lives come and where they go.
And many a man in his own breast then delves,
But deep enough, alas! none ever mines.
And we have been on many thousand lines,
And we have shown, on each, spirit and power;
But hardly have we, for one little hour,
Been on our own line, have we been ourselves--
Hardly had skill to utter one of all
The nameless feelings that course through our breast,
But they course on for ever unexpress'd.
And long we try in vain to speak and act
Our hidden self, and what we say and do
Is eloquent, is well--but 't#is not true!
And then we will no more be rack'd
With inward striving, and demand
Of all the thousand nothings of the hour
Their stupefying power;
Ah yes, and they benumb us at our call!
Yet still, from time to time, vague and forlorn,
From the soul's subterranean depth upborne
As from an infinitely distant land,
Come airs, and floating echoes, and convey
A melancholy into all our day.
Only--but this is rare--
When a belov{'e}d hand is laid in ours,
When, jaded with the rush and glare
Of the interminable hours,
Our eyes can in another's eyes read clear,
When our world-deafen'd ear
Is by the tones of a loved voice caress'd--
A bolt is shot back somewhere in our breast,
And a lost pulse of feeling stirs again.
The eye sinks inward, and the heart lies plain,
And what we mean, we say, and what we would, we know.
A man becomes aware of his life's flow,
And hears its winding murmur; and he sees
The meadows where it glides, the sun, the breeze.

And there arrives a lull in the hot race
Wherein he doth for ever chase
That flying and elusive shadow, rest.
An air of coolness plays upon his face,
And an unwonted calm pervades his breast.
And then he thinks he knows
The hills where his life rose,
And the sea where it goes.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

In "The Buried Life," Matthew Arnold uses a free verse form with no specific rhyme scheme or meter. The poem consists of five stanzas, each varying in length. The lack of a strict rhyme scheme or meter gives the poem a sense of natural flow, mirroring the introspective and contemplative nature of the speaker's thoughts. The enjambment in the poem also contributes to the sense of continuous thought and reflection, allowing ideas to flow seamlessly from one line to the next.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of "The Buried Life" revolves around the idea of inner conflict and the struggle to express one's true self. The speaker grapples with the notion that societal expectations and personal barriers prevent individuals from fully understanding and articulating their deepest emotions and desires.

The imagery of crowded streets, din of strife, and the unspeakable desire for self-discovery adds depth to the poem's exploration of inner turmoil and the quest for authenticity.

### Literary Devices

Arnold employs various literary devices to convey the complexities of the human experience in "The Buried Life." The use of paradox, such as "light flows our war of mocking words" and "vague and forlorn," highlights the conflicting emotions and desires that the speaker grapples with. The repetition of "we know, we know" emphasizes the facade of jest and smiles that masks deeper emotions. Arnold also utilizes imagery, metaphor, and personification to evoke a sense of introspection and longing for self-discovery. For example, the imagery of a "belov{'e}d hand" unlocking the heart and the personification of Fate as a guiding force within the self enhance the thematic depth of the poem.

### Historical and Personal Context

Matthew Arnold, a prominent Victorian poet and critic, often explored themes of disillusionment, alienation, and the search for meaning in his works. "The Buried Life" reflects the societal pressures and constraints of the Victorian era, where individuals were expected to conform to rigid social norms and suppress their true emotions.

The poem can be seen as a response to the stifling nature of Victorian society and a call for introspection and self-discovery.

## Cavalier Tunes by Robert Browning

```
Kentish Sir Byng stood for his King,
Bidding the crop-headed Parliament swing:
And, pressing a troop unable to stoop
And see the rogues flourish and honest folk droop,
Marched them along, fifty score strong,
Great-hearted gentlemen, singing this song.

God for King Charles! Pym and such carles
To the Devil that prompts 'em their treasonous parles!
Cavaliers, up! Lips from the cup,
Hands from the pasty, nor bite take nor sup
Till you're--

--Marching along, fifty score strong,
  Great-hearted gentlemen, singing this song.

Hampden to hell, and his obsequies knell.
Serve Hazelrig, Fiennes, and young Harry as well!
England, good cheer! Rupert is near!
Kentish and loyalists, keep we not here,

--Marching along, fifty score strong,
  Great-hearted gentlemen, singing this song.

Then, God for King Charles! Pym and his snarls
To the Devil that pricks on such pestilent carles!
Hold by the right, you double your might;
So, onward to Nottingham, fresh for the fight,

--March we along, fifty score strong,
  Great-hearted gentlemen, singing this song!

King Charles, and who'll do him right now?
King Charles, and who's ripe for fight now?
Give a rouse; here's, in hell's despite now,
King Charles!

Who gave me the goods that went since?
Who raised me the house that sank once?
Who helped me to gold I spent since?
Who found me in wine you drank once?

--King Charles, and who'll do him right now?
      King Charles, and who's ripe for fight now?
      Give a rouse; here's, in hell's despite now,
      King Charles!

To whom used my boy George quaff else,
By the old fool's side that begot him?
For whom did he cheer and laugh else,
While Noll's damned troopers shot him?

--King Charles, and who'll do him right now?
      King Charles, and who's ripe for fight now?
      Give a rouse: here's, in hell's despite now,
      King Charles!

Boot, saddle, to horse, and away!
Rescue my castle before the hot day
Brightens to blue from its silvery gray,

--Boot, saddle, to horse, and away!

Ride past the suburbs, asleep as you'd say;
Many's the friend there, will listen and pray
"God's luck to gallants that strike up the lay--

--Boot, saddle, to horse, and away!"

Forty miles off, like a roebuck at bay,
Flouts castle Brancepeth the Roundheads' array:
Who laughs, "Good fellows ere this, by my fay,

--Boot, saddle, to horse, and away!"

Who? My wife Gertrude; that, honest and gay,
Laughs when you talk of surrendering, "Nay!
I've better counsellors; what counsel they?

-- Boot, saddle, to horse, and away!"
```
