## Winter is good -- his Hoar Delights by Emily Dickinson

```
Winter is good -- his Hoar Delights
Italic flavor yield
To Intellects inebriate
With Summer, or the World --

Generic as a Quarry
And hearty -- as a Rose --
Invited with Asperity
But welcome when he goes.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "Winter is good -- his Hoar Delights" by Emily Dickinson consists of four quatrains, each with four lines. The rhyme scheme is ABCB, with the second and fourth lines in each stanza rhyming. The meter in the poem is predominantly iambic tetrameter, with four metrical feet per line. This consistent structure and rhyme scheme create a sense of order and control in the poem, mirroring the structured nature of winter itself.

### Themes and Imagery

The poem explores the theme of the beauty and value of winter, contrasting it with summer. Winter is personified as a positive force, with "his Hoar Delights" suggesting a sense of pleasure in the frost and cold. The imagery in the poem is vivid and sensory, with words like "hoar," "intellects inebriate," and "asperity" evoking a sense of coldness, intoxication, and harshness. The contrast between winter's harshness and its hidden delights invites readers to reconsider their perceptions of the season.

### Literary Devices

Dickinson employs several literary devices in the poem to enhance its meaning. Personification is used to give winter human qualities, such as delight and asperity. The use of metaphor is also prevalent, with winter being compared to a quarry and a rose, highlighting its generic yet hearty nature. Alliteration is present in phrases like "his Hoar Delights" and "Intellects inebriate," adding a musical quality to the poem. The use of paradox in the final stanza, where winter is described as both invited with asperity and welcome when he goes, creates a sense of complexity and contradiction.

### Historical and Personal Context

Emily Dickinson lived during the 19th century, a time when nature and its changing seasons were often a popular theme in literature. Dickinson's personal life was marked by periods of isolation and introspection, and her poems often reflect her deep connection to nature and her keen observations of the world around her. This poem can be seen as a reflection of Dickinson's own appreciation for the beauty and harshness of winter, as well as a meditation on the cyclical nature of life and seasons.

### Deep Reading

On a deeper level, the poem can be interpreted as a meditation on the duality of winter - its harshness and beauty, its challenges and rewards. The contrast between winter and summer serves as a metaphor for the contrasting experiences in life, with winter representing struggle and growth, and summer representing ease and abundance. The poem suggests that even in the most difficult and challenging times, there is beauty and value to be found. Ultimately, "Winter is good -- his Hoar Delights" encourages readers to embrace the complexities of life and appreciate the hidden delights that can be found even in the coldest of seasons.

## To a Blackbird and His Mate Who Died in the Spring by Joyce Kilmer

```
(For Kenton)

An iron hand has stilled the throats
That throbbed with loud and rhythmic glee
And dammed the flood of silver notes
That drenched the world in melody.
The blosmy apple boughs are yearning
For their wild choristers' returning,
But no swift wings flash through the tree.
Ye that were glad and fleet and strong,
Shall Silence take you in her net?
And shall Death quell that radiant song
Whose echo thrills the meadow yet?
Burst the frail web about you clinging
And charm Death's cruel heart with singing
Till with strange tears his eyes are wet.
The scented morning of the year
Is old and stale now ye are gone.
No friendly songs the children hear
Among the bushes on the lawn.
When babies wander out a-Maying
Will ye, their bards, afar be straying?
Unhymned by you, what is the dawn?
Nay, since ye loved ye cannot die.
Above the stars is set your nest.
Through Heaven's fields ye sing and fly
And in the trees of Heaven rest.
And little children in their dreaming
Shall see your soft black plumage gleaming
And smile, by your clear music blest.
```

## Winter Song by Wilfred Owen

```
The browns, the olives, and the yellows died,
And were swept up to heaven; where they glowed
Each dawn and set of sun till Christmastide,
And when the land lay pale for them, pale-snowed,
Fell back, and down the snow-drifts flamed and flowed.

From off your face, into the winds of winter,
The sun-brown and the summer-gold are blowing;
But they shall gleam with spiritual glinter,
When paler beauty on your brows falls snowing,
And through those snows my looks shall be soft-going.
```
