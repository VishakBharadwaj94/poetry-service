## The Strayed Reveller by Matthew Arnold

```
1 Faster, faster,
2 O Circe, Goddess,
3 Let the wild, thronging train
4 The bright procession
5 Of eddying forms,
6 Sweep through my soul!

7 Thou standest, smiling
8 Down on me! thy right arm,
9 Lean'd up against the column there,
10 Props thy soft cheek;
11 Thy left holds, hanging loosely,
12 The deep cup, ivy-cinctured,
13 I held but now.

14 Is it, then, evening
15 So soon? I see, the night-dews,
16 Cluster'd in thick beads, dim
17 The agate brooch-stones
18 On thy white shoulder;
19 The cool night-wind, too,
20 Blows through the portico,
21 Stirs thy hair, Goddess,
22 Waves thy white robe!

Circe.

23 Whence art thou, sleeper?

The Youth.

24 When the white dawn first
25 Through the rough fir-planks
26 Of my hut, by the chestnuts,
27 Up at the valley-head,
28 Came breaking, Goddess!
29 I sprang up, I threw round me
30 My dappled fawn-skin;
31 Passing out, from the wet turf,
32 Where they lay, by the hut door,
33 I snatch'd up my vine-crown, my fir-staff,
34 All drench'd in dew-
35 Came swift down to join
36 The rout early gather'd
37 In the town, round the temple,
38 Iacchus' white fane
39 On yonder hill.

40 Quick I pass'd, following
41 The wood-cutters' cart-track
42 Down the dark valley;-I saw
43 On my left, through the beeches,
44 Thy palace, Goddess,
45 Smokeless, empty!
46 Trembling, I enter'd; beheld
47 The court all silent,
48 The lions sleeping,
49 On the altar this bowl.
50 I drank, Goddess!
51 And sank down here, sleeping,
52 On the steps of thy portico.

Circe.

53 Foolish boy! Why tremblest thou?
54 Thou lovest it, then, my wine?
55 Wouldst more of it? See, how glows,
56 Through the delicate, flush'd marble,
57 The red, creaming liquor,
58 Strown with dark seeds!
59 Drink, thee! I chide thee not,
60 Deny thee not my bowl.
61 Come, stretch forth thy hand, thee-so!
62 Drink-drink again!

The Youth.

63 Thanks, gracious one!
64 Ah, the sweet fumes again!
65 More soft, ah me,
66 More subtle-winding
67 Than Pan's flute-music!
68 Faint-faint! Ah me,
69 Again the sweet sleep!

Circe.

70 Hist! Thou-within there!
71 Come forth, Ulysses!
72 Art tired with hunting?
73 While we range the woodland,
74 See what the day brings.

Ulysses.

75 Ever new magic!
76 Hast thou then lured hither,
77 Wonderful Goddess, by thy art,
78 The young, languid-eyed Ampelus,
79 Iacchus' darling-
80 Or some youth beloved of Pan,
81 Of Pan and the Nymphs?
82 That he sits, bending downward
83 His white, delicate neck
84 To the ivy-wreathed marge
85 Of thy cup; the bright, glancing vine-leaves
86 That crown his hair,
87 Falling forward, mingling
88 With the dark ivy-plants--
89 His fawn-skin, half untied,
90 Smear'd with red wine-stains? Who is he,
91 That he sits, overweigh'd
92 By fumes of wine and sleep,
93 So late, in thy portico?
94 What youth, Goddess,-what guest
95 Of Gods or mortals?

Circe.

96 Hist! he wakes!
97 I lured him not hither, Ulysses.
98 Nay, ask him!

The Youth.

99 Who speaks' Ah, who comes forth
100 To thy side, Goddess, from within?
101 How shall I name him?
102 This spare, dark-featured,
103 Quick-eyed stranger?
104 Ah, and I see too
105 His sailor's bonnet,
106 His short coat, travel-tarnish'd,
107 With one arm bare!--
108 Art thou not he, whom fame
109 This long time rumours
110 The favour'd guest of Circe, brought by the waves?
111 Art thou he, stranger?
112 The wise Ulysses,
113 Laertes' son?

Ulysses.

114 I am Ulysses.
115 And thou, too, sleeper?
116 Thy voice is sweet.
117 It may be thou hast follow'd
118 Through the islands some divine bard,
119 By age taught many things,
120 Age and the Muses;
121 And heard him delighting
122 The chiefs and people
123 In the banquet, and learn'd his songs.
124 Of Gods and Heroes,
125 Of war and arts,
126 And peopled cities,
127 Inland, or built
128 By the gray sea.-If so, then hail!
129 I honour and welcome thee.

The Youth.

130 The Gods are happy.
131 They turn on all sides
132 Their shining eyes,
133 And see below them
134 The earth and men.

135 They see Tiresias
136 Sitting, staff in hand,
137 On the warm, grassy
138 Asopus bank,
139 His robe drawn over
140 His old sightless head,
141 Revolving inly
142 The doom of Thebes.

143 They see the Centaurs
144 In the upper glens
145 Of Pelion, in the streams,
146 Where red-berried ashes fringe
147 The clear-brown shallow pools,
148 With streaming flanks, and heads
149 Rear'd proudly, snuffing
150 The mountain wind.

151 They see the Indian
152 Drifting, knife in hand,
153 His frail boat moor'd to
154 A floating isle thick-matted
155 With large-leaved, low-creeping melon-plants
156 And the dark cucumber.

157 He reaps, and stows them,
158 Drifting--drifting;--round him,
159 Round his green harvest-plot,
160 Flow the cool lake-waves,
161 The mountains ring them.

162 They see the Scythian
163 On the wide stepp, unharnessing
164 His wheel'd house at noon.
165 He tethers his beast down, and makes his meal--
166 Mares' milk, and bread
167 Baked on the embers;--all around
168 The boundless, waving grass-plains stretch, thick-starr'd
169 With saffron and the yellow hollyhock
170 And flag-leaved iris-flowers.
171 Sitting in his cart
172 He makes his meal; before him, for long miles,
173 Alive with bright green lizards,
174 And the springing bustard-fowl,
175 The track, a straight black line,
176 Furrows the rich soil; here and there
177 Cluster of lonely mounds
178 Topp'd with rough-hewn,
179 Gray, rain-blear'd statues, overpeer
180 The sunny waste.

181 They see the ferry
182 On the broad, clay-laden
183 Lone Chorasmian stream;--thereon,
184 With snort and strain,
185 Two horses, strongly swimming, tow
186 The ferry-boat, with woven ropes
187 To either bow
188 Firm harness'd by the mane; a chief
189 With shout and shaken spear,
190 Stands at the prow, and guides them; but astern
191 The cowering merchants, in long robes,
192 Sit pale beside their wealth
193 Of silk-bales and of balsam-drops,
194 Of gold and ivory,
195 Of turquoise-earth and amethyst,
196 Jasper and chalcedony,
197 And milk-barred onyx-stones.
198 The loaded boat swings groaning
199 In the yellow eddies;
200 The Gods behold him.

201 They see the Heroes
202 Sitting in the dark ship
203 On the foamless, long-heaving
204 Violet sea.
205 At sunset nearing
206 The Happy Islands.

207 These things, Ulysses,
208 The wise bards, also
209 Behold and sing.
210 But oh, what labour!
211 O prince, what pain!
212 They too can see
213 Tiresias;--but the Gods,
214 Who give them vision,
215 Added this law:
216 That they should bear too
217 His groping blindness,
218 His dark foreboding,
219 His scorn'd white hairs;
220 Bear Hera's anger
221 Through a life lengthen'd
222 To seven ages.

223 They see the Centaurs
224 On Pelion:--then they feel,
225 They too, the maddening wine
226 Swell their large veins to bursting; in wild pain
227 They feel the biting spears
228 Of the grim Lapithж, and Theseus, drive,
229 Drive crashing through their bones; they feel
230 High on a jutting rock in the red stream
231 Alcmena's dreadful son
232 Ply his bow;--such a price
233 The Gods exact for song:
234 To become what we sing.

235 They see the Indian
236 On his mountain lake; but squalls
237 Make their skiff reel, and worms
238 In the unkind spring have gnawn
239 Their melon-harvest to the heart.--They see
240 The Scythian: but long frosts
241 Parch them in winter-time on the bare stepp,
242 Till they too fade like grass; they crawl
243 Like shadows forth in spring.

244 They see the merchants
245 On the Oxus stream;--but care
246 Must visit first them too, and make them pale.
247 Whether, through whirling sand,
248 A cloud of desert robber-horse have burst
249 Upon their caravan; or greedy kings,
250 In the wall'd cities the way passes through,
251 Crush'd them with tolls; or fever-airs,
252 On some great river's marge,
253 Mown them down, far from home.

254 They see the Heroes
255 Near harbour;--but they share
256 Their lives, and former violent toil in Thebes,
257 Seven-gated Thebes, or Troy;
258 Or where the echoing oars
259 Of Argo first
260 Startled the unknown sea.

261 The old Silenus
262 Came, lolling in the sunshine,
263 From the dewy forest-coverts,
264 This way at noon.
265 Sitting by me, while his Fauns
266 Down at the water-side
267 Sprinkled and smoothed
268 His drooping garland,
269 He told me these things.

270 But I, Ulysses,
271 Sitting on the warm steps,
272 Looking over the valley,
273 All day long, have seen,
274 Without pain, without labour,
275 Sometimes a wild-hair'd Mжnad--
276 Sometimes a Faun with torches--
277 And sometimes, for a moment,
278 Passing through the dark stems
279 Flowing-robed, the beloved,
280 The desired, the divine,
281 Beloved Iacchus.

282 Ah, cool night-wind, tremulous stars!
283 Ah, glimmering water,
284 Fitful earth-murmur,
285 Dreaming woods!
286 Ah, golden-haired, strangely smiling Goddess,
287 And thou, proved, much enduring,
288 Wave-toss'd Wanderer!
289 Who can stand still?
290 Ye fade, ye swim, ye waver before me--
291 The cup again!

292 Faster, faster,
293 O Circe, Goddess.
294 Let the wild, thronging train,
295 The bright procession
296 Of eddying forms,
297 Sweep through my soul!
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

Matthew Arnold's poem "The Strayed Reveller" consists of a single dramatic monologue between Circe, the Goddess, and two other characters - a youth and Ulysses. The poem is written in free verse with irregular line lengths and no consistent rhyme scheme. This lack of formal structure reflects the stream-of-consciousness style of the speaker, as they recount their experiences and interactions with the divine figures.

The poem's structure mirrors the chaotic and dreamlike nature of the speaker's intoxicated state as they recount their encounters with Circe and Ulysses. The irregularity of the lines and lack of rhyme scheme contribute to the sense of disorientation and unrestrained emotion conveyed throughout the poem.

### Themes and Imagery

One of the central themes of the poem is the allure of indulgence and the consequences of surrendering to temptation. The speaker is drawn into Circe's world of wine and revelry, losing themselves in the sensory pleasures offered by the Goddess. The imagery of wine, sleep, and intoxication symbolizes the seductive power of escapism and the transient nature of pleasure.

The poem also explores the contrast between mortal experiences and the divine realm. The speaker's interactions with Circe and Ulysses blur the boundaries between reality and myth, highlighting the transformative power of storytelling and imagination. The vivid imagery of the Gods, Heroes, and mythical creatures evokes a sense of wonder and enchantment, inviting the reader to contemplate the intersection of the mortal and immortal worlds.

### Literary Devices

Arnold employs various literary devices to enhance the thematic depth and emotional impact of the poem. The use of imagery, such as the description of Circe's palace, the night-wind blowing through the portico, and the sensory details of the wine, creates a rich and immersive atmosphere that transports the reader into the speaker's intoxicated state.

Dialogue is another key literary device used in the poem, as the interactions between the characters drive the narrative forward and reveal their personalities and motivations. The contrast between the youthful innocence of the speaker and the wisdom of Ulysses adds complexity to the themes of temptation and self-discovery explored in the poem.

Arnold also employs symbolism, such as the cup of wine representing indulgence and the night-wind symbolizing change and transition. These symbolic elements deepen the thematic resonance of the poem and invite the reader to engage with its deeper layers of meaning.

### Historical and Personal Context

Matthew Arnold, a prominent Victorian poet and critic, was known for his exploration of themes such as beauty, nature, and the human condition. "The Strayed Reveller" reflects Arnold's interest in Greek mythology and classical literature, as well as his preoccupation with the tension between reason and emotion, duty and desire.

The poem can also be viewed in the context of the Victorian era, a time of social change, industrialization, and moral upheaval. The speaker's struggle with temptation and the allure of the divine figures can be seen as a reflection of the moral dilemmas faced by individuals in a rapidly changing society, where traditional values and beliefs were being challenged.

### Deep Reading

At its core, "The Strayed Reveller" can be interpreted as a meditation on the human experience of longing for transcendence and the pursuit of fleeting pleasures. The speaker's journey from innocence to indulgence to self-awareness mirrors a broader philosophical exploration of the nature of desire, fulfillment, and self-discovery.

Through the character of Ulysses, Arnold introduces the concept of wisdom and self-awareness as essential components of navigating the complexities of life. Ulysses' recognition of the consequences of indulgence serves as a cautionary tale for the speaker, urging them to find balance and moderation in their pursuit of ecstasy and self-discovery.

Ultimately, "The Strayed Reveller" invites the reader to contemplate the intersection of the mortal and divine, the transient nature of pleasure, and the eternal struggle between reason and emotion. Arnold's lyrical exploration of these themes creates a rich tapestry of imagery and emotion that resonates with readers across time and space.

## I Wandered Lonely As A Cloud by William Wordsworth

```
I wandered lonely as a cloud
That floats on high o'er vales and hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
A host, of golden daffodils;
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.

Continuous as the stars that shine
And twinkle on the milky way,
They stretched in never-ending line
Along the margin of a bay:
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.

 The waves beside them danced, but they
Out-did the sparkling leaves in glee;
A poet could not be but gay,
In such a jocund company!
I gazed—and gazed—but little thought
What wealth the show to me had brought:

For oft, when on my couch I lie
In vacant or in pensive mood,
They flash upon that inward eye
Which is the bliss of solitude;
And then my heart with pleasure fills,
And dances with the daffodils.
```

The structured form and meter of the poem mirror the natural beauty and harmony found in the imagery of the daffodils.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem is the beauty and transformative power of nature. The speaker describes a moment of joy and inspiration he experiences upon encountering a field of daffodils. The imagery of the "host of golden daffodils" dancing in the breeze creates a vivid picture of nature's beauty and vitality. The daffodils are portrayed as a source of joy and inspiration, symbolizing the connection between nature and the human spirit. The poem explores the idea of finding solace and happiness in nature, even in moments of solitude or reflection.

### Literary Devices

Wordsworth uses various literary devices to enhance the imagery and emotional impact of the poem. One example is personification, as the daffodils are described as "fluttering and dancing in the breeze" and "tossing their heads in sprightly dance," giving them human-like qualities. The use of simile, such as comparing the daffodils to stars in the Milky Way, adds depth and visual appeal to the description. Wordsworth also employs alliteration, such as in "fluttering and dancing," to create a musical quality in the poem. The repetition of the word "gazed" emphasizes the speaker's intense and prolonged contemplation of the daffodils.

### Historical and Personal Context

William Wordsworth was a key figure in the Romantic literary movement, which emphasized the importance of nature, emotion, and individual experience. The poem reflects Wordsworth's belief in the spiritual and emotional significance of nature in human life. The Romantic poets sought to find beauty and inspiration in the natural world, as a contrast to the industrialization and urbanization of the time. Wordsworth's personal experiences, including his love of the English Lake District where he spent much of his life, influenced his poetry and his focus on nature as a source of creativity and solace.

### Deep Reading

"I Wandered Lonely As A Cloud" can be seen as a meditation on the power of memory and imagination. The speaker recalls the sight of the daffodils not only for their immediate visual beauty but also for the lasting impact they have on his inner life. The image of the daffodils becomes a source of solace and joy, even when the speaker is in a state of solitude or reflection. This suggests that nature has the ability to transcend the present moment and provide a sense of emotional connection and inspiration that endures over time. The poem celebrates the transformative power of nature and the capacity of the human spirit to find solace and beauty in the natural world.

## Father Gerard Hopkins, S. J. by Joyce Kilmer

```
Why didst thou carve thy speech laboriously,
And match and blend thy words with curious art?
For Song, one saith, is but a human heart
Speaking aloud, undisciplined and free.
Nay, God be praised, Who fixed thy task for thee!
Austere, ecstatic craftsman, set apart
From all who traffic in Apollo's mart,
On thy phrased paten shall the Splendour be!
Now, carelessly we throw a rhyme to God,
Singing His praise when other songs are done.
But thou, who knewest paths Teresa trod,
Losing thyself, what is it thou hast won?
O bleeding feet, with peace and glory shod!
O happy moth, that flew into the Sun!
```

### Themes and Imagery

The poem explores themes of artistic craftsmanship, devotion to God, and the sacrifices made in pursuit of spiritual enlightenment. Through imagery such as "Austere, ecstatic craftsman" and "phrased paten," Kilmer portrays Father Gerard Hopkins as a dedicated and disciplined poet who channels divine inspiration into his work. The references to "bleeding feet" and the "happy moth that flew into the Sun" evoke images of suffering and transcendence, symbolizing the journey towards spiritual fulfillment.

### Literary Devices

Kilmer employs various literary devices in the poem, such as alliteration in "match and blend" and "phrased paten," which enhances the musical quality of the verse. The use of paradox in "O bleeding feet, with peace and glory shod" juxtaposes pain and triumph, emphasizing the paradoxical nature of spiritual enlightenment. Additionally, the metaphor of the moth flying into the Sun symbolizes a self-destructive yet transcendent pursuit of divine truth.

### Historical and Personal Context

Joyce Kilmer, a Catholic poet, wrote "Father Gerard Hopkins, S. J." as a tribute to the Jesuit priest and poet Gerard Manley Hopkins. Hopkins was known for his innovative use of language and his deeply spiritual poetry, which often explored themes of nature and God. Kilmer's admiration for Hopkins is evident in the poem, as he celebrates the priest's dedication to his craft and his unwavering faith.

### Deep Reading
