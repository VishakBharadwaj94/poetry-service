## Each Life Converges to some Centre -- by Emily Dickinson

```
Each Life Converges to some Centre --
Expressed -- or still --
Exists in every Human Nature
A Goal --

Embodied scarcely to itself -- it may be --
Too fair
For Credibility's presumption
To mar --

Adored with caution -- as a Brittle Heaven --
To reach
Were hopeless, as the Rainbow's Raiment
To touch --

Yet persevered toward -- sure -- for the Distance --
How high --
Unto the Saint's slow diligence --
The Sky --

Ungained -- it may be -- by a Life's low Venture --
But then --
Eternity enable the endeavoring
Again.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme
Emily Dickinson's poem "Each Life Converges to some Centre --" is written in a traditional ballad stanza form with four-line quatrains. The rhyme scheme is ABCB, where the second and fourth lines rhyme. The poem also follows an alternating iambic tetrameter and trimeter meter, giving it a musical quality. This structured form contrasts with the poem's exploration of life's elusive goals and the human experience of striving towards unattainable ideals.

### Themes and Imagery
The central theme of the poem revolves around the idea of life's pursuit of a central goal or purpose. Dickinson explores the concept that each individual life converges towards a specific endpoint, whether expressed or hidden. The imagery of a "Brittle Heaven" and the impossibility of touching the Rainbow's Raiment convey the elusive nature of these goals, which are often too perfect or distant to be fully realized. The poem suggests that despite the challenges and uncertainties, humans continue to strive towards these unreachable ideals, symbolized by the metaphor of reaching for the sky.

### Literary Devices
Dickinson employs various literary devices to enhance the poem's meaning. The use of paradox is evident in lines such as "Embodied scarcely to itself -- it may be," highlighting the intangible nature of life's central goal. The comparison of this goal to a "Brittle Heaven" and the Rainbow's Raiment creates vivid imagery that emphasizes the fragility and unattainability of these ideals. Additionally, the repetition of the word "unto" in the last stanza adds emphasis to the perseverance and determination required in pursuing these unreachable goals.

### Historical and Personal Context
Emily Dickinson's work often reflects her personal struggles with themes of mortality, faith, and the meaning of life. As a reclusive poet who grappled with questions of existence and spirituality, Dickinson's exploration of life's central purpose in this poem may stem from her own introspective musings. The mid-19th century context of this poem also aligns with the broader intellectual and philosophical currents of the time, marked by a growing fascination with existential questions and the search for meaning in a rapidly changing world.

### Deep Reading
In "Each Life Converges to some Centre --," Dickinson delves into the profound human experience of pursuing elusive goals and striving towards unreachable ideals. The poem's structured form and musical meter provide a sense of order and rhythm, contrasting with the chaotic and uncertain nature of life's central purpose. Through vivid imagery and paradoxical language, Dickinson captures the fleeting and fragile nature of these goals, suggesting that while they may remain unattainable, the pursuit itself holds value and meaning. Ultimately, the poem speaks to the enduring human spirit of perseverance and determination in the face of life's uncertainties and challenges.

## Insensibility by Wilfred Owen

```
I

Happy are men who yet before they are killed
Can let their veins run cold.
Whom no compassion fleers
Or makes their feet
Sore on the alleys cobbled with their brothers.
The front line withers,
But they are troops who fade, not flowers
For poets' tearful fooling:
Men, gaps for filling
Losses who might have fought
Longer; but no one bothers.


    II

And some cease feeling
Even themselves or for themselves.
Dullness best solves
The tease and doubt of shelling,
And Chance's strange arithmetic
Comes simpler than the reckoning of their shilling.
They keep no check on Armies' decimation.


    III

Happy are these who lose imagination:
They have enough to carry with ammunition.
Their spirit drags no pack.
Their old wounds save with cold can not more ache.
Having seen all things red,
Their eyes are rid
Of the hurt of the colour of blood for ever.
And terror's first constriction over,
Their hearts remain small drawn.
Their senses in some scorching cautery of battle
Now long since ironed,
Can laugh among the dying, unconcerned.


    IV

Happy the soldier home, with not a notion
How somewhere, every dawn, some men attack,
And many sighs are drained.
Happy the lad whose mind was never trained:
His days are worth forgetting more than not.
He sings along the march
Which we march taciturn, because of dusk,
The long, forlorn, relentless trend
From larger day to huger night.


    V

We wise, who with a thought besmirch
Blood over all our soul,
How should we see our task
But through his blunt and lashless eyes?
Alive, he is not vital overmuch;
Dying, not mortal overmuch;
Nor sad, nor proud,
Nor curious at all.
He cannot tell
Old men's placidity from his.


    VI

But cursed are dullards whom no cannon stuns,
That they should be as stones.
Wretched are they, and mean
With paucity that never was simplicity.
By choice they made themselves immune
To pity and whatever mourns in man
Before the last sea and the hapless stars;
Whatever mourns when many leave these shores;
Whatever shares
The eternal reciprocity of tears.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

Wilfred Owen's poem "Insensibility" is structured into six distinct sections, each with its own unique focus on the themes of war and its effects on soldiers. The poem does not follow a consistent meter or rhyme scheme, which adds to the sense of disorientation and chaos experienced by the soldiers depicted in the poem. The lack of rhyme also contributes to the overall bleak and somber tone of the poem, mirroring the harsh realities of war. The irregular structure of the poem reflects the fragmented and disjointed experiences of the soldiers on the front lines.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of "Insensibility" revolves around the numbing effects of war on soldiers, both physically and emotionally. Owen explores the idea that in order to survive the horrors of war, soldiers must become insensible to the suffering around them. The poem uses vivid and stark imagery to convey the brutal realities of war, such as the "alleys cobbled with their brothers" and the soldiers who "fade, not flowers" on the front lines. The imagery of blood, wounds, and death creates a sense of desolation and despair, highlighting the dehumanizing nature of war.

### Literary Devices

Owen employs various literary devices throughout the poem to convey the themes of war and insensibility. One notable device is irony, as the title "Insensibility" suggests a lack of sensitivity or feeling, yet the poem delves into the emotional toll that war takes on soldiers. Owen also uses vivid imagery, such as the contrast between the soldiers who "fade, not flowers" and the soldiers who have "seen all things red," to evoke a sense of loss and disillusionment. Additionally, Owen utilizes repetition, such as the repeated use of the word "Happy" in the first and fourth sections, to emphasize the grim reality of war and the numbness it engenders in soldiers.

### Historical and Personal Context

As a soldier who fought in World War I, Wilfred Owen brings a personal and firsthand perspective to his poetry. "Insensibility" reflects Owen's own experiences in the trenches and his observations of how war dehumanizes individuals. The poem was written during a time of great social and political upheaval, as the world grappled with the devastating consequences of global conflict. Owen's poetry serves as a powerful critique of the glorification of war and highlights the futility and senselessness of armed conflict.

### Deep Reading

"Insensibility" delves into the psychological and emotional toll of war, exploring how soldiers must suppress their emotions and desensitize themselves in order to cope with the trauma of battle. The poem challenges traditional notions of heroism and bravery, presenting a stark portrayal of the dehumanizing effects of war on individuals. Owen forces the reader to confront the harsh realities of war and the sacrifices made by soldiers who are forced to endure unimaginable horrors. Through his evocative imagery and poignant language, Owen creates a haunting portrayal of the cost of war on the human spirit.
