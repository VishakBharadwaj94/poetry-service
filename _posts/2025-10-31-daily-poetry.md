## Disabled by Wilfred Owen

```
He sat in a wheeled chair, waiting for dark,
And shivered in his ghastly suit of grey,
Legless, sewn short at elbow.  Through the park
Voices of boys rang saddening like a hymn,
Voices of play and pleasure after day,
Till gathering sleep had mothered them from him.

About this time Town used to swing so gay
When glow-lamps budded in the light-blue trees
And girls glanced lovelier as the air grew dim,
-- In the old times, before he threw away his knees.
Now he will never feel again how slim
Girls' waists are, or how warm their subtle hands,
All of them touch him like some queer disease.

There was an artist silly for his face,
For it was younger than his youth, last year.
Now he is old; his back will never brace;
He's lost his colour very far from here,
Poured it down shell-holes till the veins ran dry,
And half his lifetime lapsed in the hot race,
And leap of purple spurted from his thigh.
One time he liked a bloodsmear down his leg,
After the matches carried shoulder-high.
It was after football, when he'd drunk a peg,
He thought he'd better join.  He wonders why . . .
Someone had said he'd look a god in kilts.

That's why; and maybe, too, to please his Meg,
Aye, that was it, to please the giddy jilts,
He asked to join.  He didn't have to beg;
Smiling they wrote his lie; aged nineteen years.
Germans he scarcely thought of; and no fears
Of Fear came yet.  He thought of jewelled hilts
For daggers in plaid socks; of smart salutes;
And care of arms; and leave; and pay arrears;
Esprit de corps; and hints for young recruits.
And soon, he was drafted out with drums and cheers.

Some cheered him home, but not as crowds cheer Goal.
Only a solemn man who brought him fruits
Thanked him; and then inquired about his soul.
Now, he will spend a few sick years in Institutes,
And do what things the rules consider wise,
And take whatever pity they may dole.
To-night he noticed how the women's eyes
Passed from him to the strong men that were whole.
How cold and late it is!  Why don't they come
And put him into bed?  Why don't they come?
```

## Evelyn Hope by Robert Browning

```
Beautiful Evelyn Hope is dead!
  Sit and watch by her side an hour.
That is her book-shelf, this her bed;
  She plucked that piece of geranium-flower,
Beginning to die too, in the glass;
  Little has yet been changed, I think:
The shutters are shut, no light may pass
  Save two long rays thro' the hinge's chink.

Sixteen years old when she died!
  Perhaps she had scarcely heard my name;
It was not her time to love; beside,
  Her life had many a hope and aim,
Duties enough and little cares,
  And now was quiet, now astir,
Till God's hand beckoned unawares,--
  And the sweet white brow is all of her.

Is it too late then, Evelyn Hope?
  What, your soul was pure and true,
The good stars met in your horoscope,
  Made you of spirit, fire and dew--
And just because I was thrice as old
  And our paths in the world diverged so wide,
Each was naught to each, must I be told?
  We were fellow mortals, naught beside?

No, indeed! for God above
  Is great to grant, as mighty to make,
And creates the love to reward the love:
  I claim you still, for my own love's sake!
Delayed it may be for more lives yet,
  Thro' worlds I shall traverse, not a few:
Much is to learn, much, to forget
  Ere the time be come for taking you.

But the time will come, at last it will,
  When, Evelyn Hope, what meant (I shall say)
In the lower earth in the years long still,
  That body and soul so pure and gay?
Why your hair was amber, I shall divine,
  And your mouth of your own geranium's red--
And what would you do with me, in fine,
  In the new life come in the old one's stead.

I have lived (I shall say) so much since then,
  Given up myself so many times,
Gained me the gains of various men,
  Ransacked the ages, spoiled the climes;
Yet one thing, one, in my soul's full scope,
  Either I missed or itself missed me:
And I want and find you, Evelyn Hope!
  What is the issue? let us see!

I loved you, Evelyn, all the while!
  My heart seemed full as it could hold;
There was place and to spare for the frank young smile,
  And the red young mouth, and the hair's young gold.
So hush,--I will give you this leaf to keep:
  See, I shut it inside the sweet cold hand!
There, that is our secret: go to sleep!
  You will wake, and remember, and understand.
```

## Love and Friendship by Emily Bronte

```
Love is like the wild rose-briar,
Friendship like the holly-tree --
The holly is dark when the rose-briar blooms
But which will bloom most contantly?
The wild-rose briar is sweet in the spring,
Its summer blossoms scent the air;
Yet wait till winter comes again
And who wil call the wild-briar fair?
Then scorn the silly rose-wreath now
And deck thee with the holly's sheen,
That when December blights thy brow
He may still leave thy garland green.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

In terms of form, Emily Bronte's poem "Love and Friendship" consists of four quatrains, with each stanza following an ABAB rhyme scheme. The poem is written in iambic tetrameter, with each line containing four metrical feet. This consistent structure and meter give the poem a balanced and rhythmic flow, enhancing the poetic impact of the contrast between love and friendship.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem revolves around the contrasting nature of love and friendship. Bronte uses the imagery of the wild rose-briar and the holly-tree to vividly illustrate this dichotomy. Love, represented by the wild rose-briar, is depicted as sweet and beautiful in its initial stages, much like the blooming flowers in spring. However, Bronte suggests that love can fade and lose its allure over time, just as the wild-briar loses its beauty in winter. Friendship, on the other hand, symbolized by the holly-tree, is portrayed as enduring and steadfast, remaining constant even in the face of adversity. The imagery of the holly's evergreen leaves serves as a powerful metaphor for the lasting nature of true friendship.

### Literary Devices

Bronte employs various literary devices to enhance the thematic depth of the poem. One such device is personification, as she attributes human-like qualities to the rose-briar and the holly-tree, portraying them as symbols of love and friendship, respectively. Additionally, the use of contrast and imagery helps to underscore the differences between love and friendship, emphasizing the transient nature of love and the enduring quality of friendship. The poet also uses symbolism, with the rose-briar representing the fleeting nature of romantic love, while the holly-tree symbolizes the lasting bond of friendship.

### Historical and Personal Context

Emily Bronte wrote "Love and Friendship" during the 19th century, a time when societal norms placed a strong emphasis on the importance of romantic love. However, Bronte challenges this conventional view by highlighting the enduring value of friendship in the face of changing circumstances. Given Bronte's own experiences of loss and isolation, it is possible to interpret the poem as a reflection of her personal struggles and the significance she attributed to enduring companionship over fleeting romance.

### Deep Reading

At its core, "Love and Friendship" serves as a poignant meditation on the transient nature of love and the enduring strength of friendship. By juxtaposing the ephemeral beauty of the wild rose-briar with the steadfastness of the holly-tree, Bronte invites readers to reflect on the true essence of lasting relationships. The poem encourages us to prioritize the bonds of friendship, which can weather the storms of life and remain evergreen, even in the bleakest of times. Through its evocative imagery and thought-provoking themes, "Love and Friendship" offers a profound exploration of the complexities of human relationships and the enduring power of true companionship.
