## Tears by Edward Thomas

```
IT seems I have no tears left. They should have fallen--
Their ghosts, if tears have ghosts, did fall--that day
When twenty hounds streamed by me, not yet combed
   out
But still all equals in their rage of gladness
Upon the scent, made one, like a great dragon
In Blooming Meadow that bends towards the sun
And once bore hops: and on that other day
When I stepped out from the double-shadowed Tower
Into an April morning, stirring and sweet
And warm. Strange solitude was there and silence.
A mightier charm than any in the Tower
Possessed the courtyard. They were changing guard
Soldiers in line, young English countrymen,
Fair-haired and ruddy, in white tunics. Drums
And fifes were playing "The British Grenadiers".
The men, the music piercing that solitude
And silence, told me truths I had not dreamed
And have forgotten since their beauty passed.
```

## The Night Journey by Rupert Brooke

```
Hands and lit faces eddy to a line;
The dazed last minutes click; the clamour dies.
Beyond the great-swung arc o' the roof, divine,
Night, smoky-scarv'd, with thousand coloured eyes

Glares the imperious mystery of the way.
Thirsty for dark, you feel the long-limbed train
Throb, stretch, thrill motion, slide, pull out and sway,
Strain for the far, pause, draw to strength again. . . .

As a man, caught by some great hour, will rise,
Slow-limbed, to meet the light or find his love;
And, breathing long, with staring sightless eyes,
Hands out, head back, agape and silent, move

Sure as a flood, smooth as a vast wind blowing;
And, gathering power and purpose as he goes,
Unstumbling, unreluctant, strong, unknowing,
Borne by a will not his, that lifts, that grows,

Sweep out to darkness, triumphing in his goal,
Out of the fire, out of the little room. . . .
-- There is an end appointed, O my soul!
Crimson and green the signals burn; the gloom

Is hung with steam's far-blowing livid streamers.
Lost into God, as lights in light, we fly,
Grown one with will, end-drunken huddled dreamers.
The white lights roar. The sounds of the world die.

And lips and laughter are forgotten things.
Speed sharpens; grows. Into the night, and on,
The strength and splendour of our purpose swings.
The lamps fade; and the stars. We are alone.
```

## Count Gismond by Robert Browning

```
Christ God who savest man, save most
        Of men Count Gismond who saved me!
Count Gauthier, when he chose his post,
        Chose time and place and company
To suit it; when he struck at length
My honour, 'twas with all his strength.

And doubtlessly ere he could draw
        All points to one, he must have schemed!
That miserable morning saw
        Few half so happy as I seemed,
While being dressed in queen's array
To give our tourney prize away.

I thought they loved me, did me grace
        To please themselves; 'twas all their deed;
God makes, or fair or foul, our face;
        If showing mine so caused to bleed
My cousins' hearts, they should have dropped
A word, and straight the play had stopped.

They, too, so beauteous!  Each a queen
        By virtue of her brow and breast;
Not needing to be crowned, I mean,
        As I do.  E'en when I was dressed,
Had either of them spoke, instead
Of glancing sideways with still head!

But no: they let me laugh, and sing
        My birthday song quite through, adjust
The last rose in my garland, fling
        A last look on the mirror, trust
My arms to each an arm of theirs,
And so descend the castle-stairs--

And come out on the morning-troop
        Of merry friends who kissed my cheek,
And called me queen, and made me stoop
        Under the canopy--a streak
That pierced it, of the outside sun,
Powdered with gold its gloom's soft dun--

And they could let me take my state
        And foolish throne amid applause
Of all come there to celebrate
        My queen's-day--Oh I think the cause
Of much was, they forgot no crowd
Makes up for parents in their shroud!

However that be, all eyes were bent
        Upon me, when my cousins cast
Theirs down; 'twas time I should present
        The victor's crown, but... there, 'twill last
No long time... the old mist again
Blinds me as then it did. How vain!

See!  Gismond's at the gate, in talk
        With his two boys: I can proceed.
Well, at that moment, who should stalk
        Forth boldly--to my face, indeed--
But Gauthier, and he thundered "Stay!"
And all stayed.  "Bring no crowns, I say!"

"Bring torches! Wind the penance-sheet
        About her!  Let her shun the chaste,
Or lay herself before their feet!
        Shall she whose body I embraced
A night long, queen it in the day?
For honour's sake no crowns, I say!"

I?  What I answered?  As I live,
        I never fancied such a thing
As answer possible to give.
        What says the body when they spring
Some monstrous torture-engine's whole
Strength on it?  No more says the soul.

Till out strode Gismond; then I knew
        That I was saved. I never met
His face before, but, at first view,
        I felt quite sure that God had set
Himself to Satan; who would spend
A minute's mistrust on the end?

He strode to Gauthier, in his throat
        Gave him the lie, then struck his mouth
With one back-handed blow that wrote
        In blood men's verdict there.  North, South,
East, West, I looked. The lie was dead,
And damned, and truth stood up instead.

This glads me most, that I enjoyed
        The heart of the joy, with my content
In watching Gismond unalloyed
        By any doubt of the event:
God took that on him--I was bid
Watch Gismond for my part: I did.

Did I not watch him while he let
        His armourer just brace his greaves,
Rivet his hauberk, on the fret
        The while!  His foot... my memory leaves
No least stamp out, nor how anon
He pulled his ringing gauntlets on.

And e'en before the trumpet's sound
        Was finished, prone lay the false knight,
Prone as his lie, upon the ground:
        Gismond flew at him, used no sleight
O' the sword, but open-breasted drove,
Cleaving till out the truth he clove.

Which done, he dragged him to my feet
        And said "Here die, but end thy breath
In full confession, lest thou fleet
        From my first, to God's second death!
Say, hast thou lied?"  And, "I have lied
To God and her," he said, and died.

Then Gismond, kneeling to me, asked
        What safe my heart holds, though no word
Could I repeat now, if I tasked
        My powers for ever, to a third
Dear even as you are.  Pass the rest
Until I sank upon his breast.

Over my head his arm he flung
        Against the world; and scarce I felt
His sword (that dripped by me and swung)
        A little shifted in its belt:
For he began to say the while
How South our home lay many a mile.

So 'mid the shouting multitude
        We two walked forth to never more
Return.  My cousins have pursued
        Their life, untroubled as before
I vexed them.  Gauthier's dwelling-place
God lighten!  May his soul find grace!

Our elder boy has got the clear
        Great brow; tho' when his brother's black
Full eye shows scorn, it... Gismond here?
        And have you brought my tercel back?
I just was telling Adela
How many birds it struck since May.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

Robert Browning's poem "Count Gismond" is written in the form of a dramatic monologue, where the speaker recounts a specific event in their life. The poem consists of 120 lines divided into six stanzas of varying lengths. The structure of the poem is not rigid, allowing Browning to explore the speaker's emotions and thoughts in a natural, conversational manner.

In terms of meter, the poem does not strictly adhere to a specific pattern. However, there are moments of iambic rhythm, where unstressed syllables are followed by stressed ones, creating a sense of flow and natural speech.

The rhyme scheme in the poem is irregular, with alternating end rhymes scattered throughout the stanzas. This lack of a consistent rhyme scheme adds to the conversational tone of the poem, making it feel more like a personal reflection rather than a structured piece of poetry.

### Themes and Imagery

One of the central themes of the poem is the idea of honor and justice. The speaker narrates a moment where Count Gismond intervenes to protect their honor and expose the lies of Count Gauthier. This theme is reinforced through imagery of medieval courtly life, with references to knights, tournaments, and chivalry.

Imagery plays a significant role in the poem, painting vivid pictures of the events unfolding. The descriptions of the speaker being dressed in queen's attire, the arrival of Count Gismond, and the confrontation between Gismond and Gauthier all contribute to the atmospheric setting of the poem. Browning uses imagery to evoke a sense of tension, drama, and resolution in the narrative.

### Literary Devices

Browning employs several literary devices throughout the poem to enhance its impact. One prominent device is alliteration, seen in lines such as "He strode to Gauthier, in his throat" and "God took that on him--I was bid." The repetition of consonant sounds creates a sense of rhythm and emphasis in these lines.

Another device Browning uses is symbolism, particularly in the characters of Count Gismond and Count Gauthier. Gismond represents truth, honor, and justice, while Gauthier symbolizes deceit and betrayal. Through these characters, Browning explores complex moral themes and the consequences of one's actions.

### Historical and Personal Context

"Count Gismond" was written by Robert Browning in the 19th century, a time marked by social and political upheaval. Browning's exploration of themes such as honor, justice, and truth reflects the moral complexities of his era. The poem also showcases Browning's interest in psychology and human behavior, as seen in the speaker's introspective narrative.

The historical context of the poem likely draws inspiration from medieval chivalric traditions, where honor and loyalty were paramount values. Browning's choice to set the poem in a medieval-like setting adds depth to the narrative and allows for a rich exploration of moral dilemmas and ethical choices.

### Deep Reading

On a deeper level, "Count Gismond" can be seen as a reflection on the nature of truth and the consequences of deception. The speaker's experience of being betrayed by Count Gauthier and subsequently saved by Count Gismond highlights the importance of integrity and righteousness in a world filled with deceit.

The poem's resolution, with Gismond exposing Gauthier's lies and upholding the speaker's honor, reinforces the idea that truth will always prevail in the end. Through the character of Gismond, Browning presents a moral compass, a figure who embodies justice and virtue in the face of moral ambiguity.
