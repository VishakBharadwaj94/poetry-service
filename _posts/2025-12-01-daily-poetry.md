## I Wandered Lonely As A Cloud by William Wordsworth

```
I wandered lonely as a cloud
That floats on high o'er vales and hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
A host, of golden daffodils;
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.

Continuous as the stars that shine
And twinkle on the milky way,
They stretched in never-ending line
Along the margin of a bay:
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.

 The waves beside them danced, but they
Out-did the sparkling leaves in glee;
A poet could not be but gay,
In such a jocund company!
I gazed—and gazed—but little thought
What wealth the show to me had brought:

For oft, when on my couch I lie
In vacant or in pensive mood,
They flash upon that inward eye
Which is the bliss of solitude;
And then my heart with pleasure fills,
And dances with the daffodils.
```

The rhyme scheme is ABABCC, with alternating rhymes in the first four lines and a rhyming couplet to conclude each stanza.

### Themes and Imagery

The comparison of the daffodils to stars in the sky and the waves in the bay highlights their abundance and brilliance. The poet's experience of solitude and reflection in nature is depicted as a source of inspiration and happiness.

### Literary Devices

Wordsworth employs several literary devices in the poem to enhance its impact. One notable device is personification, as the daffodils are described as "tossing their heads in sprightly dance" and outdoing the sparkling leaves in glee. This personification gives the daffodils a sense of vitality and liveliness. The repeated use of similes, such as comparing the daffodils to stars and clouds, creates vivid and striking imagery that captures the essence of nature's beauty.

### Historical and Personal Context

William Wordsworth was a key figure in the Romantic literary movement, which emphasized the importance of nature, emotion, and individual experience. This poem reflects Wordsworth's belief in the spiritual and emotional connection between humanity and the natural world. The poem was inspired by an actual event in Wordsworth's life when he saw a field of daffodils while walking with his sister Dorothy. This personal experience adds depth and authenticity to the poem's portrayal of nature's transformative power.

### Deep Reading

On a deeper level, "I Wandered Lonely As A Cloud" can be seen as a meditation on the role of memory and imagination in shaping our experience of the world. The daffodils become a symbol of both the fleeting beauty of nature and the enduring power of memory. The poet's ability to recall the scene and find solace in it during moments of solitude underscores the lasting impact of the natural world on the human psyche. The poem invites readers to reflect on the transcendent moments in life that stay with us and bring us joy even in times of hardship.

## The Word by Edward Thomas

```
THERE are so many things I have forgot,
That once were much to me, or that were not,
All lost, as is a childless woman's child
And its child's children, in the undefiled
Abyss of what can never be again.
I have forgot, too, names of the mighty men
That fought and lost or won in the old wars,
Of kings and fiends and gods, and most of the stars.
Some things I have forgot that I forget.
But lesser things there are, remembered yet,
Than all the others. One name that I have not--
Though 'tis an empty thingless name--forgot
Never can die because Spring after Spring
Some thrushes learn to say it as they sing.
There is always one at midday saying it clear
And tart--the name, only the name I hear.
While perhaps I am thinking of the elder scent
That is like food, or while I am content
With the wild rose scent that is like memory,
This name suddenly is cried out to me
From somewhere in the bushes by a bird
Over and over again, a pure thrush word.
```

The image of the thrushes singing the name that the poet has forgotten symbolizes the cyclical nature of memory and the enduring power of certain words or names.

### Literary Devices

Thomas uses various literary devices to enhance the poem's impact. One notable device is personification, where he describes forgotten names as if they have a life of their own, suggesting that they can never truly die. The use of imagery, such as the scent of elder or wild rose, adds layers of sensory detail to the poem, creating a rich tapestry of memories and emotions. The repetition of the word "forgot" emphasizes the theme of forgetfulness and reinforces the poet's contemplation on memory and loss.

Through its introspective tone and poignant imagery, the poem invites readers to contemplate the fleeting nature of memory and the timeless resonance of certain words or names.

## Beauty and Beauty by Rupert Brooke

```
When Beauty and Beauty meet
All naked, fair to fair,
The earth is crying-sweet,
And scattering-bright the air,
Eddying, dizzying, closing round,
With soft and drunken laughter;
Veiling all that may befall
After -- after --

Where Beauty and Beauty met,
Earth's still a-tremble there,
And winds are scented yet,
And memory-soft the air,
Bosoming, folding glints of light,
And shreds of shadowy laughter;
Not the tears that fill the years
After -- after --
```
