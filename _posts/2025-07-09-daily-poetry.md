## The New School by Joyce Kilmer

```
(For My Mother)

The halls that were loud with the merry tread of
young and careless feet
Are still with a stillness that is too drear to seem like holiday,
And never a gust of laughter breaks the calm of the dreaming street
Or rises to shake the ivied walls and frighten the doves away.
The dust is on book and on empty desk, and the
tennis-racquet and balls
Lie still in their lonely locker and wait for a game that is never
played,
And over the study and lecture-room and the river and meadow falls
A stern peace, a strange peace, a peace that War has made.
For many a youthful shoulder now is gay with an
epaulet,
And the hand that was deft with a cricket-bat is defter with a sword,
And some of the lads will laugh to-day where the trench is red and
wet,
And some will win on the bloody field the accolade of the Lord.
They have taken their youth and mirth away
from the study and playing-ground
To a new school in an alien land beneath an alien sky;
Out in the smoke and roar of the fight their lessons and games are
found,
And they who were learning how to live are learning how to die.
And after the golden day has come and the war is
at an end,
A slab of bronze on the chapel wall will tell of the noble dead.
And every name on that radiant list will be the name of a friend,
A name that shall through the centuries in grateful prayers be said.
And there will be ghosts in the old school,
brave ghosts with laughing eyes,
On the field with a ghostly cricket-bat, by the stream with a ghostly
rod;
They will touch the hearts of the living with a flame that sanctifies,
A flame that they took with strong young hands
from the altar-fires of God.

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme
In terms of form, "The New School" by Joyce Kilmer is a free verse poem, lacking a consistent rhyme scheme or meter. The lack of a strict structure mirrors the chaos and disruption caused by war, which is a central theme of the poem. The irregularity in the poem's form reflects the uncertainty and upheaval experienced by the young men who have left their school to fight in a war.

### Themes and Imagery
The central theme of the poem is the impact of war on a school community. Kilmer vividly describes the once lively halls and playing grounds that have now been abandoned by the students, who have gone off to fight. The contrast between the past joy and current stillness highlights the profound changes brought about by war. The imagery of dust on books and deserted lockers conveys a sense of loss and absence, while the mention of a slab of bronze on the chapel wall memorializing the fallen soldiers emphasizes the theme of sacrifice and remembrance.

### Literary Devices
Kilmer employs various literary devices to convey the poem's themes effectively. Personification is used when describing the halls as being "loud with the merry tread" and the stillness as "drear." These personifications help to create a vivid picture of the deserted school. The use of symbolism is evident in the contrast between the cricket-bat and the sword, representing the shift from playful innocence to the harsh reality of war. Additionally, the repetition of the word "peace" throughout the poem serves to emphasize the irony of a peace brought about by war.

### Historical and Personal Context
Written during World War I, "The New School" reflects the widespread impact of the conflict on communities and individuals. Kilmer himself served in the war and was killed in action, lending a personal connection to the themes of sacrifice and loss in the poem. The poem captures the sentiment of the time when young men left their schools and families to fight in a war that forever changed their lives and the world around them.

### Deep Reading
At its core, "The New School" is a poignant reflection on the transformation of youth into soldiers, and the toll that war takes on individuals and communities. The ghosts of the fallen soldiers haunting the old school symbolize the enduring impact of their sacrifice, their memories serving as a source of inspiration and reverence for future generations. Kilmer's portrayal of the young soldiers learning how to die rather than how to live underscores the brutal reality of war and the profound loss experienced by those left behind. Overall, the poem serves as a powerful tribute to the bravery and sacrifice of those who gave their lives in service of their country.

## I Wandered Lonely As A Cloud by William Wordsworth

```
I wandered lonely as a cloud
That floats on high o'er vales and hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
A host, of golden daffodils;
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.

Continuous as the stars that shine
And twinkle on the milky way,
They stretched in never-ending line
Along the margin of a bay:
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.

 The waves beside them danced, but they
Out-did the sparkling leaves in glee;
A poet could not be but gay,
In such a jocund company!
I gazed—and gazed—but little thought
What wealth the show to me had brought:

For oft, when on my couch I lie
In vacant or in pensive mood,
They flash upon that inward eye
Which is the bliss of solitude;
And then my heart with pleasure fills,
And dances with the daffodils.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

In "I Wandered Lonely As A Cloud," William Wordsworth uses a traditional form of poetry called a lyric poem. The poem consists of four six-line stanzas with a rhyme scheme of ABABCC. This structure creates a sense of musicality and harmony, mirroring the peaceful and serene tone of the poem. 

The meter of the poem is iambic tetrameter, with each line having eight syllables and following a pattern of unstressed syllable followed by a stressed syllable. This regular meter adds to the rhythmic flow of the poem and contributes to its lyrical quality.

Wordsworth also employs enjambment in the poem, where lines flow into each other without a pause, creating a sense of continuous movement and reflecting the wandering nature of the speaker's thoughts.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem is the beauty of nature and its ability to evoke joy and inspiration in the human heart. The speaker describes a field of golden daffodils that captivate his attention and bring him a sense of bliss. The imagery of the daffodils "fluttering and dancing in the breeze" creates a vivid picture of nature in its full glory, inviting the reader to share in the speaker's awe and wonder.

The imagery of the daffodils as a "host, of golden daffodils" and "Ten thousand saw I at a glance" emphasizes the abundance and richness of nature, highlighting its capacity to overwhelm the senses and uplift the spirit.

### Literary Devices

Wordsworth employs several literary devices in the poem to enhance its meaning and impact. One such device is personification, where the daffodils are described as "tossing their heads in sprightly dance," giving them human-like qualities and making them come alive in the reader's imagination.

The simile "I wandered lonely as a cloud" compares the speaker's solitary state to that of a cloud drifting aimlessly, creating a sense of isolation and detachment that is later contrasted with the joyous encounter with the daffodils.

The use of imagery, such as the comparison of the daffodils to stars and the waves dancing beside them, adds depth and richness to the poem, inviting readers to experience the beauty of nature through vivid sensory details.

### Historical and Personal Context

It is a quintessential Romantic poem, reflecting the Romantic ideals of celebrating nature, emotion, and imagination. Wordsworth was a key figure in the Romantic movement, which emphasized individual experience, intuition, and the sublime beauty of the natural world.

The poem also reflects Wordsworth's personal philosophy of nature as a source of spiritual and emotional nourishment. Wordsworth believed that nature had the power to inspire and uplift the human spirit, and this belief is evident in the profound connection the speaker feels with the daffodils in the poem.

### Deep Reading

At its core, "I Wandered Lonely As A Cloud" is a poem about the transformative power of nature and the capacity of beauty to bring joy and solace to the human soul. The speaker's initial sense of loneliness and detachment is replaced by a profound connection with the natural world, symbolized by the dancing daffodils. The daffodils become a source of spiritual nourishment and inspiration, filling the speaker's heart with pleasure and prompting a dance of joy within him.

The poem also speaks to the enduring impact of nature on the human psyche, as the memory of the daffodils continues to bring comfort and happiness to the speaker even in moments of solitude. This suggests that nature has the ability to transcend time and space, offering a timeless source of solace and beauty to those who seek it.
