## "Home" by Edward Thomas

```
FAIR was the morning, fair our tempers, and
We had seen nothing fairer than that land,
Though strange, and the untrodden snow that made
Wild of the tame, casting out all that was
Not wild and rustic and old; and we were glad.

Fair, too, was afternoon, and first to pass
Were we that league of snow, next the north wind

There was nothing to return for, except need,
And yet we sang nor ever stopped for speed,
As we did often with the start behind.
Faster still strode we when we came in sight
Of the cold roofs where we must spend the night.
Happy we had not been there, nor could be.
Though we had tasted sleep and food and fellowship
Together long.

               "How quick" to someone's lip
The words came, "will the beaten horse run home."

The word "home" raised a smile in us all three,
And one repeated it, smiling just so
That all knew what he meant and none would say.
Between three counties far apart that lay
We were divided and looked strangely each
At the other, and we knew we were not friends
But fellows in a union that ends
With the necessity for it, as it ought.

Never a word was spoken, not a thought
Was thought, of what the look meant with the word
"Home" as we walked and watched the sunset blurred.
And then to me the word, only the word,
"Homesick," as it were playfully occurred:
No more.

          If I should ever more admit
Than the mere word I could not endure it
For a day longer: this captivity
Must somehow come to an end, else I should be
Another man, as often now I seem,
Or this life be only an evil dream.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

This lack of formal structure reflects the natural flow of thoughts and emotions in the speaker's mind as he contemplates the concept of home. The poem is divided into three stanzas, each exploring different aspects of the theme. The first stanza describes the beauty of the landscape, the second stanza delves into the idea of home and fellowship, and the third stanza reveals the speaker's inner turmoil about feeling homesick.

The contrast between the wild and the tame, the old and the new, reflects the speaker's internal conflict about the concept of home and belonging. The cold roofs where they must spend the night symbolize the temporary nature of their fellowship and the distance between them.

### Literary Devices
Thomas employs several literary devices in the poem, such as imagery, symbolism, and repetition. The imagery of the untrodden snow and the cold roofs conveys a sense of isolation and transience. The repetition of the word "home" emphasizes its significance and the speaker's conflicting emotions towards it. The use of enjambment and caesura creates a flowing and reflective tone, allowing the reader to pause and contemplate the meaning behind the words.

### Deep Reading

## A Pæan by Edgar Allan Poe

```
How shall the burial rite be read?
  The solemn song be sung?
The requiem for the loveliest dead,
  That ever died so young?

Her friends are gazing on her,
  And on her gaudy bier,
And weep!--oh! to dishonor
  Dead beauty with a tear!

They loved her for her wealth--
  And they hated her for her pride--
But she grew in feeble health,
  And they _love_ her--that she died.

They tell me (while they speak
  Of her "costly broider'd pall")
That my voice is growing weak--
  That I should not sing at all--

Or that my tone should be
  Tun'd to such solemn song
So mournfully--so mournfully,
  That the dead may feel no wrong.

But she is gone above,
  With young Hope at her side,
And I am drunk with love
  Of the dead, who is my bride.--

Of the dead--dead who lies
  All perfum'd there,
With the death upon her eyes.
  And the life upon her hair.

Thus on the coffin loud and long
  I strike--the murmur sent
Through the gray chambers to my song,
  Shall be the accompaniment.

Thou diedst in thy life's June--
  But thou didst not die too fair:
Thou didst not die too soon,
  Nor with too calm an air.

From more than friends on earth,
  Thy life and love are riven,
To join the untainted mirth
  Of more than thrones in heaven.--

Therefore, to thee this night
  I will no requiem raise,
But waft thee on thy flight,
  With a Pæan of old days.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "A Pæan" by Edgar Allan Poe is structured as a lyrical elegy, mourning the death of a young woman. It consists of six stanzas, each with a varying number of lines. The rhyme scheme is irregular, with Poe using rhyme to create a musical quality rather than following a strict pattern. For example, in the first stanza, the rhyme scheme is ABAB, while in the second stanza, it changes to AABB. This irregularity adds to the mournful and erratic tone of the poem. The meter is also varied, with Poe using a mix of iambs and trochees to create a rhythmic flow that mirrors the emotional turmoil of the speaker.

### Themes and Imagery

The central themes of the poem revolve around death, mourning, and love. The speaker grapples with conflicting emotions towards the deceased young woman, acknowledging the superficiality of her friends' love for her while expressing his own deep and unending love for her. Imagery of death and beauty is prevalent throughout the poem, with descriptions of the dead woman as having "the death upon her eyes" and "the life upon her hair." This juxtaposition of life and death serves to highlight the complex emotions surrounding the loss of a loved one.

### Literary Devices

Poe employs several literary devices in "A Pæan" to enhance the emotional impact of the poem. One notable device is the use of repetition, particularly in the lines "That ever died so young?" and "so mournfully--so mournfully." This repetition emphasizes the speaker's lamentation and adds a sense of urgency to the poem. Additionally, Poe uses alliteration in phrases like "perfum'd there" and "life's June," creating a musical quality that enhances the poem's mournful tone.

### Historical and Personal Context

Edgar Allan Poe's personal life was marked by tragedy and loss, which is reflected in much of his work. Poe lost many loved ones throughout his life, including his mother and wife, and these experiences likely influenced his exploration of themes of death and mourning in his poetry. Additionally, the Victorian era in which Poe lived was characterized by a fascination with death and mourning rituals, which is evident in the somber and melancholic tone of "A Pæan."

### Deep Reading

In "A Pæan," Poe delves into the complexities of grief and love, portraying the speaker's conflicted feelings towards the deceased young woman. The speaker's intense love for the dead woman is juxtaposed with the superficiality of her friends' affections, highlighting the speaker's isolation in his grief. The use of the word "Pæan" in the title, which traditionally refers to a hymn of praise or triumph, adds a layer of irony to the poem, as the speaker praises the dead woman in a funeral elegy. Ultimately, "A Pæan" explores the enduring nature of love and the pain of loss in a poignant and haunting manner.
