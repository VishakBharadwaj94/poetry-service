## The Heretic's Tragedy: A Middle-Age Interlude by Robert Browning

```
The Lord, we look to once for all,
        Is the Lord we should look at, all at once:
He knows not to vary, saith Saint Paul,
        Nor the shadow of turning, for the nonce.
See him no other than as he is!
        Give both the infinitudes their due--
Infinite mercy, but, I wis,
        As infinite a justice too.

As infinite a justice too.

John, Master of the Temple of God,
        Falling to sin the Unknown Sin,
What he bought of Emperor Aldabrod,
        He sold it to Sultan Saladin:
Till, caught by Pope Clement, a-buzzing there,
        Hornet-prince of the mad wasps' hive,
And clipt of his wings in Paris square,
        They bring him now to be burned alive.
                        [And wanteth there grace of lute or
                                clavicithern, ye shall say to
                                confirm him who singeth--
        We bring John now to be burned alive.

In the midst is a goodly gallows built;
        'Twixt fork and fork, a stake is stuck;
But first they set divers tumbrils a-tilt,
        Make a trench all round with the city muck;
Inside they pile log upon log, good store;
        Faggots no few, blocks great and small,
Reach a man's mid-thigh, no less, no more,--
        For they mean he should roast in the sight of all.

        We mean he should roast in the sight of all.

Good sappy bavins that kindle forthwith;
        Billets that blaze substantial and slow;
Pine-stump split deftly, dry as pith;
        Larch-heart that chars to a chalk-white glow:
They up they hoist me John in a chafe,
        Sling him fast like a hog to scorch,
Spit in his face, then leap back safe,
Sing "Laudes" and bid clap-to the torch.

        Laus deo--who bids clap-to the torch.

John of the Temple, whose fame so bragged,
        Is burning alive in Paris square!
How can he curse, if his mouth is gagged?
        Or wriggle his neck, with a collar there?
Or heave his chest, which a band goes round?
        Or threat with his fist, since his arms are spliced?
Or kick with his feet, now his legs are bound?
        --Thinks John, I will call upon Jesus Christ.

Jesus Christ--John had bought and sold,
        Jesus Christ--John had eaten and drunk;
To him, the Flesh meant silver and gold.
        (Salva reverentia.)
Now it was, "Saviour, bountiful lamb,
        "I have roasted thee Turks, though men roast me!
"See thy servant, the plight wherein I am!
        "Art thou a saviour? Save thou me!"

       'Tis John the mocker cries, "Save thou me!"

Who maketh God's menace an idle word?
        --Saith, it no more means what it proclaims,
Than a damsel's threat to her wanton bird?
        For she too prattles of ugly names.
--Saith, he knoweth but one thing--what he knows?
        That God is good and the rest is breath;
Why else is the same styled Sharon's rose?
        Once a rose, ever a rose, he saith.

        O, John shall yet find a rose, he saith!

Alack, there be roses and roses, John!
        Some, honied of taste like your leman's  tongue:
Some, bitter; for why? (roast gaily on!)
        Their tree struck root in devil's-dung.
When Paul once reasoned of righteousness
        And of temperance and of judgment to come,
Good Felix trembled, he could no less:
        John, snickering, crook'd his wicked thumb.

        What cometh to John of the wicked thumb?

Ha ha, John plucketh now at his rose
        To rid himself of a sorrow at heart!
Lo,--petal on petal, fierce rays unclose;
        Anther on anther, sharp spikes outstart;
And with blood for dew, the bosom boils;
        And a gust of sulphur is all its smell;
And lo, he is horribly in the toils
        Of a coal-black giant flower of hell!

        What maketh heaven, That maketh hell.

So, as John called now, through the fire amain,
        On the Name, he had cursed with, all his life--
To the Person, he bought and sold again--
        For the Face, with his daily buffets rife--
Feature by feature It took its place:
        And his voice, like a mad dog's choking bark,
At the steady whole of the Judge's face--
        Died. Forth John's soul flared into the dark.

        God help all poor souls lost in the dark!
```

## To Frances S. Osgood by Edgar Allan Poe

```
Thou wouldst be loved?--then let thy heart
  From its present pathway part not;

Shall be an endless theme of praise.
  And love a simple duty.

## A Better Ressurection by Christina Rossetti

```
I have no wit, no words, no tears;
My heart within me like a stone
Is numbed too much for hopes or fears.
Look right, look left, I dwell alone;
I lift mine eyes, but dimmed with grief
No everlasting hills I see;
My life is in the falling leaf:
O Jesus, quicken me.

My life is like a faded leaf,
My harvest dwindled to a husk:
Truly my life is void and brief
And tedious in the barren dusk;
My life is like a frozen thing,
No bud nor greenness can I see:
Yet rise it shall--the sap of spring;
O Jesus, rise in me.

My life is like a broken bowl,
A broken bowl that cannot hold
One drop of water for my soul
Or cordial in the searching cold;
Cast in the fire the perished thing;
Melt and remould it, till it be
A royal cup for Him, my King:
O Jesus, drink of me.
```
