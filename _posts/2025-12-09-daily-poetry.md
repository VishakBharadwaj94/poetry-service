## Winter Song by Wilfred Owen

```
The browns, the olives, and the yellows died,
And were swept up to heaven; where they glowed
Each dawn and set of sun till Christmastide,
And when the land lay pale for them, pale-snowed,
Fell back, and down the snow-drifts flamed and flowed.

From off your face, into the winds of winter,
The sun-brown and the summer-gold are blowing;
But they shall gleam with spiritual glinter,
When paler beauty on your brows falls snowing,
And through those snows my looks shall be soft-going.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "Winter Song" by Wilfred Owen is structured in a traditional form with a consistent rhyme scheme. The poem consists of two stanzas, each containing six lines. The rhyme scheme is ABABCC, where the second and fourth lines rhyme with each other, and the final two lines of each stanza rhyme with each other. This regular rhyme scheme creates a musical quality to the poem that enhances its lyrical nature.

In terms of meter, the poem follows a consistent iambic pattern with five stresses per line. This steady rhythm contributes to the overall musicality of the poem and helps to convey a sense of flow and continuity. The use of enjambment, where a sentence or phrase continues onto the next line without a pause, also adds to the fluidity of the poem.

The structure of the poem, with its balanced stanzas and regular rhyme scheme, reflects the sense of order and harmony that the speaker finds in the changing of the seasons.

### Themes and Imagery

The themes of transience, beauty, and renewal are central to "Winter Song." The poem explores the cycle of life and death through the changing seasons, using vivid imagery to depict the transformation of nature. The browns, olives, and yellows that "died" in autumn are described as being "swept up to heaven," where they continue to "glow" until Christmastide. This imagery of colors being lifted up to the heavens symbolizes the beauty and spiritual significance of the changing seasons.

The poem also explores the idea of inner beauty and spiritual growth through the metaphor of winter. The speaker describes how the summer colors of "sun-brown and summer-gold" will transform into a "spiritual glinter" when "paler beauty" falls like snow on the recipient's brow. This image suggests a deeper, more profound beauty that emerges through the process of change and renewal.

Overall, the imagery in the poem captures the fleeting nature of beauty and the transformative power of the seasons, inviting the reader to reflect on the cyclical nature of life and the enduring presence of beauty in all its forms.

### Literary Devices

Owen employs several literary devices in "Winter Song" to enhance the poem's themes and imagery. One notable device is personification, where nature is given human-like qualities. For example, the colors of autumn are described as "dying" and being "swept up to heaven," creating a sense of movement and life in the natural world.

The use of metaphor is also prevalent in the poem, particularly in the comparison of the changing seasons to the process of inner growth and transformation. The speaker's looks are described as "soft-going" through the snow, suggesting a gentle and gradual evolution of beauty and spirit.

Additionally, Owen uses alliteration and assonance to create a musical quality in the poem. For example, the repetition of the "s" sound in "sun-brown" and "summer-gold" adds to the sensory richness of the imagery and reinforces the theme of seasonal change.

### Historical and Personal Context

Wilfred Owen is renowned for his powerful war poetry that vividly depicts the horrors of World War I. While "Winter Song" does not directly address war, it reflects Owen's broader thematic concerns with beauty, mortality, and the natural world. The poem was likely written during Owen's service in the war, where he would have witnessed firsthand the destruction and devastation of nature caused by conflict.

Owen's personal experiences in the war undoubtedly informed his depiction of the changing seasons in "Winter Song," as he sought to find moments of beauty and transcendence amidst the chaos and destruction of battle. The poem can be seen as a meditation on the enduring power of nature and the human spirit to persevere in the face of adversity.

### Deep Reading

Beyond its surface depiction of the changing seasons, "Winter Song" can be interpreted as a meditation on the passage of time and the inevitability of transformation. The colors of autumn that "died" and were "swept up to heaven" symbolize the impermanence of youth and vitality, while the arrival of winter represents a period of reflection and inner growth.

The contrast between the vibrant summer colors and the "paler beauty" of winter suggests a shift from external to internal beauty, emphasizing the importance of spiritual and emotional growth over physical appearances. The speaker's promise that his looks will be "soft-going" through the snow implies a gentle and compassionate approach to change and renewal, reflecting a deeper understanding of the cyclical nature of life.

Ultimately, "Winter Song" invites the reader to contemplate the interconnectedness of the natural world and the human experience, encouraging us to find beauty and meaning in the inevitable cycles of life and death.

## Home by Rupert Brooke

```
I came back late and tired last night
Into my little room,
To the long chair and the firelight
And comfortable gloom.

But as I entered softly in
I saw a woman there,
The line of neck and cheek and chin,
The darkness of her hair,
The form of one I did not know
Sitting in my chair.

I stood a moment fierce and still,
Watching her neck and hair.
I made a step to her; and saw
That there was no one there.

It was some trick of the firelight
That made me see her there.
It was a chance of shade and light
And the cushion in the chair.

Oh, all you happy over the earth,
That night, how could I sleep?
I lay and watched the lonely gloom;
And watched the moonlight creep
From wall to basin, round the room,
All night I could not sleep.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "Home" by Rupert Brooke consists of 24 lines divided into three stanzas of eight lines each. The poem follows a consistent rhyme scheme of ABABCCDD, with the end rhymes alternating between the stanzas. The meter is predominantly iambic tetrameter, with four stressed syllables per line. This regular structure creates a sense of stability and control that contrasts with the unsettling tone of the poem.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem is the idea of home as a place of comfort and familiarity. The speaker returns to his room expecting solace and rest, only to be confronted by a mysterious and unsettling presence. The imagery in the poem is vivid and evocative, particularly in the description of the woman in the chair. The detailed depiction of her "neck and hair" and the "darkness of her hair" creates a sense of unease and mystery. The contrast between the warm firelight and the lonely gloom further emphasizes the theme of displacement and disorientation.

### Literary Devices

Brooke employs several literary devices to enhance the poem's atmosphere and convey its themes. The use of personification is evident in the description of the firelight as playing "some trick" and the moonlight as "creeping" around the room. These personifications create a sense of a malevolent presence lurking in the shadows. The repetition of the word "watched" in the final stanza emphasizes the speaker's sense of unease and insomnia, highlighting his inability to find peace and rest.

### Historical and Personal Context

Rupert Brooke was a British poet who lived during the early 20th century. He is best known for his war poetry, particularly his sonnets written during World War I. While "Home" does not directly address war, it reflects Brooke's broader themes of displacement, uncertainty, and the search for stability in a rapidly changing world. The poem can be seen as a reflection of the anxieties and uncertainties of the time, as well as a personal exploration of the concept of home and belonging.

### Deep Reading

On a deeper level, "Home" can be interpreted as a meditation on the fragility of our sense of security and belonging. The speaker's experience of seeing a stranger in his own home disrupts his sense of familiarity and comfort, leading to a profound sense of unease and disorientation. This disruption reflects broader themes of alienation and the impermanence of our surroundings. The poem ultimately raises questions about the nature of home and the extent to which it is a physical place or a state of mind. By blurring the boundaries between reality and illusion, Brooke invites readers to consider the complexities of identity, memory, and perception.

## Faith and Despondency by Emily Bronte

```
The winter wind is loud and wild,
Come close to me, my darling child;
Forsake thy books, and mateless play;
And, while the night is gathering grey,
We'll talk its pensive hours away;--

'Ierne, round our sheltered hall
November's gusts unheeded call;
Not one faint breath can enter here
Enough to wave my daughter's hair,
And I am glad to watch the blaze
Glance from her eyes, with mimic rays;
To feel her cheek so softly pressed,
In happy quiet on my breast.

'But, yet, even this tranquillity
Brings bitter, restless thoughts to me;
And, in the red fire's cheerful glow,
I think of deep glens, blocked with snow;
I dream of moor, and misty hill,
Where evening closes dark and chill;
For, lone, among the mountains cold,
Lie those that I have loved of old.
And my heart aches, in hopeless pain
Exhausted with repinings vain,
That I shall greet them ne'er again!'

'Father, in early infancy,
When you were far beyond the sea,
Such thoughts were tyrants over me!
I often sat, for hours together,
Through the long nights of angry weather,
Raised on my pillow, to descry
The dim moon struggling in the sky;

Or, with strained ear, to catch the shock,
Of rock with wave, and wave with rock;
So would I fearful vigil keep,
And, all for listening, never sleep.
But this world's life has much to dread,
Not so, my Father, with the dead.

'Oh! not for them, should we despair,
The grave is drear, but they are not there;
Their dust is mingled with the sod,
Their happy souls are gone to God!
You told me this, and yet you sigh,
And murmur that your friends must die.
Ah! my dear father, tell me why?

For, if your former words were true,
How useless would such sorrow be;
As wise, to mourn the seed which grew
Unnoticed on its parent tree,
Because it fell in fertile earth,
And sprang up to a glorious birth--
Struck deep its root, and lifted high
Its green boughs, in the breezy sky.

'But, I'll not fear, I will not weep
For those whose bodies rest in sleep,--
I know there is a blessed shore,
Opening its ports for me, and mine;
And, gazing Time's wide waters o'er,
I weary for that land divine,
Where we were born, where you and I
Shall meet our Dearest, when we die;
From suffering and corruption free,
Restored into the Deity.'

'Well hast thou spoken, sweet, trustful child!
And wiser than thy sire;
And worldly tempests, raging wild,
Shall strengthen thy desire--
Thy fervent hope, through storm and foam,
Through wind and ocean's roar,
To reach, at last, the eternal home,
The steadfast, changeless, shore!'
```
