## Whatever it is -- she has tried it -- by Emily Dickinson

```
Whatever it is -- she has tried it --
Awful Father of Love --
Is not Ours the chastising --
Do not chastise the Dove --

Not for Ourselves, petition --
Nothing is left to pray --
When a subject is finished --
Words are handed away --

Only lest she be lonely
In thy beautiful House
Give her for her Transgression
License to think of us --
```

## The Happiest Day by Edgar Allan Poe

```
The happiest day--the happiest hour
  My seared and blighted heart hath known,
The highest hope of pride and power,
  I feel hath flown.

Of power! said I? Yes! such I ween
  But they have vanished long, alas!
The visions of my youth have been--
  But let them pass.

And pride, what have I now with thee?
  Another brow may ev'n inherit
The venom thou hast poured on me--
  Be still my spirit!

The happiest day--the happiest hour
  Mine eyes shall see--have ever seen
The brightest glance of pride and power
  I feel have been:

But were that hope of pride and power
  Now offered with the pain
Ev'n _then_ I felt--that brightest hour
  I would not live again:

For on its wing was dark alloy
  And as it fluttered--fell
An essence--powerful to destroy
  A soul that knew it well.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

This poem by Edgar Allan Poe is structured as a series of quatrains, with four-line stanzas. Each stanza follows an ABAB rhyme scheme, where the first and third lines rhyme with each other, as do the second and fourth lines. The consistent rhyme scheme adds a sense of musicality to the poem, enhancing its lyrical quality. 

In terms of meter, the poem does not strictly adhere to a specific metrical pattern. However, there is a noticeable rhythm in the lines, with a mix of iambic and trochaic rhythms creating a flowing yet slightly uneven cadence. This irregular meter mirrors the tumultuous emotions expressed by the speaker, adding to the overall melancholic tone of the poem.

### Themes and Imagery

The central themes of the poem revolve around loss, regret, and the fleeting nature of happiness. The speaker reflects on what he perceives as the happiest day of his life, only to realize that it was tainted by pain and ultimately led to his downfall. The imagery of a "seared and blighted heart" and "venom" poured on him conveys a sense of emotional turmoil and betrayal. The contrast between pride and power, once desirable attributes, now evoke feelings of emptiness and disillusionment.

Additionally, the imagery of "brightest glance of pride and power" juxtaposed with "dark alloy" and "essence powerful to destroy" highlights the duality of joy and sorrow, success and failure. The speaker's internal conflict between longing for past happiness and accepting the harsh reality of his experiences is palpable throughout the poem.

### Literary Devices

Poe employs several literary devices to enhance the emotional impact of the poem. One notable device is repetition, particularly in the refrain of "the happiest day--the happiest hour," which emphasizes the fleeting nature of joy and underscores the speaker's sense of loss. The use of personification is evident in lines such as "let them pass" and "be still my spirit," where abstract concepts like pride and power are given human-like qualities, adding depth to the speaker's emotional turmoil.

The poem also features imagery, such as "fluttered--fell" and "an essence--powerful to destroy," which conveys a sense of instability and downfall. The metaphor of a wing carrying both joy and sorrow encapsulates the conflicting emotions experienced by the speaker, making the theme of duality more poignant.

### Historical and Personal Context

Written during the Romantic period, Poe's poem reflects the era's fascination with introspection and the exploration of complex human emotions. The speaker's introspective reflection on past experiences and the juxtaposition of external success with internal turmoil are characteristic themes of Romantic poetry. 

Poe's personal struggles with loss, grief, and inner demons are also mirrored in this poem. The speaker's sense of disillusionment and resignation to a fate marred by pain resonate with Poe's own tumultuous life marked by tragedy and hardship. This personal connection adds a layer of authenticity to the speaker's emotional journey in the poem.

### Deep Reading

At its core, "The Happiest Day" delves into the paradoxical nature of happiness and the inevitability of suffering. The speaker's realization that even the brightest moments are tinged with sorrow speaks to the universal experience of human fragility and the transience of joy. The poem serves as a poignant reminder that true happiness often comes at a cost, and that the pursuit of power and pride can lead to spiritual destruction.

Furthermore, the speaker's rejection of reliving past moments of happiness, despite their allure, underscores a deeper understanding of the complexities of human existence. By acknowledging the dark undercurrents that accompany moments of joy, the speaker embraces a sense of wisdom and acceptance of life's inherent sorrows. Ultimately, "The Happiest Day" serves as a contemplative meditation on the ephemeral nature of happiness and the enduring impact of pain on the human soul.

## The Patriot: An Old Story by Robert Browning

```
It was roses, roses, all the way,
  With myrtle mixed in my path like mad;
The house-roofs seemed to heave and sway,
  The church-spires flamed, such flags they had,
A year ago on this very day.

The air broke into a mist with bells,
  The old walls rocked with the crowd and cries.
Had I said, "Good folk, mere noise repels--
  But give me your sun from yonder skies!"
They had answered "And afterward, what else?"

Alack, it was I who leaped at the sun
  To give it my loving friends to keep!
Naught man could do, have I left undone:
  And you see my harvest, what I reap
This very day, now a year is run.

There's nobody on the house-tops now--
  Just a palsied few at the windows set;
For the best of the sight is, all allow,
  At the Shambles' Gate--or, better yet,
By the very scaffold's foot, I trow.

I go in the rain, and, more than needs,
  A rope cuts both my wrists behind;
And I think, by the feel, my forehead bleeds,
  For they fling, whoever has a mind,
Stones at me for my year's misdeeds.

Thus I entered, and thus I go!
  In triumphs, people have dropped down dead,
"Paid by the world, what dost thou owe
  Me? "--God might question; now instead,
'Tis God shall repay: I am safer so.
```
