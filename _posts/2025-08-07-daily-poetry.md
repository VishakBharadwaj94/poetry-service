## Stars by Emily Bronte

```
Ah! why, because the dazzling sun
Restored our Earth to joy,
Have you departed, every one,
And left a desert sky?

All through the night, your glorious eyes
Were gazing down in mine,
And, with a full heart's thankful sighs,
I blessed that watch divine.

I was at peace, and drank your beams
As they were life to me;
And revelled in my changeful dreams,
Like petrel on the sea.

Thought followed thought, star followed star
Through boundless regions on;
While one sweet influence, near and far,
Thrilled through, and proved us one!

Why did the morning dawn to break
So great, so pure a spell;
And scorch with fire the tranquil cheek,
Where your cool radiance fell?

Blood-red, he rose, and arrow-straight,
His fierce beams struck my brow;
The soul of nature sprang, elate,
But mine sank sad and low.

My lids closed down, yet through their veil
I saw him, blazinig, still,
And steep in gold the misty dale,
And flash upon the hill.

I turned me to the pillow, then,
To call back night, and see
Your words of solemn light, again,
Throb with my heart, and me!

It would not do - the pillow glowed,
And glowed both roof and floor;
And birds sang loudly in the wood,
And fresh winds shook the door;

The curtains waved, the wakened flies
Were murmuring round my room,
Imprisoned there, till I should rise,
And give them leave to roam.

O stars, and dreams, and gentle night;
O night and stars, return!
And hide me from the hostile light
That does not warm, but burn;

That drains the blood of suffering men;
Drinks tears, instead of dew;
Let me sleep through his blinding reign,
And only wake with you!
```

Through the imagery of stars and dreams, Bronte conveys a sense of hope and resilience in the face of adversity, suggesting that even in the darkest of times, there is always the possibility of finding light and solace in the beauty of the natural world.

Overall, "Stars" is a deeply introspective and evocative poem that invites readers to contemplate the complexities of human emotions, the mysteries of the universe, and the enduring power of nature to inspire and uplift the soul.

## Matilda Gathering Flowers by Percy Bysshe Shelley

```
FROM THE PURGATORIO OF DANTE, CANTO 28, LINES 1-51.

And earnest to explore within--around--
The divine wood, whose thick green living woof
Tempered the young day to the sight--I wound

Up the green slope, beneath the forest's roof,
With slow, soft steps leaving the mountain's steep,
And sought those inmost labyrinths, motion-proof

Against the air, that in that stillness deep
And solemn, struck upon my forehead bare,
The slow, soft stroke of a continuous...

In which the ... leaves tremblingly were
All bent towards that part where earliest
The sacred hill obscures the morning air.

Yet were they not so shaken from the rest,
But that the birds, perched on the utmost spray,
Incessantly renewing their blithe quest,

With perfect joy received the early day,
Singing within the glancing leaves, whose sound
Kept a low burden to their roundelay,

Such as from bough to bough gathers around
The pine forest on bleak Chiassi's shore,
When Aeolus Sirocco has unbound.

My slow steps had already borne me o'er
Such space within the antique wood, that I
Perceived not where I entered any more,--

When, lo! a stream whose little waves went by,
Bending towards the left through grass that grew
Upon its bank, impeded suddenly

My going on. Water of purest hue
On earth, would appear turbid and impure
Compared with this, whose unconcealing dew,

Dark, dark, yet clear, moved under the obscure
Eternal shades, whose interwoven looms
The rays of moon or sunlight ne'er endure.

I moved not with my feet, but mid the glooms
Pierced with my charmed eye, contemplating
The mighty multitude of fresh May blooms

Which starred that night, when, even as a thing
That suddenly, for blank astonishment,
Charms every sense, and makes all thought take wing,--

A solitary woman! and she went
Singing and gathering flower after flower,
With which her way was painted and besprent.

'Bright lady, who, if looks had ever power
To bear true witness of the heart within,
Dost bask under the beams of love, come lower

Towards this bank. I prithee let me win
This much of thee, to come, that I may hear
Thy song: like Proserpine, in Enna's glen,

Thou seemest to my fancy, singing here
And gathering flowers, as that fair maiden when
She lost the Spring, and Ceres her, more dear.
```

## Insensibility by Wilfred Owen

```
I

Happy are men who yet before they are killed
Can let their veins run cold.
Whom no compassion fleers
Or makes their feet
Sore on the alleys cobbled with their brothers.
The front line withers,
But they are troops who fade, not flowers
For poets' tearful fooling:
Men, gaps for filling
Losses who might have fought
Longer; but no one bothers.


    II

And some cease feeling
Even themselves or for themselves.
Dullness best solves
The tease and doubt of shelling,
And Chance's strange arithmetic
Comes simpler than the reckoning of their shilling.
They keep no check on Armies' decimation.


    III

Happy are these who lose imagination:
They have enough to carry with ammunition.
Their spirit drags no pack.
Their old wounds save with cold can not more ache.
Having seen all things red,
Their eyes are rid
Of the hurt of the colour of blood for ever.
And terror's first constriction over,
Their hearts remain small drawn.
Their senses in some scorching cautery of battle
Now long since ironed,
Can laugh among the dying, unconcerned.


    IV

Happy the soldier home, with not a notion
How somewhere, every dawn, some men attack,
And many sighs are drained.
Happy the lad whose mind was never trained:
His days are worth forgetting more than not.
He sings along the march
Which we march taciturn, because of dusk,
The long, forlorn, relentless trend
From larger day to huger night.


    V

We wise, who with a thought besmirch
Blood over all our soul,
How should we see our task
But through his blunt and lashless eyes?
Alive, he is not vital overmuch;
Dying, not mortal overmuch;
Nor sad, nor proud,
Nor curious at all.
He cannot tell
Old men's placidity from his.


    VI

But cursed are dullards whom no cannon stuns,
That they should be as stones.
Wretched are they, and mean
With paucity that never was simplicity.
By choice they made themselves immune
To pity and whatever mourns in man
Before the last sea and the hapless stars;
Whatever mourns when many leave these shores;
Whatever shares
The eternal reciprocity of tears.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme
The poem "Insensibility" by Wilfred Owen is structured into six stanzas, each exploring different aspects of the theme of insensitivity towards the horrors of war. The poem does not adhere to a strict meter or rhyme scheme, allowing the content to take precedence over formal constraints. The lack of rhyme and irregular meter reflects the chaotic and disordered nature of war, reinforcing the message of the poem.

### Themes and Imagery
The central theme of the poem is the numbness and emotional detachment that soldiers experience as a coping mechanism in the face of the brutalities of war. Owen portrays the soldiers as being desensitized to violence, pain, and death, suggesting that this insensibility is a necessary survival mechanism in the face of overwhelming suffering. The imagery of soldiers who can no longer feel compassion or pain, who have lost their imagination and emotional capacity, conveys the devastating impact of war on the human psyche.

### Literary Devices
Owen employs various literary devices to convey the theme of insensibility effectively. The use of paradox in lines like "Happy are men who yet before they are killed / Can let their veins run cold" juxtaposes happiness with death and numbness. Alliteration is used in phrases like "foolish tearful fooling" to emphasize the sense of futility in mourning the loss of life in war. Owen also utilizes symbolism, such as the color red representing blood and violence, to evoke powerful imagery that highlights the dehumanizing effects of war.

### Historical and Personal Context
Wilfred Owen was a soldier in World War I, which greatly influenced his poetry. "Insensibility" reflects Owen's firsthand experience of the horrors of war and his deep empathy for the soldiers who endured its traumas. The poem critiques the glorification of war and challenges the romanticized notions of heroism, highlighting the psychological toll that war takes on individuals.

### Deep Reading
Through "Insensibility," Owen invites readers to question the human cost of war and the ways in which individuals are forced to suppress their emotions in order to survive. The poem raises profound moral and existential questions about the nature of suffering, empathy, and resilience in the face of overwhelming adversity. By portraying the soldiers as emotionally detached and desensitized, Owen challenges the notion of war as a noble or heroic endeavor, instead revealing its capacity to dehumanize and destroy. The poem's haunting imagery and powerful language serve as a poignant reminder of the enduring impact of war on the human spirit.
