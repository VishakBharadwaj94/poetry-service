## Lines Written In Early Spring by William Wordsworth

```
I heard a thousand blended notes,
While in a grove I sate reclined,
In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts
Bring sad thoughts to the mind.

To her fair works did Nature link
The human soul that through me ran;
And much it grieved my heart to think
What man has made of man.

Through primrose tufts, in that green bower,
The periwinkle trailed its wreaths;
And 'tis my faith that every flower
Enjoys the air it breathes.

The birds around me hopped and played,
Their thoughts I cannot measure:--
But the least motion which they made
It seemed a thrill of pleasure.

The budding twigs spread out their fan,
To catch the breezy air;
And I must think, do all I can,
That there was pleasure there.

If this belief from heaven be sent,
If such be Nature's holy plan,
Have I not reason to lament
What man has made of man?
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "Lines Written In Early Spring" by William Wordsworth consists of four quatrains, each with a rhyme scheme of ABAB. The meter is primarily iambic tetrameter, with lines alternating between four stressed syllables and four unstressed syllables. This regular rhythm and rhyme scheme create a sense of harmony and balance in the poem, mirroring the themes of nature and interconnectedness that are central to the work.

### Themes and Imagery

One of the central themes of the poem is the contrast between the beauty and harmony of nature and the destructive nature of human actions. Wordsworth uses vivid imagery throughout the poem to convey this theme, such as the "thousand blended notes" of the birds, the "fair works" of nature, and the budding twigs spreading out their fan. These images not only evoke a sense of the beauty of the natural world but also highlight the speaker's lament for what humanity has done to it.

The poem also explores the idea of interconnectedness between humanity and nature. Wordsworth suggests that nature is linked to the human soul and that every flower and bird experiences pleasure in their existence. This interconnectedness serves as a reminder of the importance of living in harmony with the natural world.

### Literary Devices

Wordsworth employs several literary devices in the poem to enhance its themes and imagery. One such device is personification, as seen in lines such as "To her fair works did Nature link" and "every flower / Enjoys the air it breathes." By attributing human qualities to nature, Wordsworth emphasizes the idea of interconnectedness between humanity and the natural world.

The poem also features the use of paradox, as the speaker experiences both "pleasant thoughts" and "sad thoughts" simultaneously. This juxtaposition highlights the complex relationship between humanity and nature, as well as the speaker's conflicting emotions about the state of the world.

### Historical and Personal Context

"Lines Written In Early Spring" was written during the Romantic period, a time when poets like Wordsworth sought to reconnect with nature and explore the beauty and power of the natural world. Wordsworth's own experiences with nature, particularly in the Lake District where he lived, influenced his poetic style and themes. The poem reflects his belief in the restorative power of nature and his concern for the impact of industrialization on the environment.

### Deep Reading

At its core, "Lines Written In Early Spring" is a meditation on the relationship between humanity and nature, as well as a reflection on the impact of human actions on the natural world. The poem invites readers to consider their own role in the interconnected web of life and to reflect on the beauty and fragility of the natural world. Through its vivid imagery, lyrical language, and poignant themes, Wordsworth's poem continues to resonate with readers today, serving as a timeless reminder of the importance of living in harmony with nature.

## Aurora Leigh (excerpts) by Elizabeth Barrett Browning

```
[Book 1]
I am like,
They tell me, my dear father. Broader brows
Howbeit, upon a slenderer undergrowth
Of delicate features, -- paler, near as grave ;
But then my mother's smile breaks up the whole,
And makes it better sometimes than itself.
So, nine full years, our days were hid with God
Among his mountains : I was just thirteen,
Still growing like the plants from unseen roots
In tongue-tied Springs, -- and suddenly awoke
To full life and life 's needs and agonies,
With an intense, strong, struggling heart beside
A stone-dead father. Life, struck sharp on death,
Makes awful lightning. His last word was, `Love --'
`Love, my child, love, love !' -- (then he had done with grief)
`Love, my child.' Ere I answered he was gone,
And none was left to love in all the world.
There, ended childhood. What succeeded next
I recollect as, after fevers, men
Thread back the passage of delirium,
Missing the turn still, baffled by the door ;
Smooth endless days, notched here and there with knives ;
A weary, wormy darkness, spurr'd i' the flank
With flame, that it should eat and end itself
Like some tormented scorpion. Then at last
I do remember clearly, how there came
A stranger with authority, not right,
(I thought not) who commanded, caught me up
From old Assunta's neck ; how, with a shriek,
She let me go, -- while I, with ears too full
Of my father's silence, to shriek back a word,
In all a child's astonishment at grief
Stared at the wharf-edge where she stood and moaned,
My poor Assunta, where she stood and moaned !
The white walls, the blue hills, my Italy,
Drawn backward from the shuddering steamer-deck,
Like one in anger drawing back her skirts
Which supplicants catch at. Then the bitter sea
Inexorably pushed between us both,
And sweeping up the ship with my despair
Threw us out as a pasture to the stars.
Ten nights and days we voyaged on the deep ;
Ten nights and days, without the common face
Of any day or night ; the moon and sun
Cut off from the green reconciling earth,
To starve into a blind ferocity
And glare unnatural ; the very sky
(Dropping its bell-net down upon the sea
As if no human heart should 'scape alive,)
Bedraggled with the desolating salt,
Until it seemed no more that holy heaven
To which my father went. All new and strange
The universe turned stranger, for a child.
Then, land ! -- then, England ! oh, the frosty cliffs
Looked cold upon me. Could I find a home
Among those mean red houses through the fog ?
And when I heard my father's language first
From alien lips which had no kiss for mine
I wept aloud, then laughed, then wept, then wept,
And some one near me said the child was mad
Through much sea-sickness. The train swept us on.
Was this my father's England ? the great isle ?
The ground seemed cut up from the fellowship
Of verdure, field from field, as man from man ;
The skies themselves looked low and positive,
As almost you could touch them with a hand,
And dared to do it they were so far off
From God's celestial crystals ; all things blurred
And dull and vague. Did Shakspeare and his mates
Absorb the light here ? -- not a hill or stone
With heart to strike a radiant colour up
Or active outline on the indifferent air.
I think I see my father's sister stand
Upon the hall-step of her country-house
To give me welcome. She stood straight and calm,
Her somewhat narrow forehead braided tight
As if for taming accidental thoughts
From possible pulses ; brown hair pricked with grey
By frigid use of life, (she was not old
Although my father's elder by a year)
A nose drawn sharply yet in delicate lines ;
A close mild mouth, a little soured about
The ends, through speaking unrequited loves
Or peradventure niggardly half-truths ;
Eyes of no colour, -- once they might have smiled,
But never, never have forgot themselves
In smiling ; cheeks, in which was yet a rose
Of perished summers, like a rose in a book,
Kept more for ruth than pleasure, -- if past bloom,
Past fading also.
She had lived, we'll say,
A harmless life, she called a virtuous life,
A quiet life, which was not life at all,
(But that, she had not lived enough to know)
Between the vicar and the country squires,
The lord-lieutenant looking down sometimes
From the empyrean to assure their souls
Against chance-vulgarisms, and, in the abyss
The apothecary, looked on once a year
To prove their soundness of humility.
The poor-club exercised her Christian gifts
Of knitting stockings, stitching petticoats,
Because we are of one flesh after all
And need one flannel (with a proper sense
Of difference in the quality) -- and still
The book-club, guarded from your modern trick
Of shaking dangerous questions from the crease,
Preserved her intellectual. She had lived
A sort of cage-bird life, born in a cage,
Accounting that to leap from perch to perch
Was act and joy enough for any bird.
Dear heaven, how silly are the things that live
In thickets, and eat berries !
I, alas,
A wild bird scarcely fledged, was brought to her cage,
And she was there to meet me. Very kind.
Bring the clean water, give out the fresh seed.
She stood upon the steps to welcome me,
Calm, in black garb. I clung about her neck, --
Young babes, who catch at every shred of wool
To draw the new light closer, catch and cling
Less blindly. In my ears, my father's word
Hummed ignorantly, as the sea in shells,
`Love, love, my child.' She, black there with my grief,
Might feel my love -- she was his sister once,
I clung to her. A moment, she seemed moved,
Kissed me with cold lips, suffered me to cling,
And drew me feebly through the hall into
The room she sate in.
There, with some strange spasm
Of pain and passion, she wrung loose my hands
Imperiously, and held me at arm's length,
And with two grey-steel naked-bladed eyes
Searched through my face, -- ay, stabbed it through and through,
Through brows and cheeks and chin, as if to find
A wicked murderer in my innocent face,
If not here, there perhaps. Then, drawing breath,
She struggled for her ordinary calm
And missed it rather, -- told me not to shrink,
As if she had told me not to lie or swear, --
`She loved my father, and would love me too
As long as I deserved it.' Very kind.

[Book 5]

AURORA LEIGH, be humble. Shall I hope
To speak my poems in mysterious tune
With man and nature ? -- with the lava-lymph
That trickles from successive galaxies
Still drop by drop adown the finger of God
In still new worlds ? -- with summer-days in this ?
That scarce dare breathe they are so beautiful ?--
With spring's delicious trouble in the ground,
Tormented by the quickened blood of roots,
And softly pricked by golden crocus-sheaves
In token of the harvest-time of flowers ?--
With winters and with autumns, -- and beyond,
With the human heart's large seasons, when it hopes
And fears, joys, grieves, and loves ? -- with all that strain
Of sexual passion, which devours the flesh
In a sacrament of souls ? with mother's breasts
Which, round the new-made creatures hanging there,
Throb luminous and harmonious like pure spheres ? --
With multitudinous life, and finally
With the great escapings of ecstatic souls,
Who, in a rush of too long prisoned flame,
Their radiant faces upward, burn away
This dark of the body, issuing on a world,
Beyond our mortal ? -- can I speak my verse
Sp plainly in tune to these things and the rest,
That men shall feel it catch them on the quick,
As having the same warrant over them
To hold and move them if they will or no,
Alike imperious as the primal rhythm
Of that theurgic nature ? I must fail,
Who fail at the beginning to hold and move
One man, -- and he my cousin, and he my friend,
And he born tender, made intelligent,
Inclined to ponder the precipitous sides
Of difficult questions ; yet, obtuse to me,
Of me, incurious ! likes me very well,
And wishes me a paradise of good,
Good looks, good means, and good digestion, -- ay,
But otherwise evades me, puts me off
With kindness, with a tolerant gentleness, --
Too light a book for a grave man's reading ! Go,
Aurora Leigh : be humble.
There it is,
We women are too apt to look to One,
Which proves a certain impotence in art.
We strain our natures at doing something great,
Far less because it 's something great to do,
Than haply that we, so, commend ourselves
As being not small, and more appreciable
To some one friend. We must have mediators
Betwixt our highest conscience and the judge ;
Some sweet saint's blood must quicken in our palms
Or all the life in heaven seems slow and cold :
Good only being perceived as the end of good,
And God alone pleased, -- that's too poor, we think,
And not enough for us by any means.
Ay, Romney, I remember, told me once
We miss the abstract when we comprehend.
We miss it most when we aspire, -- and fail.
Yet, so, I will not. -- This vile woman's way
Of trailing garments, shall not trip me up :
I 'll have no traffic with the personal thought
In art's pure temple. Must I work in vain,
Without the approbation of a man ?
It cannot be ; it shall not. Fame itself,
That approbation of the general race,
Presents a poor end, (though the arrow speed,
Shot straight with vigorous finger to the white,)
And the highest fame was never reached except
By what was aimed above it. Art for art,
And good for God Himself, the essential Good !
We 'll keep our aims sublime, our eyes erect,
Although our woman-hands should shake and fail ;
And if we fail .. But must we ? --
Shall I fail ?
The Greeks said grandly in their tragic phrase,
`Let no one be called happy till his death.'
To which I add, -- Let no one till his death
Be called unhappy. Measure not the work
Until the day 's out and the labour done,
Then bring your gauges. If the day's work 's scant,
Why, call it scant ; affect no compromise ;
And, in that we have nobly striven at least,
Deal with us nobly, women though we be.
And honour us with truth if not with praise.

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

In Elizabeth Barrett Browning's poem "Aurora Leigh," the form is predominantly written in blank verse, utilizing unrhymed iambic pentameter. This structure allows for a natural flow of language while maintaining a sense of seriousness and depth. The lack of rhyme scheme gives the poem a more conversational and introspective tone, allowing the reader to focus on the content rather than the form. However, Browning does incorporate occasional rhyme and varied meter in certain sections of the poem, such as in Book 1 where she describes the speaker's arrival in England. This variation in structure adds emphasis to specific themes and moments in the narrative, highlighting the emotional weight of the speaker's experiences.

### Themes and Imagery

One of the central themes in "Aurora Leigh" is the exploration of identity and self-discovery, particularly in the context of societal expectations and personal relationships. The poem delves into the protagonist's journey of finding her voice and asserting her independence in a male-dominated world. Through vivid imagery, Browning paints a picture of contrasting landscapes and emotions, from the serene mountains of Italy to the frosty cliffs of England. The use of vivid descriptions, such as "the ground seemed cut up from the fellowship of verdure" and "the skies themselves looked low and positive," creates a stark contrast between the protagonist's inner turmoil and external environment, reflecting her internal struggles and external challenges.

### Literary Devices

Browning employs a variety of literary devices throughout the poem to enhance its themes and imagery. One notable device is the use of symbolism, such as the cage-bird metaphor to represent the protagonist's sense of confinement and longing for freedom. Additionally, Browning utilizes personification, as seen in lines like "the bitter sea inexorably pushed between us both," giving human qualities to the natural elements to convey the emotional distance between the speaker and her past. The poem also features vivid sensory imagery, such as "the quickened blood of roots" and "the harvest-time of flowers," immersing the reader in the protagonist's emotional and physical experiences.

### Historical and Personal Context

"Aurora Leigh" was written by Elizabeth Barrett Browning during the Victorian era, a time when women's voices and experiences were often marginalized in society. Browning herself faced societal constraints as a female poet, which is reflected in the themes of gender roles and artistic ambition explored in the poem. The protagonist's struggles to navigate her identity and assert her creative agency mirror Browning's own challenges as a woman writer in a male-dominated literary world. By weaving personal experiences into the narrative, Browning sheds light on the limitations and possibilities for women in the Victorian era.

### Deep Reading

At its core, "Aurora Leigh" is a profound exploration of the complexities of identity, creativity, and societal expectations. The protagonist's journey from childhood trauma to artistic self-realization mirrors Browning's own struggles and triumphs as a female poet. Through the use of introspective language, vivid imagery, and literary devices, Browning invites readers to reflect on the challenges of pursuing one's passion and finding one's voice in a world that seeks to silence and constrain. Ultimately, "Aurora Leigh" serves as a powerful testament to the resilience and creativity of women in the face of societal barriers, inspiring readers to embrace their individuality and strive for artistic excellence despite the odds.

## Silence by Edgar Allan Poe

```
There are some qualities--some incorporate things,
  That have a double life, which thus is made
A type of that twin entity which springs
  From matter and light, evinced in solid and shade.
There is a twofold _Silence_--sea and shore--
  Body and soul. One dwells in lonely places,
  Newly with grass o'ergrown; some solemn graces,
Some human memories and tearful lore,
Render him terrorless: his name's "No More."
He is the corporate Silence: dread him not!
  No power hath he of evil in himself;
But should some urgent fate (untimely lot!)
  Bring thee to meet his shadow (nameless elf,
That haunteth the lone regions where hath trod
No foot of man), commend thyself to God!
```
