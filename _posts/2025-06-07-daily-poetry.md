## Spring Offensive by Wilfred Owen

```
Halted against the shade of a last hill,
They fed, and, lying easy, were at ease
And, finding comfortable chests and knees
Carelessly slept.  But many there stood still
To face the stark, blank sky beyond the ridge,
Knowing their feet had come to the end of the world.

Marvelling they stood, and watched the long grass swirled
By the May breeze, murmurous with wasp and midge,
For though the summer oozed into their veins
Like the injected drug for their bones' pains,
Sharp on their souls hung the imminent line of grass,
Fearfully flashed the sky's mysterious glass.

Hour after hour they ponder the warm field --
And the far valley behind, where the buttercups
Had blessed with gold their slow boots coming up,
Where even the little brambles would not yield,
But clutched and clung to them like sorrowing hands;
They breathe like trees unstirred.

Till like a cold gust thrilled the little word
At which each body and its soul begird
And tighten them for battle.  No alarms
Of bugles, no high flags, no clamorous haste --
Only a lift and flare of eyes that faced
The sun, like a friend with whom their love is done.
O larger shone that smile against the sun, --
Mightier than his whose bounty these have spurned.

So, soon they topped the hill, and raced together
Over an open stretch of herb and heather
Exposed.  And instantly the whole sky burned
With fury against them; and soft sudden cups
Opened in thousands for their blood; and the green slopes
Chasmed and steepened sheer to infinite space.

Of them who running on that last high place
Leapt to swift unseen bullets, or went up
On the hot blast and fury of hell's upsurge,
Or plunged and fell away past this world's verge,
Some say God caught them even before they fell.

But what say such as from existence' brink
Ventured but drave too swift to sink.
The few who rushed in the body to enter hell,
And there out-fiending all its fiends and flames
With superhuman inhumanities,
Long-famous glories, immemorial shames --
And crawling slowly back, have by degrees
Regained cool peaceful air in wonder --
Why speak they not of comrades that went under?
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "Spring Offensive" by Wilfred Owen is structured as a traditional sonnet, with 14 lines and a rhyme scheme of ABABCDCDEFEFGG. This traditional form is juxtaposed with the dark and disturbing subject matter of war, creating a sense of tension and contrast. The meter is predominantly iambic pentameter, lending a sense of regularity and formality to the poem. However, the use of enjambment, where sentences and phrases continue beyond the end of a line, disrupts the flow and creates a sense of unease, mirroring the chaotic nature of war.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem is the contrast between the beauty of nature and the brutality of war. Owen uses vivid imagery to convey this juxtaposition, such as the soldiers marveling at the long grass swirling in the May breeze while facing the stark, blank sky beyond the ridge. The contrast between the peaceful landscape and the impending violence of battle creates a sense of irony and highlights the senselessness of war. The imagery of the soldiers racing over an open stretch of herb and heather, only to be met with fury from the sky and soft sudden cups opening for their blood, vividly portrays the sudden and brutal nature of combat.

### Literary Devices

Owen employs various literary devices to convey the themes of the poem. The use of personification is evident in lines such as "the imminent line of grass" and "the sun, like a friend with whom their love is done," giving human qualities to inanimate objects to highlight the soldiers' emotions and experiences. Owen also uses similes, such as "Marvelling they stood, and watched the long grass swirled / By the May breeze, murmurous with wasp and midge," to create vivid and evocative imagery. The repetition of the word "only" in the line "Only a lift and flare of eyes that faced / the sun" emphasizes the simplicity and inevitability of the soldiers' fate.

### Historical and Personal Context

Wilfred Owen was a soldier in World War I, and his experiences in the war deeply influenced his poetry. "Spring Offensive" reflects Owen's firsthand experiences of the brutality and futility of war. The poem captures the disillusionment and horror of combat, as well as the camaraderie and loyalty of soldiers facing death together. Owen's personal experiences as a soldier lend authenticity and emotional depth to the poem, making it a powerful and poignant reflection on the human cost of war.

### Deep Reading

The title "Spring Offensive" is significant in that it suggests a sense of renewal and growth associated with spring, yet Owen subverts this expectation by portraying the violence and destruction of war. The use of religious imagery, such as the reference to God catching the soldiers before they fell, adds a layer of complexity to the poem, questioning the morality and justification of war. The final lines, questioning why those who survived do not speak of their fallen comrades, highlight the guilt and trauma experienced by survivors, as well as the collective amnesia that often surrounds the sacrifices made in war. Overall, "Spring Offensive" is a powerful and haunting portrayal of the impact of war on individuals and society.

## Merry Autumn by Paul Laurence Dunbar

```
It's all a farce,—these tales they tell
  About the breezes sighing,
And moans astir o'er field and dell,
  Because the year is dying.

Such principles are most absurd,—
  I care not who first taught 'em;
There's nothing known to beast or bird
  To make a solemn autumn.

In solemn times, when grief holds sway
  With countenance distressing,
You'll note the more of black and gray
  Will then be used in dressing.

Now purple tints are all around;
  The sky is blue and mellow;
And e'en the grasses turn the ground
  From modest green to yellow.

The seed burs all with laughter crack
  On featherweed and jimson;
And leaves that should be dressed in black
  Are all decked out in crimson.

A butterfly goes winging by;
  A singing bird comes after;
And Nature, all from earth to sky,
  Is bubbling o'er with laughter.

The ripples wimple on the rills,
  Like sparkling little lasses;
The sunlight runs along the hills,
  And laughs among the grasses.

The earth is just so full of fun
  It really can't contain it;
And streams of mirth so freely run
  The heavens seem to rain it.

Don't talk to me of solemn days
  In autumn's time of splendor,
Because the sun shows fewer rays,
  And these grow slant and slender.

Why, it's the climax of the year,—
  The highest time of living!—
Till naturally its bursting cheer
  Just melts into thanksgiving.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

In "Merry Autumn," Paul Laurence Dunbar utilizes a consistent rhyme scheme of AABBCCDD throughout the poem. The poem is written in four quatrains, each containing four lines. The meter is mostly iambic tetrameter, with lines alternating between eight and nine syllables. This consistent structure gives the poem a rhythmic flow that enhances the playful and lighthearted tone of the piece.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of "Merry Autumn" revolves around the idea of rejecting the traditional somber and melancholic view of autumn in favor of celebrating its vibrant and lively aspects. Dunbar challenges the common perception of autumn as a time of decay and instead presents it as a season filled with joy, laughter, and beauty. The imagery in the poem vividly captures the colors and sensations of autumn, with references to purple tints, blue skies, yellow grasses, and crimson leaves. Nature is personified as a joyful entity, bubbling over with laughter and mirth. The imagery of laughter, playfulness, and abundance throughout the poem reinforces the theme of embracing the joyous spirit of autumn.

### Literary Devices

Dunbar employs several literary devices in "Merry Autumn" to enhance the poem's meaning and tone. Personification is used to give nature human-like qualities, such as laughter and merriment. The use of vivid imagery, such as "purple tints," "crimson leaves," and "sunlight runs along the hills," creates a sensory experience for the reader, bringing the beauty of autumn to life. The contrast between traditional autumn imagery (black and gray) and the vibrant colors described in the poem serves to challenge conventional perceptions of the season. Additionally, the repetition of sounds through alliteration (e.g., "bubbling over with laughter") and consonance (e.g., "sparkling little lasses") adds musicality to the poem.

### Historical and Personal Context

Paul Laurence Dunbar, an African American poet, wrote during a time of significant racial discrimination and social unrest in America. In "Merry Autumn," Dunbar's celebration of the joy and beauty of autumn can be seen as a form of resistance against the prevailing narratives of struggle and oppression. By presenting autumn as a season of abundance, laughter, and cheer, Dunbar may be expressing a desire for hope, renewal, and positivity in the face of adversity. The poem can also be interpreted as a reflection of Dunbar's personal resilience and creativity in the midst of challenging circumstances.

### Deep Reading

At its core, "Merry Autumn" can be viewed as a meditation on the power of perspective and perception. Dunbar challenges the reader to reconsider their preconceived notions of autumn as a season of decline and loss. By reframing autumn as a time of vibrant colors, laughter, and abundance, the poem encourages us to see beauty and joy in unexpected places. The poem's emphasis on the transformative nature of perception suggests that our outlook on life can shape our experience of the world around us. Ultimately, "Merry Autumn" serves as a reminder to approach life with a sense of wonder, gratitude, and openness to the unexpected joys that each season—both literal and metaphorical—has to offer.

## Peace by Rupert Brooke

```
Now, God be thanked Who has watched us with His hour,
And caught our youth, and wakened us from sleeping,
With hand made sure, clear eye, and sharpened power,
To turn, as swimmers into cleanness leaping,
Glad from a world grown old and cold and weary,
Leave the sick hearts that honour could not move,
And half-men, and their dirty songs and dreary,
And all the little emptiness of love!

Oh! we, who have known shame, we have found release there,
Where there's no ill, no grief, but sleep has mending,
Naught broken save this body, lost but breath;
Nothing to shake the laughing heart's long peace there
But only agony, and that has ending;
And the worst friend and enemy is but Death.
```
