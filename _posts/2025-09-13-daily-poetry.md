## Sympathy by Paul Laurence Dunbar

```
I know what the caged bird feels, alas!
When the sun is bright on the upland slopes;
When the wind stirs soft through the springing grass,
And the river flows like a stream of glass;
When the first bird sings and the first bud opes,
And the faint perfume from its chalice steals--
I know what the caged bird feels!

I know why the caged bird beats his wing
Till its blood is red on the cruel bars;
For he must fly back to his perch and cling
When he fain would be on the bough a-swing;
And a pain still throbs in the old, old scars
And they pulse again with a keener sting--
I know why he beats his wing!

I know why the caged bird sings, ah me,
When his wing is bruised and his bosom sore,--
When he beats his bars and he would be free;
It is not a carol of joy or glee,
But a prayer that he sends from his heart's deep core,
But a plea, that upward to Heaven he flings--
I know why the caged bird sings!
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "Sympathy" by Paul Laurence Dunbar is written in three stanzas, each consisting of seven lines. The rhyme scheme is ABABCDC, with the second and fourth lines in each stanza rhyming with each other. The meter is primarily iambic tetrameter, with four metrical feet in each line.

The consistent rhyme scheme and meter create a sense of musicality and rhythm in the poem, enhancing its lyrical quality. The structured form mirrors the confinement of the caged bird, emphasizing the theme of captivity and constraint present throughout the poem.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem is captivity and the longing for freedom. Through vivid imagery, Dunbar portrays the contrast between the freedom of nature and the confinement of the caged bird. The bright sun, soft wind, and flowing river represent the beauty and liberty of the outside world, while the bird's struggle against the bars symbolizes oppression and restriction.

The imagery of the caged bird beating its wings until they bleed evokes a sense of pain and desperation, highlighting the physical and emotional toll of captivity. The bird's song, described as a "prayer" and a "plea," conveys a deep longing for liberation and a yearning to transcend its limitations.

### Literary Devices

Dunbar employs various literary devices to convey the themes of the poem effectively. The repetition of the phrase "I know" at the beginning of each stanza emphasizes the poet's empathy and understanding of the caged bird's plight. This repetition also reinforces the speaker's connection to the bird's suffering.

The use of personification, such as attributing human emotions like "pain" and "prayer" to the bird, adds depth to the poem and humanizes the bird's experience. The metaphor of the caged bird serves as a powerful symbol of oppression and the universal desire for freedom.

Additionally, the alliteration in phrases like "cruel bars" and "springing grass" creates a sense of rhythm and enhances the poem's auditory appeal.

### Historical and Personal Context

Paul Laurence Dunbar, an African American poet writing in the late 19th to early 20th century, often explored themes of race, oppression, and resilience in his work. "Sympathy" can be interpreted as a metaphor for the African American experience during this period, with the caged bird representing the struggle for freedom and equality in a society marked by racial injustice.

As a black poet facing racial discrimination and societal constraints, Dunbar's personal experiences likely influenced his portrayal of the caged bird's yearning for liberation. The poem can be seen as a poignant reflection on the challenges and aspirations of marginalized communities striving for autonomy and empowerment.

### Deep Reading

On a deeper level, "Sympathy" can be interpreted as a universal meditation on the human condition and the innate desire for autonomy and self-expression. The caged bird's relentless struggle against confinement resonates with anyone who has experienced oppression or limitation in any form.

The poem's final lines, "But a plea, that upward to Heaven he flings-- / I know why the caged bird sings," suggest a transcendent hope and resilience in the face of adversity. Despite the bird's physical and emotional wounds, its song becomes a symbol of resilience, defiance, and the enduring human spirit.

In conclusion, "Sympathy" by Paul Laurence Dunbar is a poignant exploration of captivity, longing, and the quest for freedom. Through its evocative imagery, structured form, and powerful literary devices, the poem invites readers to reflect on the universal themes of oppression, resilience, and the enduring power of the human spirit.

## Original Poetry by Victor and Cazire by Percy Bysshe Shelley

```
Here I sit with my paper, my pen and my ink,
First of this thing, and that thing, and t'other thing think;
Then my thoughts come so pell-mell all into my mind,
That the sense or the subject I never can find:
This word is wrong placed,--no regard to the sense,
The present and future, instead of past tense,
Then my grammar I want; O dear! what a bore,
I think I shall never attempt to write more,
With patience I then my thoughts must arraign,
Have them all in due order like mutes in a train,
Like them too must wait in due patience and thought,
Or else my fine works will all come to nought.
My wit too's so copious, it flows like a river,
But disperses its waters on black and white never;
Like smoke it appears independent and free,
But ah luckless smoke! it all passes like thee--
Then at length all my patience entirely lost,
My paper and pens in the fire are tossed;
But come, try again--you must never despair,
Our Murray's or Entick's are not all so rare,
Implore their assistance--they'll come to your aid,
Perform all your business without being paid,
They'll tell you the present tense, future and past,
Which should come first, and which should come last,
This Murray will do--then to Entick repair,
To find out the meaning of any word rare.
This they friendly will tell, and ne'er make you blush,
With a jeering look, taunt, or an O fie! tush!
Then straight all your thoughts in black and white put,
Not minding the if's, the be's, and the but,
Then read it all over, see how it will run,
How answers the wit, the retort, and the pun,
Your writings may then with old Socrates vie,
May on the same shelf with Demosthenes lie,
May as Junius be sharp, or as Plato be sage.
The pattern or satire to all of the age;
But stop--a mad author I mean not to turn,
Nor with thirst of applause does my heated brain burn,
Sufficient that sense, wit, and grammar combined,
My letters may make some slight food for the mind;
That my thoughts to my friends I may freely impart,
In all the warm language that flows from the heart.
Hark! futurity calls! it loudly complains,
It bids me step forward and just hold the reins,
My excuse shall be humble, and faithful, and true,
Such as I fear can be made but by few--
Of writers this age has abundance and plenty,
Three score and a thousand, two millions and twenty,
Three score of them wits who all sharply vie,
To try what odd creature they best can belie,
A thousand are prudes who for CHARITY write,
And fill up their sheets with spleen, envy, and spite[,]
One million are bards, who to Heaven aspire,
And stuff their works full of bombast, rant, and fire,
T'other million are wags who in Grubstreet attend,
And just like a cobbler the old writings mend,
The twenty are those who for pulpits indite,
And pore over sermons all Saturday night.
And now my good friends--who come after I mean,
As I ne'er wore a cassock, or dined with a dean.
Or like cobblers at mending I never did try,
Nor with poets in lyrics attempted to vie;
As for prudes these good souls I both hate and detest,
So here I believe the matter must rest.--
I've heard your complaint--my answer I've made,
And since to your calls all the tribute I've paid,
Adieu my good friend; pray never despair,
But grammar and sense and everything dare,
Attempt but to write dashing, easy, and free,
Then take out your grammar and pay him his fee,
Be not a coward, shrink not to a tense,
But read it all over and make it out sense.
What a tiresome girl!--pray soon make an end,
Else my limited patience you'll quickly expend.
Well adieu, I no longer your patience will try--
So swift to the post now the letter shall fly.
```
