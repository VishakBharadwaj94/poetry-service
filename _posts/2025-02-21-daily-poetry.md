Havin' me to baig you so?

Speak up, Ike, an' 'spress yo'se'f!

## The Bells by Edgar Allan Poe

```
Hear the sledges with the bells--
Silver bells!
What a world of merriment their melody foretells!
How they tinkle, tinkle, tinkle,
In their icy air of night!
While the stars, that oversprinkle
All the heavens, seem to twinkle
With a crystalline delight;
Keeping time, time, time,
In a sort of Runic rhyme,
To the tintinnabulation that so musically wells
From the bells, bells, bells, bells,
Bells, bells, bells--
From the jingling and the tinkling of the bells.

Hear the mellow wedding bells,
Golden bells!
What a world of happiness their harmony foretells!
Through the balmy air of night
How they ring out their delight!
From the molten golden-notes,
And all in tune,
What a liquid ditty floats
To the turtle-dove that listens, while she gloats
On the moon!
Oh, from out the sounding cells,
What a gush of euphony voluminously wells!
How it swells!
How it dwells
On the future! how it tells
Of the rapture that impels
To the swinging and the ringing
Of the bells, bells, bells,
Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,
Bells, bells, bells--
To the rhyming and the chiming of the bells!

Hear the loud alarum bells--
Brazen bells!
What a tale of terror now their turbulency tells!
In the startled ear of night
How they scream out their affright!
Too much horrified to speak,
They can only shriek, shriek,
Out of tune,
In a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire,
In a mad expostulation with the deaf and frantic fire
Leaping higher, higher, higher,
With a desperate desire,
And a resolute endeavor
Now--now to sit or never,
By the side of the pale-faced moon.
Oh, the bells, bells, bells!
What a tale their terror tells
Of Despair!
How they clang, and clash, and roar!
What a horror they outpour
On the bosom of the palpitating air!
Yet the ear it fully knows,
By the twanging,
And the clanging,
How the danger ebbs and flows;
Yet the ear distinctly tells,
In the jangling,
And the wrangling,
How the danger sinks and swells,
By the sinking or the swelling in the anger of the bells--
Of the bells--
Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,
Bells, bells, bells--
In the clamor and the clangor of the bells!

Hear the tolling of the bells--
Iron bells!
What a world of solemn thought their monody compels!
In the silence of the night,
How we shiver with affright
At the melancholy menace of their tone!
For every sound that floats
From the rust within their throats
   Is a groan.
And the people--ah, the people--
They that dwell up in the steeple.
    All alone,
And who tolling, tolling, tolling,
  In that muffled monotone,
Feel a glory in so rolling
  On the human heart a stone--
They are neither man nor woman--
They are neither brute nor human--
    They are Ghouls:
And their king it is who tolls;
And he rolls, rolls, rolls,
         Rolls
A pæan from the bells!
And his merry bosom swells
With the pæan of the bells!
And he dances, and he yells;
Keeping time, time, time,
In a sort of Runic rhyme,
To the pæan of the bells--
    Of the bells:
Keeping time, time, time,
In a sort of Runic rhyme,
  To the throbbing of the bells--
Of the bells, bells, bells--
  To the sobbing of the bells;
Keeping time, time, time,
  As he knells, knells, knells,
In a happy Runic rhyme,
To the rolling of the bells--
Of the bells, bells, bells--
To the tolling of the bells,
Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,
  Bells, bells, bells--
To the moaning and the groaning of the bells.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

"The Bells" by Edgar Allan Poe is a poem composed of four stanzas, each focusing on a different type of bell - silver, golden, brazen, and iron bells. The poem follows a consistent rhyme scheme of ABCBDB, with the second and fourth lines of each stanza rhyming. This rhyme scheme helps create a musical quality that mimics the sound of bells ringing. 

The meter in the poem varies, with Poe using a combination of iambs, anapests, and trochees to create a rhythmic flow that mimics the ringing of bells. For example, in the first stanza, the lines "What a world of merriment their melody foretells!" and "In their icy air of night!" feature a mix of anapests and iambs, adding to the musical quality of the poem.

The structure of the poem reflects the escalating emotions associated with each type of bell, starting with joy and ending with despair. The repetition of the word "bells" throughout the poem serves as a unifying element, reinforcing the central theme of the different emotions evoked by the sound of bells.

### Themes and Imagery

One of the central themes of "The Bells" is the passage of time and the different emotions it can evoke. The poem progresses from the joyous sound of silver bells to the terrifying tolling of iron bells, mirroring the various stages of life from happiness to despair. The imagery of the bells ringing in different scenarios helps convey these emotions vividly to the reader.

Poe's use of sensory imagery, such as the "icy air of night" and the "molten golden-notes," creates a vivid picture in the reader's mind and enhances the emotional impact of the poem. The contrast between the different types of bells, from the cheerful silver bells to the ominous iron bells, further reinforces the theme of the changing nature of life and the emotions it brings.

### Literary Devices

Poe employs several literary devices in "The Bells" to enhance the poem's musicality and emotional depth. The most prominent device is onomatopoeia, with words like "tinkle," "clang," and "groan" mimicking the sounds of bells ringing. This use of onomatopoeia adds to the sensory experience of the poem and helps create a visceral connection with the reader.

Repetition is another key literary device in the poem, with the word "bells" being repeated throughout each stanza. This repetition serves to emphasize the central theme of the poem and create a sense of rhythm that mirrors the ringing of bells. Additionally, Poe uses alliteration and internal rhyme to further enhance the musical quality of the poem.

### Historical and Personal Context

"The Bells" was written by Edgar Allan Poe in 1848 and was published posthumously in 1849. At the time of its composition, Poe was facing personal struggles, including the illness and subsequent death of his wife Virginia. This context of personal loss and despair likely influenced the somber tone of the later stanzas in the poem, which depict the tolling of iron bells and the sense of impending doom.

Historically, the poem can be seen as a reflection of the broader themes of change and mortality prevalent in the 19th century. The Industrial Revolution brought about significant societal and technological advancements but also led to increased urbanization and social upheaval. The different types of bells in the poem can be interpreted as symbols of these changing times and the complex emotions they evoked.

### Deep Reading

"The Bells" can be interpreted as a meditation on the passage of time and the cyclical nature of life. The progression from the joyful sound of silver bells to the ominous tolling of iron bells reflects the inevitable journey from happiness to despair that all individuals must face. The poem's repetitive structure and use of sensory imagery create a sense of inevitability, mirroring the relentless march of time and the emotions it brings.

Furthermore, the shifting tones and emotions in each stanza can be seen as a metaphor for the stages of human experience, from innocence and joy to fear and despair. By using the imagery of bells ringing in different contexts, Poe captures the full range of human emotions and experiences, ultimately reminding the reader of the transient nature of life and the inevitability of change.

## "Faithful to the end" Amended by Emily Dickinson

```
"Faithful to the end" Amended
From the Heavenly Clause --
Constancy with a Proviso
Constancy abhors --

"Crowns of Life" are servile Prizes
To the stately Heart,
Given for the Giving, solely,
No Emolument.

--

"Faithful to the end" Amended
From the Heavenly clause --
Lucrative indeed the offer
But the Heart withdraws --

"I will give" the base Proviso --
Spare Your "Crown of Life" --
Those it fits, too fair to wear it --
Try it on Yourself --
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "Faithful to the end" Amended by Emily Dickinson consists of two stanzas, each with four lines. The poem follows a consistent ABAB rhyme scheme in both stanzas. In terms of meter, the poem does not strictly adhere to a specific meter like iambic pentameter but instead flows with a rhythmic quality that enhances the poem's musicality. The structure of the poem is concise and compact, with each stanza presenting a complete thought.

### Themes and Imagery

One of the central themes of the poem is faithfulness or constancy, explored through the metaphor of a "Crown of Life" as a reward for loyalty. The speaker suggests that true constancy does not seek external rewards or recognition, as seen in the line "Given for the Giving, solely, No Emolument." The imagery of the "Crowns of Life" as "servile Prizes" and the hesitation to accept them due to a "base Proviso" highlights the idea of integrity and staying true to one's principles regardless of potential rewards.

### Literary Devices

Dickinson employs various literary devices to enhance the poem's meaning and impact. The use of alliteration in phrases like "Constancy with a Proviso" and "Lucrative indeed the offer" emphasizes key ideas and creates a rhythmic flow. The repetition of the phrase "Faithful to the end" throughout the poem serves as a refrain, underscoring the theme of loyalty. The metaphor of the "Crowns of Life" symbolizes rewards or honors, while the image of trying on the crown oneself suggests personal accountability and integrity.

### Historical and Personal Context

Emily Dickinson's poetry often delves into themes of faith, mortality, and the human experience. As a reclusive poet who grappled with questions of spirituality and existence, Dickinson's work often reflects her introspective nature and keen observations of the world around her. This poem can be seen as a reflection of Dickinson's own thoughts on loyalty, integrity, and the true nature of rewards in life.

### Deep Reading

In a deeper analysis of the poem, Dickinson seems to challenge conventional ideas of loyalty and reward. The speaker questions the true value of external accolades, suggesting that genuine faithfulness comes from within and does not seek validation or material gain. By rejecting the "Crowns of Life" and the "base Proviso," the speaker asserts the importance of staying true to one's principles even in the face of tempting offers. The poem ultimately encourages readers to consider the true meaning of faithfulness and the rewards that come from staying steadfast in one's beliefs.
