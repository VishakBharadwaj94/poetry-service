## A Musical Instrument by Elizabeth Barrett Browning

```
What was he doing, the great god Pan,
Down in the reeds by the river?
Spreading ruin and scattering ban,
Splashing and paddling with hoofs of a goat,
And breaking the golden lilies afloat
With the dragon-fly on the river.

He tore out a reed, the great god Pan,
From the deep cool bed of the river:
The limpid water turbidly ran,
And the broken lilies a-dying lay,
And the dragon-fly had fled away,
Ere he brought it out of the river.

High on the shore sat the great god Pan,
While turbidly flowed the river;
And hacked and hewed as a great god can,
With his hard bleak steel at the patient reed,
Till there was not a sign of the leaf indeed
To prove it fresh from the river.

He cut it short, did the great god Pan,
(How tall it stood in the river!)
Then drew the pith, like the heart of a man,
Steadily from the outside ring,
And notched the poor dry empty thing
In holes, as he sat by the river.

"This is the way," laughed the great god Pan,
(Laughed while he sat by the river)
"The only way, since gods began
To make sweet music, they could succeed."
Then, dropping his mouth to a hole in the reed,
He blew in power by the river.

Sweet, sweet, sweet, O Pan!
Piercing sweet by the river!
Blinding sweet, O great god Pan!
The sun on the hill forgot to die,
And the lilies revived, and the dragon-fly
Came back to dream on the river.

Yet half a beast is the great god Pan,
To laugh as he sits by the river,
Making a poet out of a man:
The true gods sigh for the cost and painâ€”
For the reed which grows nevermore again
As a reed with the reeds in the river.
```

In "A Musical Instrument," Elizabeth Barrett Browning employs a structured and consistent form throughout the poem. The poem consists of three stanzas, each with a varying number of lines. The first stanza has 8 lines, the second stanza has 7 lines, and the final stanza has 9 lines. This shifting structure mirrors the progression of the god Pan's actions as he creates music from a reed by the river.

The poem does not strictly adhere to a specific meter, but it flows smoothly with a lyrical quality, enhancing the musical theme of the poem. Browning uses a mix of iambic and trochaic rhythms, creating a dynamic and engaging cadence. The rhyme scheme of the poem is ABABCCDDE in the first stanza, ABABCCE in the second stanza, and ABABCDDCE in the final stanza, providing a sense of closure and resolution at the end of the poem.

### Themes and Imagery

One of the central themes of the poem is the transformative power of art and music. Through the figure of the god Pan, Browning explores the process of creation and the beauty that can emerge from destruction. Pan's actions of cutting, hollowing out, and playing the reed symbolize the artistic journey of shaping raw materials into something harmonious and beautiful.

Imagery plays a crucial role in conveying the themes of the poem. Browning vividly describes Pan's actions in nature, such as "spreading ruin and scattering ban" and "breaking the golden lilies afloat." The imagery of the river, reeds, dragonflies, and lilies creates a vivid and sensory-rich landscape that enhances the mystical and enchanting atmosphere of the poem.

### Literary Devices

Browning employs several literary devices to enhance the poem's meaning and mood. One notable device is personification, as she attributes human-like qualities to the god Pan, portraying him as a creative and playful figure. The use of imagery, particularly nature imagery, adds depth and symbolism to the poem, emphasizing the interconnectedness between art and the natural world.

Another literary device Browning utilizes is symbolism. The reed transformed by Pan symbolizes the potential for beauty and artistry to emerge from the mundane and ordinary. The reed becomes a metaphor for the poet's creative process, highlighting the transformative power of artistic expression.

### Historical and Personal Context

Elizabeth Barrett Browning was a prominent Victorian poet known for her exploration of themes such as love, nature, and social justice. "A Musical Instrument" was published in 1862 and reflects Browning's interest in mythology and classical themes. The figure of Pan, a Greek god associated with nature and music, serves as a symbol of artistic inspiration and creativity in the poem.

Browning's personal experiences, including her struggles with chronic illness and her deep love for her husband, the poet Robert Browning, likely influenced her exploration of themes related to transformation and beauty in "A Musical Instrument." The poem can be seen as a reflection of Browning's own artistic process and the power of art to transcend pain and adversity.

### Deep Reading

At its core, "A Musical Instrument" is a meditation on the nature of creativity and the sacrifices that artists must make to bring beauty into the world. The god Pan's laughter and transformation of the reed into a musical instrument symbolize the artist's ability to create something meaningful and enduring out of the ordinary and fleeting.

The poem also raises questions about the cost of artistic creation and the dual nature of inspiration. While Pan's music is described as "sweet, sweet, sweet," his hybrid nature as "half a beast" suggests that artistry is often accompanied by a sense of loss and longing. The final lines of the poem, with the reed "which grows nevermore again," evoke a sense of melancholy and the ephemeral nature of art itself.

Overall, "A Musical Instrument" invites readers to contemplate the transformative power of art, the complexities of the creative process, and the enduring legacy of beauty in a world filled with impermanence and change.

## A Pretty Woman by Robert Browning

```
That fawn-skin-dappled hair of hers,
    And the blue eye
    Dear and dewy,
And that infantine fresh air of hers!

To think men cannot take you, Sweet,
    And infold you,
    Ay, and hold you,
And so keep you what they make you, Sweet!

You like us for a glance, you know--
    For a word's sake
    Or a sword's sake:
All's the same, whate'er the chance, you know.

And in turn we make you ours, we say--
    You and youth too,
    Eyes and mouth too,
All the face composed of flowers, we say.

All's our own, to make the most of, Sweet--
    Sing and say for,
    Watch and pray for,
Keep a secret or go boast of, Sweet!

But for loving, why, you would not, Sweet,
    Tho' we prayed you,
    Paid you, brayed you
In a mortar--for you could not, Sweet!

So, we leave the sweet face fondly there,
    Be its beauty
    Its sole duty!
Let all hope of grace beyond, lie there!

And while the face lies quiet there,
    Who shall wonder
    That I ponder
A conclusion? I will try it there.

As,--why must one, for the love foregone
    Scout mere liking?
    Thunder-striking
Earth,--the heaven, we looked above for, gone!

Why, with beauty, needs there money be,
    Love with liking?
    Crush the fly-king
In his gauze, because no honey-bee?

May not liking be so simple-sweet,
    If love grew there
    'Twould undo there
All that breaks the cheek to dimples sweet?

Is the creature too imperfect, say?
    Would you mend it
    And so end it?
Since not all addition perfects aye!

Or is it of its kind, perhaps,
    Just perfection--
    Whence, rejection
Of a grace not to its mind, perhaps?

Shall we burn up, tread that face at once
    Into tinder,
    And so hinder
Sparks from kindling all the place at once?

Or else kiss away one's soul on her?
    Your love-fancies!
    --A sick man sees
Truer, when his hot eyes roll on her!

Thus the craftsman thinks to grace the rose,--
    Plucks a mould-flower
    For his gold flower,
Uses fine things that efface the rose.

Rosy rubies make its cup more rose.
    Precious metals
    Ape the petals,--
Last, some old king locks it up, morose!

Then how grace a rose? I know a way!
    Leave it, rather.
    Must you gather?
Smell, kiss, wear it--at last, throw away.
```

## Adlestrop by Edward Thomas

```
YES. I remember Adlestrop--
The name, because one afternoon
Of heat the express-train drew up there
Unwontedly. It was late June.

The steam hissed. Someone cleared his throat.
No one left and no one came
On the bare platform. What I saw
Was Adlestrop--only the name

And willows, willow-herb, and grass,
And meadowsweet, and haycocks dry,
No whit less still and lonely fair
Than the high cloudlets in the sky.

And for that minute a blackbird sang
Close by, and round him, mistier,
Farther and farther, all the birds
Of Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire.
```
