## Strayed Reveller, The by Matthew Arnold

```
The Youth

Faster, faster,
O Circe, Goddess,
Let the wild, thronging train
The bright procession
Of eddying forms,
Sweep through my soul!
Thou standest, smiling
Down on me! thy right arm,
Lean'd up against the column there,
Props thy soft cheek;
Thy left holds, hanging loosely,
The deep cup, ivy-cinctured,
I held but now.
Is it, then, evening
So soon? I see, the night-dews,
Cluster'd in thick beads, dim
The agate brooch-stones
On thy white shoulder;
The cool night-wind, too,
Blows through the portico,
Stirs thy hair, Goddess,
Waves thy white robe!


Circe.

Whence art thou, sleeper?


The Youth.

When the white dawn first
Through the rough fir-planks
Of my hut, by the chestnuts,
Up at the valley-head,
Came breaking, Goddess!
I sprang up, I threw round me
My dappled fawn-skin;
Passing out, from the wet turf,
Where they lay, by the hut door,
I snatch'd up my vine-crown, my fir-staff,
All drench'd in dew-
Came swift down to join
The rout early gather'd
In the town, round the temple,
Iacchus' white fane
On yonder hill.
Quick I pass'd, following
The wood-cutters' cart-track
Down the dark valley;-I saw
On my left, through the beeches,
Thy palace, Goddess,
Smokeless, empty!
Trembling, I enter'd; beheld
The court all silent,
The lions sleeping,
On the altar this bowl.
I drank, Goddess!
And sank down here, sleeping,
On the steps of thy portico.


Circe.

Foolish boy! Why tremblest thou?
Thou lovest it, then, my wine?
Wouldst more of it? See, how glows,
Through the delicate, flush'd marble,
The red, creaming liquor,
Strown with dark seeds!
Drink, thee! I chide thee not,
Deny thee not my bowl.
Come, stretch forth thy hand, thee-so!
Drink-drink again!


The Youth.

Thanks, gracious one!
Ah, the sweet fumes again!
More soft, ah me,
More subtle-winding
Than Pan's flute-music!
Faint-faint! Ah me,
Again the sweet sleep!


Circe.

Hist! Thou-within there!
Come forth, Ulysses!
Art tired with hunting?
While we range the woodland,
See what the day brings.


Ulysses.

Ever new magic!
Hast thou then lured hither,
Wonderful Goddess, by thy art,
The young, languid-eyed Ampelus,
Iacchus' darling-
Or some youth beloved of Pan,
Of Pan and the Nymphs?
That he sits, bending downward
His white, delicate neck
To the ivy-wreathed marge
Of thy cup; the bright, glancing vine-leaves
That crown his hair,
Falling forward, mingling
With the dark ivy-plants--
His fawn-skin, half untied,
Smear'd with red wine-stains? Who is he,
That he sits, overweigh'd
By fumes of wine and sleep,
So late, in thy portico?
What youth, Goddess,-what guest
Of Gods or mortals?


Circe.

Hist! he wakes!
I lured him not hither, Ulysses.
Nay, ask him!


The Youth.

Who speaks' Ah, who comes forth
To thy side, Goddess, from within?
How shall I name him?
This spare, dark-featured,
Quick-eyed stranger?
Ah, and I see too
His sailor's bonnet,
His short coat, travel-tarnish'd,
With one arm bare!--
Art thou not he, whom fame
This long time rumours
The favour'd guest of Circe, brought by the waves?
Art thou he, stranger?
The wise Ulysses,
Laertes' son?


Ulysses.

I am Ulysses.
And thou, too, sleeper?
Thy voice is sweet.
It may be thou hast follow'd
Through the islands some divine bard,
By age taught many things,
Age and the Muses;
And heard him delighting
The chiefs and people
In the banquet, and learn'd his songs.
Of Gods and Heroes,
Of war and arts,
And peopled cities,
Inland, or built
By the gray sea.-If so, then hail!
I honour and welcome thee.


The Youth.

The Gods are happy.
They turn on all sides
Their shining eyes,
And see below them
The earth and men.
They see Tiresias
Sitting, staff in hand,
On the warm, grassy
Asopus bank,
His robe drawn over
His old sightless head,
Revolving inly
The doom of Thebes.
They see the Centaurs
In the upper glens
Of Pelion, in the streams,
Where red-berried ashes fringe
The clear-brown shallow pools,
With streaming flanks, and heads
Rear'd proudly, snuffing
The mountain wind.
They see the Indian
Drifting, knife in hand,
His frail boat moor'd to
A floating isle thick-matted
With large-leaved, low-creeping melon-plants
And the dark cucumber.
He reaps, and stows them,
Drifting--drifting;--round him,
Round his green harvest-plot,
Flow the cool lake-waves,
The mountains ring them.
They see the Scythian
On the wide stepp, unharnessing
His wheel'd house at noon.
He tethers his beast down, and makes his meal--
Mares' milk, and bread
Baked on the embers;--all around
The boundless, waving grass-plains stretch, thick-starr'd
With saffron and the yellow hollyhock
And flag-leaved iris-flowers.
Sitting in his cart
He makes his meal; before him, for long miles,
Alive with bright green lizards,
And the springing bustard-fowl,
The track, a straight black line,
Furrows the rich soil; here and there
Cluster of lonely mounds
Topp'd with rough-hewn,
Gray, rain-blear'd statues, overpeer
The sunny waste.
They see the ferry
On the broad, clay-laden
Lone Chorasmian stream;--thereon,
With snort and strain,
Two horses, strongly swimming, tow
The ferry-boat, with woven ropes
To either bow
Firm harness'd by the mane; a chief
With shout and shaken spear,
Stands at the prow, and guides them; but astern
The cowering merchants, in long robes,
Sit pale beside their wealth
Of silk-bales and of balsam-drops,
Of gold and ivory,
Of turquoise-earth and amethyst,
Jasper and chalcedony,
And milk-barred onyx-stones.
The loaded boat swings groaning
In the yellow eddies;
The Gods behold him.
They see the Heroes
Sitting in the dark ship
On the foamless, long-heaving
Violet sea.
At sunset nearing
The Happy Islands.
These things, Ulysses,
The wise bards, also
Behold and sing.
But oh, what labour!
O prince, what pain!
They too can see
Tiresias;--but the Gods,
Who give them vision,
Added this law:
That they should bear too
His groping blindness,
His dark foreboding,
His scorn'd white hairs;
Bear Hera's anger
Through a life lengthen'd
To seven ages.
They see the Centaurs
On Pelion:--then they feel,
They too, the maddening wine
Swell their large veins to bursting; in wild pain
They feel the biting spears
Of the grim Lapithж, and Theseus, drive,
Drive crashing through their bones; they feel
High on a jutting rock in the red stream
Alcmena's dreadful son
Ply his bow;--such a price
The Gods exact for song:
To become what we sing.
They see the Indian
On his mountain lake; but squalls
Make their skiff reel, and worms
In the unkind spring have gnawn
Their melon-harvest to the heart.--They see
The Scythian: but long frosts
Parch them in winter-time on the bare stepp,
Till they too fade like grass; they crawl
Like shadows forth in spring.
They see the merchants
On the Oxus stream;--but care
Must visit first them too, and make them pale.
Whether, through whirling sand,
A cloud of desert robber-horse have burst
Upon their caravan; or greedy kings,
In the wall'd cities the way passes through,
Crush'd them with tolls; or fever-airs,
On some great river's marge,
Mown them down, far from home.
They see the Heroes
Near harbour;--but they share
Their lives, and former violent toil in Thebes,
Seven-gated Thebes, or Troy;
Or where the echoing oars
Of Argo first
Startled the unknown sea.
The old Silenus
Came, lolling in the sunshine,
From the dewy forest-coverts,
This way at noon.
Sitting by me, while his Fauns
Down at the water-side
Sprinkled and smoothed
His drooping garland,
He told me these things.
But I, Ulysses,
Sitting on the warm steps,
Looking over the valley,
All day long, have seen,
Without pain, without labour,
Sometimes a wild-hair'd Mжnad--
Sometimes a Faun with torches--
And sometimes, for a moment,
Passing through the dark stems
Flowing-robed, the beloved,
The desired, the divine,
Beloved Iacchus.
Ah, cool night-wind, tremulous stars!
Ah, glimmering water,
Fitful earth-murmur,
Dreaming woods!
Ah, golden-haired, strangely smiling Goddess,
And thou, proved, much enduring,
Wave-toss'd Wanderer!
Who can stand still?
Ye fade, ye swim, ye waver before me--
The cup again!
Faster, faster,
O Circe, Goddess.
Let the wild, thronging train,
The bright procession
Of eddying forms,
Sweep through my soul!
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme
The poem "The Strayed Reveller" by Matthew Arnold is written in blank verse, which means it does not have a regular rhyme scheme or meter. The lack of rhyme and meter adds to the free-flowing, dream-like quality of the poem, mirroring the intoxicated state of the characters. The poem is structured as a conversation between three characters: The Youth, Circe, and Ulysses. Each character speaks in turn, contributing to the progression of the narrative.

### Themes and Imagery
The central themes of the poem revolve around indulgence, temptation, and the consequences of succumbing to desire. The imagery in the poem is vivid and sensory, invoking a sense of intoxication and hedonism. The descriptions of Circe's palace, the wine, and the characters' physical reactions to the substances they consume create a lush and immersive atmosphere. The references to Greek mythology add layers of meaning, as Circe is a figure known for her ability to transform men into animals through her potions.

### Literary Devices
Arnold employs various literary devices in the poem to enhance its themes and imagery. Personification is used when Circe is described as smiling and speaking, giving her a sense of agency and power. Allusion is present in the references to Greek mythology, particularly in the character of Ulysses, who is a legendary figure known for his cunning and endurance. Symbolism is evident in the wine and the effects it has on the characters, representing indulgence and escapism. The repetition of phrases like "faster, faster" and "drink, drink again" creates a sense of urgency and desire.

### Historical and Personal Context
Matthew Arnold was a Victorian poet and critic known for his introspective and philosophical works. "The Strayed Reveller" was published in 1849, a time of social and political change in England. The poem reflects Arnold's interest in classical literature and his exploration of themes such as the conflict between reason and emotion. The poem can also be seen as a commentary on the dangers of excess and the consequences of losing oneself to pleasure.

### Deep Reading
A deeper analysis of the poem reveals a critique of hedonism and escapism. The characters, particularly The Youth, are consumed by their desires and substances, leading to a loss of control and self-awareness. Circe represents the temptations of indulgence and the allure of surrendering to pleasure. Ulysses serves as a voice of reason and wisdom, cautioning against the dangers of giving in to temptation. The poem ultimately serves as a cautionary tale about the consequences of straying from the path of moderation and self-control. It also explores the cyclical nature of indulgence and the transient nature of pleasure.

## At Home by Christina Rossetti

```
When I was dead, my spirit turned
To seek the much-frequented house:
I passed the door, and saw my friends
Feasting beneath green orange boughs;
From hand to hand they pushed the wine,
They sucked the pulp of plum and peach;
They sang, they jested, and they laughed,
For each was loved of each.

I listened to thier honest chat:
Said one: "To-morrow we shall be
Plod plod along the featureless sands,
And coasting miles and miles of sea."
Said one: "Before the turn of tide
We will achieve the eyrie-seat."
Said one: "To-morrow shall be like
To-day, but much more sweet."

"To-morrow," said they, strong with hope,
And dwelt upon the pleasant way:
"To-morrow," cried they, one and all,
While no one spoke of yesterday.
Their life stood full at blessed noon;
I, only I, had passed away:
"To-morrow and to-day," they cried;
I was of yesterday.

I shivered comfortless, but cast
No chill across the table-cloth;
I, all-forgotten, shivered, sad
To stay, and yet to part how loth:
I passed from the familiar room,
I who from love had passed away,
Like the remembrance of a guest
That tarrieth but a day.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme
In terms of form, Christina Rossetti's poem "At Home" consists of six stanzas, each with four lines. The poem follows a consistent rhyme scheme of ABAB, with alternating end rhymes in each quatrain. The meter is predominantly iambic tetrameter, with four stressed syllables in each line.

### Themes and Imagery
The central theme of the poem revolves around the concept of mortality and the passage of time. The speaker, who is dead, observes their friends enjoying life and looking forward to the future, while they are left behind in the past. The imagery of the friends feasting beneath green orange boughs and discussing their plans for the future creates a vivid contrast with the speaker's sense of isolation and detachment.

### Literary Devices
Rossetti employs various literary devices to convey the themes of the poem. One notable device is personification, as the speaker's spirit is depicted as actively seeking out familiar scenes and observing the actions of the living. The repetition of the word "To-morrow" emphasizes the friends' optimism and contrasts it with the speaker's sense of being stuck in the past. Additionally, the use of simile in comparing the speaker to "the remembrance of a guest that tarrieth but a day" highlights their transient existence.

### Historical and Personal Context
Christina Rossetti was a Victorian poet known for her introspective and melancholic themes. "At Home" reflects the Victorian preoccupation with mortality and the fleeting nature of life. Rossetti's own experiences of loss and illness likely influenced her exploration of themes related to death and memory in this poem.

### Deep Reading
The poem "At Home" delves into the poignant experience of feeling disconnected from the present moment and longing for the past. The speaker's ghostly presence at the feast highlights the bittersweet nature of memory and the inevitability of being forgotten as time passes. The contrast between the friends' lively conversations about the future and the speaker's sense of being left behind evokes a profound sense of isolation and longing. Ultimately, the poem serves as a meditation on the transient nature of life and the enduring power of memory.

## The Heretic's Tragedy: A Middle-Age Interlude by Robert Browning

```
The Lord, we look to once for all,
        Is the Lord we should look at, all at once:
He knows not to vary, saith Saint Paul,
        Nor the shadow of turning, for the nonce.
See him no other than as he is!
        Give both the infinitudes their due--
Infinite mercy, but, I wis,
        As infinite a justice too.

As infinite a justice too.

John, Master of the Temple of God,
        Falling to sin the Unknown Sin,
What he bought of Emperor Aldabrod,
        He sold it to Sultan Saladin:
Till, caught by Pope Clement, a-buzzing there,
        Hornet-prince of the mad wasps' hive,
And clipt of his wings in Paris square,
        They bring him now to be burned alive.
                        [And wanteth there grace of lute or
                                clavicithern, ye shall say to
                                confirm him who singeth--
        We bring John now to be burned alive.

In the midst is a goodly gallows built;
        'Twixt fork and fork, a stake is stuck;
But first they set divers tumbrils a-tilt,
        Make a trench all round with the city muck;
Inside they pile log upon log, good store;
        Faggots no few, blocks great and small,
Reach a man's mid-thigh, no less, no more,--
        For they mean he should roast in the sight of all.

        We mean he should roast in the sight of all.

Good sappy bavins that kindle forthwith;
        Billets that blaze substantial and slow;
Pine-stump split deftly, dry as pith;
        Larch-heart that chars to a chalk-white glow:
They up they hoist me John in a chafe,
        Sling him fast like a hog to scorch,
Spit in his face, then leap back safe,
Sing "Laudes" and bid clap-to the torch.

        Laus deo--who bids clap-to the torch.

John of the Temple, whose fame so bragged,
        Is burning alive in Paris square!
How can he curse, if his mouth is gagged?
        Or wriggle his neck, with a collar there?
Or heave his chest, which a band goes round?
        Or threat with his fist, since his arms are spliced?
Or kick with his feet, now his legs are bound?
        --Thinks John, I will call upon Jesus Christ.

Jesus Christ--John had bought and sold,
        Jesus Christ--John had eaten and drunk;
To him, the Flesh meant silver and gold.
        (Salva reverentia.)
Now it was, "Saviour, bountiful lamb,
        "I have roasted thee Turks, though men roast me!
"See thy servant, the plight wherein I am!
        "Art thou a saviour? Save thou me!"

       'Tis John the mocker cries, "Save thou me!"

Who maketh God's menace an idle word?
        --Saith, it no more means what it proclaims,
Than a damsel's threat to her wanton bird?
        For she too prattles of ugly names.
--Saith, he knoweth but one thing--what he knows?
        That God is good and the rest is breath;
Why else is the same styled Sharon's rose?
        Once a rose, ever a rose, he saith.

        O, John shall yet find a rose, he saith!

Alack, there be roses and roses, John!
        Some, honied of taste like your leman's  tongue:
Some, bitter; for why? (roast gaily on!)
        Their tree struck root in devil's-dung.
When Paul once reasoned of righteousness
        And of temperance and of judgment to come,
Good Felix trembled, he could no less:
        John, snickering, crook'd his wicked thumb.

        What cometh to John of the wicked thumb?

Ha ha, John plucketh now at his rose
        To rid himself of a sorrow at heart!
Lo,--petal on petal, fierce rays unclose;
        Anther on anther, sharp spikes outstart;
And with blood for dew, the bosom boils;
        And a gust of sulphur is all its smell;
And lo, he is horribly in the toils
        Of a coal-black giant flower of hell!

        What maketh heaven, That maketh hell.

So, as John called now, through the fire amain,
        On the Name, he had cursed with, all his life--
To the Person, he bought and sold again--
        For the Face, with his daily buffets rife--
Feature by feature It took its place:
        And his voice, like a mad dog's choking bark,
At the steady whole of the Judge's face--
        Died. Forth John's soul flared into the dark.

        God help all poor souls lost in the dark!
```

There is a use of alliteration in phrases like "Sling him fast like a hog to scorch" and "Feature by feature It took its place," which adds to the rhythmic quality of the poem. The repetition of phrases such as "We mean he should roast in the sight of all" and "O, John shall yet find a rose, he saith" emphasizes key ideas and themes. Additionally, there is imagery such as "gust of sulphur" and "coal-black giant flower of hell" that evoke a sense of dread and horror.

### Historical and Personal Context

The poem reflects the historical context of the Middle Ages, a time when heresy was a serious offense punishable by death. The references to Pope Clement, Sultan Saladin, and Emperor Aldabrod ground the narrative in a specific historical setting. Browning's exploration of the conflict between faith and worldly desires resonates with broader themes of sin, repentance, and salvation.

### Deep Reading

At its core, "The Heretic's Tragedy" delves into the complex nature of human morality and the consequences of straying from one's beliefs. John's journey from mockery and greed to a desperate plea for salvation highlights the transformative power of facing one's sins. The juxtaposition of the divine and the diabolical in the imagery of the rose and the giant flower of hell speaks to the eternal struggle between good and evil within the individual soul. Ultimately, the poem serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of spiritual corruption and the possibility of redemption through sincere repentance.
