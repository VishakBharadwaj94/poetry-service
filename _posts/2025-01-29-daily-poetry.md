## When We Two Walked by Edward Thomas

```
WHEN we two walked in Lent
We imagined that happiness
Was something different
And this was something less.

But happy were we to hide
Our happiness, not as they were
Who acted in their pride
Juno and Jupiter:

For the Gods in their jealousy
Murdered that wife and man,
And we that were wise live free
To recall our happiness then.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "When We Two Walked" by Edward Thomas consists of a single stanza with ten lines. The structure is free verse, without a specific rhyme scheme or meter. This lack of strict form reflects the casual, conversational tone of the poem, allowing the reader to focus on the content and emotions conveyed.

### Themes and Imagery

The poem explores the theme of happiness and perception. In the first stanza, the speaker reflects on a past moment when they were happy but did not fully realize it at the time. The imagery of walking together during Lent creates a sense of introspection and reflection. The comparison to Juno and Jupiter, mythological figures who experienced jealousy and tragedy, further emphasizes the theme of appreciating happiness in the present moment.

### Literary Devices

Thomas uses allusion to Greek mythology with the mention of Juno and Jupiter, adding depth to the poem by drawing parallels between the speaker's experience and the tragic fate of the gods. The use of personification is seen in the line "For the Gods in their jealousy," giving human-like qualities to the gods. The repetition of the word "happiness" throughout the poem serves to highlight its importance and the speaker's contemplation of its true nature.

### Historical and Personal Context

Edward Thomas was a British poet who wrote during the early 20th century, a time marked by war and social change. This context may influence the themes of reflection, appreciation, and the fleeting nature of happiness in the poem. Thomas himself experienced personal struggles and uncertainty, which could have informed his exploration of these themes in his work.

### Deep Reading

The poem delves into the complexities of happiness and perception, suggesting that true happiness may not always be recognized in the moment. The reference to Juno and Jupiter serves as a cautionary tale, highlighting the destructive nature of jealousy and pride. By contrasting this myth with the speaker's own experience of hidden happiness, Thomas prompts readers to reflect on their own understanding of joy and fulfillment. The poem invites introspection and a deeper appreciation for the simple moments of happiness that may go unnoticed in the busyness of life.

## Moonlight, summer moonlight by Emily Bronte

```
'Tis moonlight, summer moonlight,
All soft and still and fair;
The solemn hour of midnight
Breathes sweet thoughts everywhere,

But most where trees are sending
Their breezy boughs on high,
Or stooping low are lending
A shelter from the sky.

And there in those wild bowers
A lovely form is laid;
Green grass and dew-steeped flowers
Wave gently round her head.
```

## The Devil's Walk. a Ballad by Percy Bysshe Shelley

```
Once, early in the morning, Beelzebub arose,
With care his sweet person adorning,
He put on his Sunday clothes.

He drew on a boot to hide his hoof,
He drew on a glove to hide his claw,
His horns were concealed by a Bras Chapeau,
And the Devil went forth as natty a Beau
As Bond-street ever saw.

He sate him down, in London town,
Before earth's morning ray;
With a favourite imp he began to chat,
On religion, and scandal, this and that,
Until the dawn of day.

And then to St. James's Court he went,
And St. Paul's Church he took on his way;
He was mighty thick with every Saint,
Though they were formal and he was gay.

The Devil was an agriculturist,
And as bad weeds quickly grow,
In looking over his farm, I wist,
He wouldn't find cause for woe.

He peeped in each hole, to each chamber stole,
His promising live-stock to view;
Grinning applause, he just showed them his claws,
And they shrunk with affright from his ugly sight,
Whose work they delighted to do.

Satan poked his red nose into crannies so small
One would think that the innocents fair,
Poor lambkins! were just doing nothing at all
But settling some dress or arranging some ball,
But the Devil saw deeper there.

A Priest, at whose elbow the Devil during prayer
Sate familiarly, side by side,
Declared that, if the Tempter were there,
His presence he would not abide.
Ah! ah! thought Old Nick, that's a very stale trick,
For without the Devil, O favourite of Evil,
In your carriage you would not ride.

Satan next saw a brainless King,
Whose house was as hot as his own;
Many Imps in attendance were there on the wing,
They flapped the pennon and twisted the sting,
Close by the very Throne.

Ah! ah! thought Satan, the pasture is good,
My Cattle will here thrive better than others;
They dine on news of human blood,
They sup on the groans of the dying and dead,
And supperless never will go to bed;
Which will make them fat as their brothers.

Fat as the Fiends that feed on blood,
Fresh and warm from the fields of Spain,
Where Ruin ploughs her gory way,
Where the shoots of earth are nipped in the bud,
Where Hell is the Victor's prey,
Its glory the meed of the slain.

Fat--as the Death-birds on Erin's shore,
That glutted themselves in her dearest gore,
And flitted round Castlereagh,
When they snatched the Patriot's heart, that HIS grasp
Had torn from its widow's maniac clasp,
--And fled at the dawn of day.

Fat--as the Reptiles of the tomb,
That riot in corruption's spoil,
That fret their little hour in gloom,
And creep, and live the while.

Fat as that Prince's maudlin brain,
Which, addled by some gilded toy,
Tired, gives his sweetmeat, and again
Cries for it, like a humoured boy.

For he is fat,--his waistcoat gay,
When strained upon a levee day,
Scarce meets across his princely paunch;
And pantaloons are like half-moons
Upon each brawny haunch.

How vast his stock of calf! when plenty
Had filled his empty head and heart,
Enough to satiate foplings twenty,
Could make his pantaloon seams start.

The Devil (who sometimes is called Nature),
For men of power provides thus well,
Whilst every change and every feature,
Their great original can tell.

Satan saw a lawyer a viper slay,
That crawled up the leg of his table,
It reminded him most marvellously
Of the story of Cain and Abel.

The wealthy yeoman, as he wanders
His fertile fields among,
And on his thriving cattle ponders,
Counts his sure gains, and hums a song;
Thus did the Devil, through earth walking,
Hum low a hellish song.

For they thrive well whose garb of gore
Is Satan's choicest livery,
And they thrive well who from the poor
Have snatched the bread of penury,
And heap the houseless wanderer's store
On the rank pile of luxury.

The Bishops thrive, though they are big;
The Lawyers thrive, though they are thin;
For every gown, and every wig,
Hides the safe thrift of Hell within.

Thus pigs were never counted clean,
Although they dine on finest corn;
And cormorants are sin-like lean,
Although they eat from night to morn.

Oh! why is the Father of Hell in such glee,
As he grins from ear to ear?
Why does he doff his clothes joyfully,
As he skips, and prances, and flaps his wing,
As he sidles, leers, and twirls his sting,
And dares, as he is, to appear?

A statesman passed--alone to him,
The Devil dare his whole shape uncover,
To show each feature, every limb,
Secure of an unchanging lover.

At this known sign, a welcome sight,
The watchful demons sought their King,
And every Fiend of the Stygian night,
Was in an instant on the wing.

Pale Loyalty, his guilt-steeled brow,
With wreaths of gory laurel crowned:
The hell-hounds, Murder, Want and Woe,
Forever hungering, flocked around;
From Spain had Satan sought their food,
'Twas human woe and human blood!

Hark! the earthquake's crash I hear,--
Kings turn pale, and Conquerors start,
Ruffians tremble in their fear,
For their Satan doth depart.

This day Fiends give to revelry
To celebrate their King's return,
And with delight its Sire to see
Hell's adamantine limits burn.

But were the Devil's sight as keen
As Reason's penetrating eye,
His sulphurous Majesty I ween,
Would find but little cause for joy.

For the sons of Reason see
That, ere fate consume the Pole,
The false Tyrant's cheek shall be
Bloodless as his coward soul.
```

### Word Suggestions

Consider these word pairs that complement your poem's tone:

- **house** (Germanic) / **domicile** (Latinate)
  - *The word 'house' has a more familiar and everyday connotation, evoking warmth and a sense of belonging. On the other hand, 'domicile' carries a more formal and detached tone, emphasizing the physical structure over the emotional connection. For a poem that aims to evoke nostalgia and longing, 'house' would work better to convey a sense of personal history and emotional attachment.*
  - **Recommended:** Use the germanic version to enhance your poem's tone

- **wind** (Germanic) / **ventilation** (Latinate)
  - *'Wind' is a simple and direct word that conveys movement and natural elements, often associated with memories and change. 'Ventilation,' on the other hand, is more technical and specific, focusing on air circulation. In the context of a poem about revisiting a childhood home and evoking sensory details, 'wind' would be more evocative and fitting for creating a vivid atmosphere.*
  - **Recommended:** Use the germanic version to enhance your poem's tone

- **come** (Germanic) / **arrive** (Latinate)
  - *The word 'come' is more casual and colloquial, suggesting a sense of familiarity and personal connection. 'Arrive' has a more formal and distant tone, emphasizing the act of reaching a destination. In a poem exploring the bittersweet nostalgia of revisiting a childhood home, 'come' would better capture the emotional intimacy and personal experience of returning to a familiar place.*
