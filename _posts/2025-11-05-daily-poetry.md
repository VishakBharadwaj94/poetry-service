## Encouraged by Paul Laurence Dunbar

```
Because you love me I have much achieved,
Had you despised me then I must have failed,
But since I knew you trusted and believed,
I could not disappoint you and so prevailed.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

In this poem, "Encouraged" by Paul Laurence Dunbar, the form is a quatrain with a rhyme scheme of ABAB. Each stanza consists of four lines, which creates a sense of cohesion and symmetry within the poem. The structure is straightforward, allowing the reader to focus on the message being conveyed without distraction. 

In terms of meter, the poem follows a consistent pattern of iambic tetrameter. This means that each line contains four metrical feet, with each foot consisting of an unstressed syllable followed by a stressed syllable. This rhythmic pattern gives the poem a steady and flowing quality, enhancing the overall readability and impact of the verses.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem revolves around the power of love and encouragement in helping individuals achieve their goals. The speaker acknowledges that their success is directly linked to the support and belief shown by someone they love. This theme is reinforced through imagery that conveys a sense of trust, belief, and determination. The use of words like "love," "trusted," "believed," "disappoint," and "prevailed" evokes a strong emotional response and highlights the importance of positive reinforcement in overcoming obstacles.

### Literary Devices

Dunbar employs several literary devices to enhance the poem's meaning and impact. One notable device is personification, as the speaker attributes human qualities to the abstract concepts of love and encouragement. This personification serves to emphasize the nurturing and motivating aspects of these emotions.

Additionally, the use of contrast between love and despise, trust and disbelief, and success and failure creates a sense of tension and resolution within the poem. This contrast serves to underscore the speaker's gratitude and determination to live up to the expectations set by their loved one.

### Historical and Personal Context

Paul Laurence Dunbar, an African American poet writing in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, often explored themes of love, race, and identity in his work. As a prominent figure in the literary movement known as the Harlem Renaissance, Dunbar's poetry reflected the social and cultural challenges faced by African Americans during this time period.

In the context of "Encouraged," Dunbar's personal experiences as a black poet striving for recognition and success likely influenced the themes of perseverance and validation through support and encouragement. The poem can be seen as a reflection of Dunbar's own struggles and triumphs in the face of adversity.

### Deep Reading

A deeper analysis of "Encouraged" reveals a profound meditation on the interplay between external validation and internal motivation. The speaker's acknowledgment of the impact of love and belief in their achievements highlights the complex relationship between self-worth and external affirmation. By recognizing the role of encouragement in their success, the speaker also underscores the importance of reciprocity in relationships and the power of positive reinforcement.

Furthermore, the poem invites readers to reflect on the ways in which our beliefs about ourselves are shaped by the beliefs of those who love and support us. Through its evocative language and poignant imagery, "Encouraged" serves as a poignant reminder of the transformative power of love and encouragement in shaping our paths to success and fulfillment.

## Disabled by Wilfred Owen

```
He sat in a wheeled chair, waiting for dark,
And shivered in his ghastly suit of grey,
Legless, sewn short at elbow.  Through the park
Voices of boys rang saddening like a hymn,
Voices of play and pleasure after day,
Till gathering sleep had mothered them from him.

About this time Town used to swing so gay
When glow-lamps budded in the light-blue trees
And girls glanced lovelier as the air grew dim,
-- In the old times, before he threw away his knees.
Now he will never feel again how slim
Girls' waists are, or how warm their subtle hands,
All of them touch him like some queer disease.

There was an artist silly for his face,
For it was younger than his youth, last year.
Now he is old; his back will never brace;
He's lost his colour very far from here,
Poured it down shell-holes till the veins ran dry,
And half his lifetime lapsed in the hot race,
And leap of purple spurted from his thigh.
One time he liked a bloodsmear down his leg,
After the matches carried shoulder-high.
It was after football, when he'd drunk a peg,
He thought he'd better join.  He wonders why . . .
Someone had said he'd look a god in kilts.

That's why; and maybe, too, to please his Meg,
Aye, that was it, to please the giddy jilts,
He asked to join.  He didn't have to beg;
Smiling they wrote his lie; aged nineteen years.
Germans he scarcely thought of; and no fears
Of Fear came yet.  He thought of jewelled hilts
For daggers in plaid socks; of smart salutes;
And care of arms; and leave; and pay arrears;
Esprit de corps; and hints for young recruits.
And soon, he was drafted out with drums and cheers.

Some cheered him home, but not as crowds cheer Goal.
Only a solemn man who brought him fruits
Thanked him; and then inquired about his soul.
Now, he will spend a few sick years in Institutes,
And do what things the rules consider wise,
And take whatever pity they may dole.
To-night he noticed how the women's eyes
Passed from him to the strong men that were whole.
How cold and late it is!  Why don't they come
And put him into bed?  Why don't they come?
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "Disabled" by Wilfred Owen is written in free verse, meaning it does not follow a specific rhyme scheme or meter. This lack of formal structure mirrors the chaotic and disjointed nature of the soldier's thoughts and experiences. The poem consists of seven stanzas, each varying in length, which adds to the sense of fragmentation and disorientation. The absence of a consistent structure reflects the soldier's shattered life and disconnected memories.

### Themes and Imagery

One of the central themes of the poem is the devastating impact of war on an individual. The soldier is depicted as physically and emotionally broken, robbed of his youth, vitality, and sense of self. The imagery in the poem is vivid and poignant, evoking a sense of loss and despair. Lines such as "He sat in a wheeled chair, waiting for dark" and "Poured it down shell-holes till the veins ran dry" paint a stark picture of the soldier's suffering and alienation.

The poem also explores themes of isolation, regret, and the disillusionment of war. The soldier is portrayed as a tragic figure, abandoned by society and left to grapple with the harsh realities of his condition. The contrast between his memories of youth and the stark present serves to highlight the profound sense of loss and longing that pervades the poem.

### Literary Devices

Owen employs a variety of literary devices to convey the emotional weight of the soldier's experience. Imagery is used extensively throughout the poem to create vivid and evocative descriptions. For example, the image of "glow-lamps budded in the light-blue trees" juxtaposed with the soldier's current state of despair underscores the stark contrast between past and present.

The use of irony is also prevalent in the poem, particularly in lines such as "Someone had said he'd look a god in kilts" and "He thought of jewelled hilts for daggers in plaid socks." These ironic statements serve to highlight the absurdity and futility of war, as well as the false promises and illusions that lured the soldier into battle.

### Historical and Personal Context

Wilfred Owen was a British poet who served as a soldier in World War I, and his poetry often reflects his firsthand experiences of the horrors of war. "Disabled" was written during Owen's time in the war and draws on his observations of the physical and psychological toll that combat took on soldiers. The poem offers a poignant reflection on the devastating consequences of war and the lasting impact it has on individuals.

The historical context of World War I, known for its unprecedented brutality and senseless violence, provides a backdrop for the poem's themes of suffering, loss, and disillusionment. Owen's personal experiences as a soldier inform the raw and unflinching portrayal of the soldier in the poem, adding depth and authenticity to the narrative.

### Deep Reading

"Disabled" offers a searing indictment of the glorification of war and the dehumanizing effects it has on those who are caught in its grip. The soldier in the poem is stripped of his agency, identity, and humanity, reduced to a mere shell of his former self. The poem serves as a powerful critique of the way society neglects and marginalizes those who have sacrificed their well-being for the sake of war.

The final lines of the poem, "How cold and late it is! Why don't they come / And put him into bed? Why don't they come?" reveal the soldier's profound sense of abandonment and desperation. The lack of compassion and support he receives underscores the callous indifference of society towards those who have been broken by war. "Disabled" serves as a haunting reminder of the human cost of conflict and the lasting scars it leaves on individuals long after the guns have fallen silent.

## The Cry Of The Children by Elizabeth Barrett Browning

```
Do ye hear the children weeping, O my brothers,
Ere the sorrow comes with years?
They are leaning their young heads against their mothers,
And that cannot stop their tears.
The young lambs are bleating in the meadows,
The young birds are chirping in the nest,
The young fawns are playing with the shadows,
The young flowers are blowing toward the west—
But the young, young children, O my brothers,
They are weeping bitterly!
They are weeping in the playtime of the others,
In the country of the free.

Do you question the young children in their sorrow,
Why their tears are falling so?
The old man may weep for his tomorrow,
Which is lost in Long Ago;
The old tree is leafless in the forest,
The old year is ending in the frost,
The old wound, if stricken, is the sorest,
The old hope is hardest to be lost:
But the young, young children, O my brothers,
Do you ask them why they stand
Weeping sore before the bosoms of their mothers,
In our happy Fatherland?

They look up with their pale and sunken faces,
And their looks are sad to see,
For the man's hoary anguish draws and presses
Down the cheeks of infancy;
"Your old earth," they say, "is very dreary;
Our young feet," they say, "are very weak!
Few paces have we taken, yet are weary—
Our grave-rest is very far to seek.
Ask the aged why they weep, and not the children,
For the outside earth is cold,
And we young ones stand without, in our bewildering,
And the graves are for the old."

"True," say the children, "it may happen
That we die before our time.
Little Alice died last year—her grave is shapen
Like a snowball, in the rime.
We looked into the pit prepared to take her:
Was no room for any work in the close clay!
From the sleep wherein she lieth none will wake her,
Crying 'Get up, little Alice! it is day.'
If you listen by that grave, in sun and shower,
With your ear down, little Alice never cries;
Could we see her face, be sure we should not know her,
For the smile has time for growing in her eyes:
And merry go her moments, lulled and stilled in
The shroud by the kirk-chime.
It is good when it happens," say the children,
"That we die before our time."

Alas, alas, the children! They are seeking
Death in life, as best to have;
They are binding up their hearts away from breaking,
With a cerement from the grave.
Go out, children, from the mine and from the city,
Sing out, children, as the little thrushes do;
Pluck your handfuls of the meadow-cowslips pretty,
Laugh aloud, to feel your fingers let them through!
But they answer, "Are your cowslips of the meadows
Like our weeds anear the mine?
Leave us quiet in the dark of the coal-shadows,
From your pleasures fair and fine!

"For oh," say the children, "we are weary,
And we cannot run or leap;
If we cared for any meadows, it were merely
To drop down in them and sleep.
Our knees tremble sorely in the stooping,
We fall upon our faces, trying to go;
And, underneath our heavy eyelids drooping,
The reddest flower would look as pale as snow.
For, all day, we drag our burden tiring
Through the coal-dark, underground;
Or, all day, we drive the wheels of iron
In the factories, round and round.

"For all day the wheels are droning, turning;
Their wind comes in our faces,—
Till our hearts turn, our heads with pulses burning,
And the walls turn in their places:
Turns the sky in the high window blank and reeling,
Turns the long light that drops adown the wall,
Turn the black flies that crawl along the ceiling,—
All are turning, all the day, and we with all.
And all day, the iron wheels are droning,
And sometimes we could pray,
'O ye wheels,' (breaking out in a mad moaning)
'Stop! be silent for today!' "

Ay, be silent! Let them hear each other breathing
For a moment, mouth to mouth!
Let them touch each other's hands, in a fresh wreathing
Of their tender human youth!
Let them feel that this cold metallic motion
Is not all the life God fashions or reveals:
Let them prove their living souls against the notion
That they live in you, or under you, O wheels!
Still, all day, the iron wheels go onward,
Grinding life down from its mark;
And the children's souls, which God is calling sunward,
Spin on blindly in the dark.

Now tell the poor young children, O my brothers,
To look up to Him and pray;
So the blessed One, who blesseth all the others,
Will bless them another day.
They answer, "Who is God that He should hear us,
While the rushing of the iron wheels is stirred?
When we sob aloud, the human creatures near us
Pass by, hearing not, or answer not a word.
And we hear not (for the wheels in their resounding)
Strangers speaking at the door:
Is it likely God, with angels singing round Him,
Hears our weeping any more?

"Two words, indeed, of praying we remember,
And at midnight's hour of harm,
'Our Father,' looking upward in the chamber,
We say softly for a charm.
We know no other words except 'Our Father,'
And we think that, in some pause of angels' song,
God may pluck them with the silence sweet to gather,
And hold both within His right hand which is strong.
'Our Father!' If He heard us, He would surely
(For they call Him good and mild)
Answer, smiling down the steep world very purely,
'Come and rest with me, my child.'

"But, no!" say the children, weeping faster,
"He is speechless as a stone:
And they tell us, of His image is the master
Who commands us to work on.
Go to!" say the children,—"up in heaven,
Dark, wheel-like, turning clouds are all we find.
Do not mock us; grief has made us unbelieving—
We look up for God, but tears have made us blind."
Do you hear the children weeping and disproving,
O my brothers, what ye preach?
For God's possible is taught by His world's loving,
And the children doubt of each.

And well may the children weep before you!
They are weary ere they run;
They have never seen the sunshine, nor the glory
Which is brighter than the sun.
They know the grief of man, without its wisdom;
They sink in man's despair, without its calm,—
Are slaves, without the liberty in Christdom,—
Are martyrs, by the pang without the palm,—
Are worn as if with age, yet unretrievingly
The harvest of its memories cannot reap,—
Are orphans of the earthly love and heavenly.
Let them weep! let them weep!

They look up with their pale and sunken faces,
And their look is dread to see,
For they mind you of their angels in high places,
With eyes turned on Deity;—
"How long," they say, "how long, O cruel nation,
Will you stand, to move the world, on a child's heart,—
Stifle down with a mailed heel its palpitation,
And tread onward to your throne amid the mart?
Our blood splashes upward, O gold-heaper,
And its purple shows your path!
But the child's sob in the silence curses deeper
Than the strong man in his wrath."
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

Elizabeth Barrett Browning's poem "The Cry Of The Children" is written in a dramatic monologue form, where the speaker directly addresses the audience, urging them to consider the plight of children in harsh working conditions during the Industrial Revolution. The poem consists of 13 stanzas, each with varying lengths, creating a sense of urgency and fragmented narrative. The irregular structure mirrors the chaotic and unsettling reality faced by the children in the poem.

The meter of the poem is predominantly iambic pentameter, with five stressed and unstressed syllables in each line. However, Browning skillfully varies the meter to convey different emotions and intensify the themes of suffering and despair. The rhyme scheme is irregular but often follows an ABAB or AABB pattern, contributing to the disjointed and unsettling tone of the poem.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem is the exploitation and suffering of children in the industrialized world. Browning vividly portrays the physical and emotional toll that child labor takes on young individuals, contrasting their innocence and vulnerability with the harsh realities of their existence. The imagery of young children weeping, working in dark mines, and yearning for rest and freedom evokes a sense of profound sadness and injustice.

The poem also explores themes of faith, power dynamics, and the dehumanizing effects of industrialization. Browning critiques the societal indifference towards the suffering of the most vulnerable members of society and questions the role of religion and authority in perpetuating such injustices. The juxtaposition of natural imagery with scenes of industrial labor highlights the stark contrast between the beauty of the natural world and the brutality of human exploitation.

### Literary Devices

Browning employs various literary devices to enhance the emotional impact of the poem. Throughout the poem, there is a use of parallelism, repetition, and rhetorical questions to emphasize the children's suffering and to challenge the audience's perceptions. The recurring motif of weeping children and the contrast between natural and industrial imagery serve as powerful symbols of innocence lost and the destructive consequences of unchecked capitalism.

Additionally, Browning utilizes imagery, such as the "iron wheels" and the "dark, wheel-like, turning clouds," to symbolize the relentless and dehumanizing nature of industrial machinery. The use of personification, as seen in the children's dialogue with the natural world and with God, adds depth to their voices and emphasizes their profound sense of abandonment and despair.

### Historical and Personal Context

"The Cry Of The Children" was written by Elizabeth Barrett Browning in response to the harsh conditions faced by child laborers in 19th-century England. Browning was a social activist and advocate for social reform, and this poem reflects her deep concern for the welfare of marginalized members of society. The Industrial Revolution brought about significant changes in labor practices, leading to the exploitation of children in factories, mines, and workshops.

Browning's personal experiences and observations of social injustices influenced her writing, and "The Cry Of The Children" stands as a powerful indictment of the inhumane treatment of young workers during this period. The poem sheds light on the human cost of industrialization and calls attention to the urgent need for social and political reform to protect the most vulnerable members of society.

### Deep Reading

At its core, "The Cry Of The Children" is a poignant plea for empathy and action in the face of widespread suffering and injustice. Through the voices of the children, Browning challenges the audience to confront their complicity in perpetuating systems of oppression and exploitation. The repeated cries of the children for rest, freedom, and compassion serve as a haunting reminder of the consequences of societal indifference and neglect.

By giving voice to the voiceless and shedding light on the hidden realities of child labor, Browning's poem remains a powerful call to conscience and a testament to the enduring power of literature to provoke social change. "The Cry Of The Children" stands as a timeless reminder of the importance of compassion, justice, and solidarity in the face of adversity, urging us to listen to the cries of the most vulnerable among us and to take meaningful action to create a more just and humane world.
