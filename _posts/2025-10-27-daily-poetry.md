## From Sunset to Star Rise by Christina Rossetti

```
Go from me, summer friends, and tarry not:
I am no summer friend, but wintry cold,
A silly sheep benighted from the fold,
A sluggard with a thorn-choked garden plot.
Take counsel, sever from my lot your lot,
Dwell in your pleasant places, hoard your gold;
Lest you with me should shiver on the wold,
Athirst and hungering on a barren spot.
For I have hedged me with a thorny hedge,
I live alone, I look to die alone:
Yet sometimes, when a wind sighs through the sedge,
Ghosts of my buried years, and friends come back,
My heart goes sighing after swallows flown
On sometime summer's unreturning track.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "From Sunset to Star Rise" by Christina Rossetti is structured as a Petrarchan sonnet, consisting of an octave (eight lines) followed by a sestet (six lines). The rhyme scheme of the octave is ABBAABBA, while the sestet follows a CDECDE pattern. This traditional form allows Rossetti to explore the themes of isolation and longing within a structured framework.

The meter of the poem is primarily iambic pentameter, with five feet per line. This regular meter contributes to the overall flow and rhythm of the poem, enhancing the reader's experience of the speaker's emotions. The use of enjambment in certain lines also adds a sense of urgency and emotional depth to the poem.

### Themes and Imagery

The central themes of the poem revolve around loneliness, isolation, and nostalgia. The speaker expresses a sense of alienation from others, referring to themselves as "wintry cold" and a "silly sheep benighted from the fold." This imagery conveys a feeling of being out of place and disconnected from the warmth and companionship of others.

The speaker's thorny hedge symbolizes their emotional barriers and reluctance to form meaningful connections with others. Despite their isolation, the speaker experiences moments of longing and reminiscence, as seen in the imagery of "Ghosts of my buried years" and "My heart goes sighing after swallows flown." These images evoke a sense of nostalgia for past friendships and moments of warmth that are now lost.

### Literary Devices

Rossetti employs several literary devices throughout the poem to enhance its themes and imagery. The use of metaphor is prominent, with the speaker comparing themselves to a "silly sheep" and a "sluggard with a thorn-choked garden plot." These metaphors convey the speaker's feelings of inadequacy and emotional barriers.

The repeated use of alliteration, such as in "shiver on the wold" and "sighs through the sedge," creates a sense of rhythm and musicality in the poem. This technique enhances the emotional impact of the speaker's words and draws the reader further into their inner world.

### Historical and Personal Context

Christina Rossetti was a prominent Victorian poet known for her introspective and melancholic verse. As a devout Christian, her poetry often explores themes of death, love, and spirituality. In the context of this poem, Rossetti's personal struggles with illness and isolation likely influenced her portrayal of loneliness and longing for connection.

The Victorian era was characterized by rapid industrialization and social change, leading to a sense of alienation and disillusionment among many individuals. Rossetti's depiction of the speaker's isolation and emotional barriers reflects the broader societal concerns of the time, as people grappled with the impact of modernity on their sense of identity and community.

### Deep Reading

Through the juxtaposition of summer and winter imagery, Rossetti explores the contrast between warmth and coldness, companionship and loneliness. The speaker's reluctance to form connections with others stems from a fear of rejection and a sense of unworthiness, as seen in the metaphor of the thorny hedge. Despite their isolation, the speaker's heart still yearns for the warmth and joy of past friendships, symbolized by the swallows and ghosts of buried years.

Ultimately, "From Sunset to Star Rise" captures the complexities of human relationships and the enduring nature of longing and nostalgia. Rossetti's skillful use of form, imagery, and literary devices creates a poignant and evocative portrayal of loneliness and the bittersweet memories that linger in the heart.

## Mycerinus by Matthew Arnold

```
'Not by the justice that my father spurn'd,
Not for the thousands whom my father slew,
Altars unfed and temples overturn'd,
Cold hearts and thankless tongues, where thanks are due;
Fell this dread voice from lips that cannot lie,
Stern sentence of the Powers of Destiny.

'I will unfold my sentence and my crime.
My crime--that, rapt in reverential awe,
I sate obedient, in the fiery prime
Of youth, self-govern'd, at the feet of Law;
Ennobling this dull pomp, the life of kings,
By contemplation of diviner things.

'My father loved injustice, and lived long;
Crown'd with grey hairs he died, and full of sway.
I loved the good he scorn'd, and hated wrong--
The Gods declare my recompense to-day.
I look'd for life more lasting, rule more high;
And when six years are measured, lo, I die!

'Yet surely, O my people, did I deem
Man's justice from the all-just Gods was given;
A light that from some upper fount did beam,
Some better archetype, whose seat was heaven;
A light that, shining from the blest abodes,
Did shadow somewhat of the life of Gods.

'Mere phantoms of man's self-tormenting heart,
Which on the sweets that woo it dares not feed!
Vain dreams, which quench our pleasures, then depart
When the duped soul, self-master'd, claims its meed;
When, on the strenuous just man, Heaven bestows,
Crown of his struggling life, an unjust close!

'Seems it so light a thing, then, austere Powers,
To spurn man's common lure, life's pleasant things?
Seems there no joy in dances crown'd with flowers,
Love, free to range, and regal banquetings?
Bend ye on these, indeed, an unmoved eye,
Not Gods but ghosts, in frozen apathy?

'Or is it that some Force, too wise, too strong,
Even for yourselves to conquer or beguile,
Sweeps earth, and heaven, and men, and Gods along,
Like the broad volume of the insurgent Nile?
And the great powers we serve, themselves may be
Slaves of a tyrannous necessity?

'Or in mid-heaven, perhaps, your golden cars,
Where earthly voice climbs never, wing their flight,
And in wild hunt, through mazy tracts of stars,
Sweep in the sounding stillness of the night?
Or in deaf ease, on thrones of dazzling sheen,
Drinking deep draughts of joy, ye dwell serene?

'Oh, wherefore cheat our youth, if thus it be,
Of one short joy, one lust, one pleasant dream?
Stringing vain words of powers we cannot see,
Blind divinations of a will supreme;
Lost labour! when the circumambient gloom
But hides, if Gods, Gods careless of our doom?

'The rest I give to joy. Even while I speak,
My sand runs short; and--as yon star-shot ray,
Hemm'd by two banks of cloud, peers pale and weak,
Now, as the barrier closes, dies away--
Even so do past and future intertwine,
Blotting this six years' space, which yet is mine.

'Six years--six little years--six drops of time!
Yet suns shall rise, and many moons shall wane,
And old men die, and young men pass their prime,
And languid pleasure fade and flower again,
And the dull Gods behold, ere these are flown,
Revels more deep, joy keener than their own.

'Into the silence of the groves and woods
I will go forth; though something would I say--
Something--yet what, I know not; for the Gods
The doom they pass revoke not, nor delay;
And prayers, and gifts, and tears, are fruitless all,
And the night waxes, and the shadows fall.

'Ye men of Egypt, ye have heard your king!
I go, and I return not. But the will
Of the great Gods is plain; and ye must bring
Ill deeds, ill passions, zealous to fulfil
Their pleasure, to their feet; and reap their praise,
The praise of Gods, rich boon! and length of days.'

--So spake he, half in anger, half in scorn;
And one loud cry of grief and of amaze
Broke from his sorrowing people; so he spake,
And turning, left them there; and with brief pause,
Girt with a throng of revellers, bent his way
To the cool region of the groves he loved.
There by the river-banks he wander'd on,
From palm-grove on to palm-grove, happy trees,
Their smooth tops shining sunward, and beneath
Burying their unsunn'd stems in grass and flowers;
Where in one dream the feverish time of youth
Might fade in slumber, and the feet of joy
Might wander all day long and never tire.
Here came the king, holding high feast, at morn,
Rose-crown'd; and ever, when the sun went down,
A hundred lamps beam'd in the tranquil gloom,
From tree to tree all through the twinkling grove,
Revealing all the tumult of the feast--
Flush'd guests, and golden goblets foam'd with wine;
While the deep-burnish'd foliage overhead
Splinter'd the silver arrows of the moon.

It may be that sometimes his wondering soul
From the loud joyful laughter of his lips
Might shrink half startled, like a guilty man
Who wrestles with his dream; as some pale shape
Gliding half hidden through the dusky stems,
Would thrust a hand before the lifted bowl,
Whispering: A little space, and thou art mine!
It may be on that joyless feast his eye
Dwelt with mere outward seeming; he, within,
Took measure of his soul, and knew its strength,
And by that silent knowledge, day by day,
Was calm'd, ennobled, comforted, sustain'd.
It may be; but not less his brow was smooth,
And his clear laugh fled ringing through the gloom,
And his mirth quail'd not at the mild reproof
Sigh'd out by winter's sad tranquillity;
Nor, pall'd with its own fulness, ebb'd and died
In the rich languor of long summer-days;
Nor wither'd when the palm-tree plumes, that roof'd
With their mild dark his grassy banquet-hall,
Bent to the cold winds of the showerless spring;
No, nor grew dark when autumn brought the clouds.

So six long years he revell'd, night and day.
And when the mirth wax'd loudest, with dull sound
Sometimes from the grove's centre echoes came,
To tell his wondering people of their king;
In the still night, across the steaming flats,
Mix'd with the murmur of the moving Nile.
```

## Trees by Joyce Kilmer

```
(For Mrs. Henry Mills Alden)

I think that I shall never see
A poem lovely as a tree.
A tree whose hungry mouth is prest
Against the earth's sweet flowing breast;
A tree that looks at God all day,
And lifts her leafy arms to pray;
A tree that may in Summer wear
A nest of robins in her hair;
Upon whose bosom snow has lain;
Who intimately lives with rain.
Poems are made by fools like me,
But only God can make a tree.
```
