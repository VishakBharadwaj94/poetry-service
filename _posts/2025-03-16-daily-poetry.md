## A Fragment: To Music by Percy Bysshe Shelley

```
Silver key of the fountain of tears,
Where the spirit drinks till the brain is wild;
Softest grave of a thousand fears,
Where their mother, Care, like a drowsy child,
Is laid asleep in flowers.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme
In "A Fragment: To Music," Percy Bysshe Shelley employs a free verse form, deviating from traditional rhyme schemes and meters. The lack of a consistent rhyme scheme allows for a more natural flow of the poem, mirroring the fluidity and emotive power of music itself. The poem consists of four lines, each with varying lengths, contributing to its fragmented and dream-like quality. This structure reflects the fleeting nature of music and the ephemeral emotions it evokes.

### Themes and Imagery
The central themes of the poem revolve around the transformative power of music and its ability to soothe the soul. The imagery used by Shelley is rich and evocative, painting a vivid picture of music as a "Silver key of the fountain of tears" and "Softest grave of a thousand fears." These metaphors suggest that music has the ability to unlock deep emotions and provide solace in times of distress. The image of Care, personified as a "drowsy child" laid asleep in flowers, conveys a sense of peace and tranquility brought about by music.

### Literary Devices
Shelley employs various literary devices to enhance the poem's impact. The use of personification is evident in phrases like "where their mother, Care, like a drowsy child," giving human-like qualities to abstract concepts. Additionally, the metaphor of music as a "Silver key of the fountain of tears" adds depth to the poem, suggesting that music has the power to unlock and release pent-up emotions. The repetition of soft consonant sounds in "Softest grave of a thousand fears" creates a soothing and melodic effect, echoing the calming influence of music.

### Historical and Personal Context
Written during the Romantic era, Shelley's poem reflects the period's celebration of nature, emotion, and individualism. The emphasis on music as a source of comfort and inspiration aligns with the Romantic belief in the power of art to elevate the soul. Shelley's personal experiences, including his own struggles with melancholy and creativity, likely influenced the poem's themes of solace and emotional release through music.

### Deep Reading
On a deeper level, "A Fragment: To Music" can be interpreted as a meditation on the transcendent nature of art and its ability to transcend worldly cares. The image of Care being laid asleep in flowers suggests a temporary reprieve from anxiety and sorrow, achieved through the transformative power of music. By likening music to a key that unlocks the fountain of tears, Shelley implies that music has the capacity to tap into deep-seated emotions and provide catharsis. Ultimately, the poem speaks to the universal human experience of finding solace and healing in the beauty of art.

## In Memory of Rupert Brooke by Joyce Kilmer

```
In alien earth, across a troubled sea,
His body lies that was so fair and young.
His mouth is stopped, with half his songs unsung;
His arm is still, that struck to make men free.
But let no cloud of lamentation be
Where, on a warrior's grave, a lyre is hung.
We keep the echoes of his golden tongue,
We keep the vision of his chivalry.
So Israel's joy, the loveliest of kings,
Smote now his harp, and now the hostile horde.
To-day the starry roof of Heaven rings
With psalms a soldier made to praise his Lord;
And David rests beneath Eternal wings,
Song on his lips, and in his hand a sword.
```

Ultimately, the poem serves as a reminder of the power of art and heroism to transcend time and inspire future generations.

## To Flush, My Dog by Elizabeth Barrett Browning

```
Yet, my pretty sportive friend,
Little is't to such an end
That I praise thy rareness!
Other dogs may be thy peers
Haply in these drooping ears,
And this glossy fairness.

But of thee it shall be said,
This dog watched beside a bed
Day and night unweary—
Watched within a curtained room,
Where no sunbeam brake the gloom
Round the sick and dreary.

Roses, gathered for a vase,
In that chamber died apace,
Beam and breeze resigning.
This dog only, waited on,
Knowing that when light is gone
Love remains for shining.

Other dogs in thymy dew
Tracked the hares, and followed through
Sunny moor or meadow.
This dog only, crept and crept
Next a languid cheek that slept,
Sharing in the shadow.

Other dogs of loyal cheer
Bounded at the whistle clear,
Up the woodside hieing.
This dog only, watched in reach
Of a faintly uttered speech,
Or a louder sighing.

And if one or two quick tears
Dropped upon his glossy ears,
Or a sigh came double—
Up he sprang in eager haste,
Fawning, fondling, breathing fast,
In a tender trouble.

And this dog was satisfied
If a pale thin hand would glide
Down his dewlaps sloping—
Which he pushed his nose within,
After—platforming his chin
On the palm left open.
```
