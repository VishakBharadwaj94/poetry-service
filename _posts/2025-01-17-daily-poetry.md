## At Home by Christina Rossetti

```
When I was dead, my spirit turned
To seek the much-frequented house:
I passed the door, and saw my friends
Feasting beneath green orange boughs;
From hand to hand they pushed the wine,
They sucked the pulp of plum and peach;
They sang, they jested, and they laughed,
For each was loved of each.

I listened to thier honest chat:
Said one: "To-morrow we shall be
Plod plod along the featureless sands,
And coasting miles and miles of sea."
Said one: "Before the turn of tide
We will achieve the eyrie-seat."
Said one: "To-morrow shall be like
To-day, but much more sweet."

"To-morrow," said they, strong with hope,
And dwelt upon the pleasant way:
"To-morrow," cried they, one and all,
While no one spoke of yesterday.
Their life stood full at blessed noon;
I, only I, had passed away:
"To-morrow and to-day," they cried;
I was of yesterday.

I shivered comfortless, but cast
No chill across the table-cloth;
I, all-forgotten, shivered, sad
To stay, and yet to part how loth:
I passed from the familiar room,
I who from love had passed away,
Like the remembrance of a guest
That tarrieth but a day.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

In terms of form, "At Home" by Christina Rossetti is a narrative poem consisting of six stanzas of varying lengths. The poem does not adhere to a strict rhyme scheme or meter, giving it a more conversational and reflective tone. The lack of rhyme scheme allows the poet to focus on the narrative and the emotions of the speaker rather than being constrained by a specific structure. The irregular structure mirrors the disjointed thoughts and feelings of the speaker as they observe their friends carrying on with their lives after their passing.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem revolves around the idea of mortality, memory, and the passage of time. The speaker, who is dead, observes their friends enjoying life and looking forward to the future, while they are left behind in the past. This creates a sense of isolation and longing for the speaker. The imagery of the "feasting beneath green orange boughs" and the friends enjoying wine and fruits creates a vivid picture of life and vitality, contrasting with the speaker's cold and lonely existence as a forgotten memory.

### Literary Devices

Rossetti employs various literary devices in the poem to enhance its meaning and emotional impact. The repetition of the word "To-morrow" emphasizes the friends' optimism and hope for the future, highlighting their forward-looking perspective. The use of personification, such as "my spirit turned" and "I, all-forgotten, shivered," adds depth and emotion to the speaker's experience of being a ghostly observer of their former life. The metaphor of the speaker being "Like the remembrance of a guest/ That tarrieth but a day" conveys the fleeting nature of life and memory.

### Historical and Personal Context

Christina Rossetti was a Victorian poet known for her introspective and melancholic themes. "At Home" reflects Rossetti's preoccupation with themes of death, memory, and the passage of time, which were common in her poetry. As a devout Christian, Rossetti often explored themes of mortality and the afterlife, which are evident in this poem as the speaker grapples with their existence after death. The poem also reflects Rossetti's own experiences of loss and longing, as she frequently wrote about grief and remembrance.

### Deep Reading

Through the speaker's poignant observations of their friends' vibrant lives contrasted with their own lonely and forgotten existence, Rossetti delves into the universal human experience of mortality and the passage of time. The poem evokes a sense of nostalgia, regret, and longing for what was lost. The speaker's isolation and inability to connect with the living world highlight the transient nature of life and the inevitability of being forgotten. Overall, "At Home" invites readers to contemplate the fleeting nature of existence and the enduring power of memory.

## Home-Thoughts, From the Sea by Robert Browning

```
Nobly, nobly, Cape Saint Vincent to the Northwest died away;
Sunset ran, one glorious blood-red, reeking into Cadiz Bay;
Bluish 'mid the burning water, full in face Trafalgar lay;

In the dimmest Northeast distance dawned Gibraltar grand and gray;
"Here and here did England help me: how can I help England?"--say,
Whoso turns as I, this evening, turn to God and pray,
While Jove's planet rises yonder, silent over Africa.
```

### Literary Devices

Browning employs various literary devices to enhance the poem's impact. One such device is personification, as seen in the lines "Sunset ran, one glorious blood-red" and "Jove's planet rises yonder." These instances anthropomorphize natural elements, imbuing them with human qualities. The repetition of "nobly, nobly" at the beginning of the poem serves as a form of parallelism, emphasizing the grandeur of Cape Saint Vincent. Additionally, the rhetorical question "how can I help England?" adds a contemplative tone to the speaker's musings.

### Historical and Personal Context

The historical context of the poem is rooted in England's naval history, specifically referencing the Battle of Trafalgar and the significance of locations like Cape Saint Vincent and Gibraltar. Browning's personal connection to England is evident in the speaker's reflections on the country's assistance and the sense of duty towards it. The poem captures a moment of introspection and gratitude towards one's homeland, reflecting Browning's own feelings towards England.

### Deep Reading

At a deeper level, "Home-Thoughts, From the Sea" can be seen as a meditation on the complexities of national identity and loyalty. The speaker's contemplation of England's past actions and his own role in its future highlights the tension between individual agency and collective responsibility. The juxtaposition of natural beauty with questions of duty and allegiance underscores the interconnectedness of personal experiences and broader historical narratives. Ultimately, the poem invites readers to reflect on their own relationships with their homeland and the ways in which personal memories intersect with larger historical events.

## Little Brown Baby by Paul Laurence Dunbar

```
Little brown baby wif spa'klin' eyes,
Come to yo' pappy an' set on his knee.
What you been doin', suh -- makin' san' pies?
Look at dat bib -- you's es du'ty ez me.
Look at dat mouf -- dat's merlasses, I bet;
Come hyeah, Maria, an' wipe off his han's.
Bees gwine to ketch you an' eat you up yit,
Bein' so sticky an sweet -- goodness lan's!
Little brown baby wif spa'klin' eyes,
Who's pappy's darlin' an' who's pappy's chile?
Who is it all de day nevah once tries
Fu' to be cross, er once loses dat smile?
Whah did you git dem teef? My, you's a scamp!
Whah did dat dimple come f'om in yo' chin?
Pappy do' know you -- I b'lieves you's a tramp;
Mammy, dis hyeah's some ol' straggler got in!

Let's th'ow him outen de do' in de san',
We do' want stragglers a-layin' 'roun' hyeah;
Let's gin him 'way to de big buggah-man;
I know he's hidin' erroun' hyeah right neah.
Buggah-man, buggah-man, come in de do',
Hyeah's a bad boy you kin have fu' to eat.
Mammy an' pappy do' want him no mo',
Swaller him down f'om his haid to his feet!

Dah, now, I t'ought dat you'd hug me up close.
Go back, ol' buggah, you sha'n't have dis boy.
He ain't no tramp, ner no straggler, of co'se;
He's pappy's pa'dner an' play-mate an' joy.
Come to you' pallet now -- go to yo' res';
Wisht you could allus know ease an' cleah skies;
Wisht you could stay jes' a chile on my breas'--
Little brown baby wif spa'klin' eyes!
```

### Word Suggestions

Consider these word pairs that complement your poem's tone:

- **stair** (Germanic) / **grade** (Latinate)
  - *The word 'stair' carries a more everyday, tangible connotation, while 'grade' has a more abstract and academic feel.

- **earth** (Germanic) / **terrain** (Latinate)
  - *'Earth' is more grounded and familiar, often associated with home and roots, while 'terrain' has a broader and more distant implication. 'Earth' may evoke a sense of connection and belonging to the childhood home, while 'terrain' might distance the reader from the personal experience. To enhance the emotional resonance and nostalgia in the poem, 'earth' would be more effective.*

- **fatherly** (Germanic) / **paternal** (Latinate)
  - *'Fatherly' is warmer and more approachable, emphasizing the personal relationship, while 'paternal' is formal and distant, focusing on the role itself. 'Fatherly' could evoke memories of comfort and care in the childhood home, while 'paternal' might feel more detached.
