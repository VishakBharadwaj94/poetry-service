## Summer in the South by Paul Laurence Dunbar

```
The Oriole sings in the greening grove
As if he were half-way waiting,
The rosebuds peep from their hoods of green,
Timid, and hesitating.
The rain comes down in a torrent sweep
And the nights smell warm and pinety,
The garden thrives, but the tender shoots
Are yellow-green and tiny.
Then a flash of sun on a waiting hill,
Streams laugh that erst were quiet,
The sky smiles down with a dazzling blue
And the woods run mad with riot.
```

### Historical and Personal Context

Ultimately, "Summer in the South" serves as a poignant reminder of the cycles of nature and the eternal process of renewal that sustains us all.

## No, Thank You John by Christina Rossetti

```
I never said I loved you, John:
Why will you tease me day by day,
And wax a weariness to think upon
With always "do" and "pray"?

You Know I never loved you, John;
No fault of mine made me your toast:
Why will you haunt me with a face as wan
As shows an hour-old ghost?

I dare say Meg or Moll would take
Pity upon you, if you'd ask:
And pray don't remain single for my sake
Who can't perform the task.

I have no heart?-Perhaps I have not;
But then you're mad to take offence
That don't give you what I have not got:
Use your common sense.

Let bygones be bygones:
Don't call me false, who owed not to be true:
I'd rather answer "No" to fifty Johns
Than answer "Yes" to you.

Let's mar our plesant days no more,
Song-birds of passage, days of youth:
Catch at today, forget the days before:
I'll wink at your untruth.

Let us strike hands as hearty friends;
No more, no less; and friendship's good:
Only don't keep in veiw ulterior ends, And points not understood

In open treaty. Rise above
Quibbles and shuffling off and on:
Here's friendship for you if you like; but love,-
No, thank you, John.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme
The poem "No, Thank You John" by Christina Rossetti consists of 14 stanzas, each with four lines, following a consistent ABAB rhyme scheme. The regularity of the rhyme scheme adds a sense of control and order to the poem, reflecting the speaker's firm and unwavering stance towards John. The meter is primarily iambic tetrameter, with four metrical feet per line. This regular meter helps to create a sing-song quality in the poem, enhancing its lyrical nature.

### Themes and Imagery
The central theme of the poem is rejection and the firm assertion of personal boundaries. The speaker is resolute in her refusal to reciprocate John's affections, emphasizing her lack of love for him. Through vivid imagery, such as describing John as a "weariness to think upon" and a "face as wan as shows an hour-old ghost," Rossetti conveys the speaker's strong aversion towards John's persistent advances. The imagery of ghosts and haunting adds a haunting quality to the poem, underscoring the speaker's desire to be left alone.

### Literary Devices
Rossetti employs various literary devices to enhance the poem's meaning. One such device is irony, as the speaker repeatedly emphasizes her lack of love for John despite his persistent pursuit. The use of rhetorical questions, such as "I have no heart?-Perhaps I have not," adds a tone of defiance and independence to the speaker's rejection. Additionally, the repetition of the phrase "No, thank you, John" serves as a powerful refrain, emphasizing the speaker's firm stance and refusal.

### Historical and Personal Context
Christina Rossetti was writing during the Victorian era, a time when women's societal roles were often limited to domesticity and marriage. In this context, the speaker's rejection of John's advances can be seen as a subversion of traditional gender expectations. Rossetti herself never married and often explored themes of love, loss, and independence in her poetry. "No, Thank You John" reflects her own views on love and relationships, emphasizing the importance of personal agency and autonomy.

### Deep Reading
Through the speaker's repeated refusal and dismissal of John's advances, the poem can be seen as a commentary on the societal pressure placed on women to fulfill romantic expectations. The speaker's insistence on maintaining a platonic friendship with John, without succumbing to societal norms of romantic love, challenges traditional notions of relationships. By asserting her right to say "No" and setting boundaries, the speaker asserts her independence and autonomy. Ultimately, "No, Thank You John" can be read as a feminist statement on agency, self-determination, and the importance of respecting personal boundaries.

## For These by Edward Thomas

```
AN acre of land between the shore and the hills,
Upon a ledge that shows my kingdoms three,
The lovely visible earth and sky and sea,
Where what the curlew needs not, the farmer tills:

A house that shall love me as I love it,
Well-hedged, and honoured by a few ash-trees
That linnets, greenfinches, and goldfinches
Shall often visit and make love in and flit:

A garden I need never go beyond,
Broken but neat, whose sunflowers every one
Are fit to be the sign of the Rising Sun:
A spring, a brook's bend, or at least a pond:

For these I ask not, but, neither too late
Nor yet too early, for what men call content,
And also that something may be sent
To be contented with, I ask of fate.
```
