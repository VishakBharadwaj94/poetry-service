## Insensibility by Wilfred Owen

```
I

Happy are men who yet before they are killed
Can let their veins run cold.
Whom no compassion fleers
Or makes their feet
Sore on the alleys cobbled with their brothers.
The front line withers,
But they are troops who fade, not flowers
For poets' tearful fooling:
Men, gaps for filling
Losses who might have fought
Longer; but no one bothers.


    II

And some cease feeling
Even themselves or for themselves.
Dullness best solves
The tease and doubt of shelling,
And Chance's strange arithmetic
Comes simpler than the reckoning of their shilling.
They keep no check on Armies' decimation.


    III

Happy are these who lose imagination:
They have enough to carry with ammunition.
Their spirit drags no pack.
Their old wounds save with cold can not more ache.
Having seen all things red,
Their eyes are rid
Of the hurt of the colour of blood for ever.
And terror's first constriction over,
Their hearts remain small drawn.
Their senses in some scorching cautery of battle
Now long since ironed,
Can laugh among the dying, unconcerned.


    IV

Happy the soldier home, with not a notion
How somewhere, every dawn, some men attack,
And many sighs are drained.
Happy the lad whose mind was never trained:
His days are worth forgetting more than not.
He sings along the march
Which we march taciturn, because of dusk,
The long, forlorn, relentless trend
From larger day to huger night.


    V

We wise, who with a thought besmirch
Blood over all our soul,
How should we see our task
But through his blunt and lashless eyes?
Alive, he is not vital overmuch;
Dying, not mortal overmuch;
Nor sad, nor proud,
Nor curious at all.
He cannot tell
Old men's placidity from his.


    VI

But cursed are dullards whom no cannon stuns,
That they should be as stones.
Wretched are they, and mean
With paucity that never was simplicity.
By choice they made themselves immune
To pity and whatever mourns in man
Before the last sea and the hapless stars;
Whatever mourns when many leave these shores;
Whatever shares
The eternal reciprocity of tears.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

Wilfred Owen's poem "Insensibility" is structured into six stanzas with varying lengths. The poem does not adhere to a specific rhyme scheme, which adds to its conversational and raw tone. The lack of rhyme scheme mirrors the chaotic and disordered nature of war, emphasizing the harsh realities the soldiers face. The irregular line lengths also contribute to the sense of disorientation and fragmentation experienced by the soldiers in battle. 

In terms of meter, the poem does not strictly follow a metrical pattern. The irregular meter reflects the disjointed and unpredictable nature of war, highlighting the confusion and trauma experienced by the soldiers.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of "Insensibility" is the desensitization and emotional numbness that war inflicts on soldiers. Owen explores the idea that in order to survive the horrors of war, soldiers must become emotionally detached and insensible to the suffering around them. The poem vividly portrays the psychological toll of war, depicting soldiers who have lost their ability to feel compassion, fear, and sorrow.

The imagery in the poem is striking and evocative, with Owen using vivid descriptions to convey the dehumanizing effects of war. The image of soldiers whose "veins run cold" and who are "gaps for filling" highlights the loss of individuality and humanity experienced by those who have been hardened by battle. The contrast between the soldiers who have become emotionally numb and those who still feel deeply serves to emphasize the devastating impact of war on the human psyche.

### Literary Devices

Owen employs a variety of literary devices to convey the themes of desensitization and emotional numbness in war. One notable device is imagery, with Owen using vivid and powerful descriptions to evoke the harsh realities of battle. For example, the image of soldiers whose "eyes are rid / Of the hurt of the colour of blood for ever" conveys the emotional detachment and desensitization experienced by those who have witnessed the horrors of war.

Another literary device Owen utilizes is irony. The title "Insensibility" itself is ironic, as it suggests a lack of sensitivity or emotion, while the poem actually explores the profound emotional toll that war exacts on soldiers. This irony serves to underscore the disconnect between the outward appearance of indifference and the internal turmoil and suffering experienced by the soldiers.

### Historical and Personal Context

Wilfred Owen was a soldier in World War I, and his experiences on the front lines deeply influenced his poetry. "Insensibility" reflects Owen's firsthand knowledge of the psychological effects of war on soldiers. The poem was written during a time when the brutal realities of trench warfare were becoming increasingly apparent, and Owen sought to convey the harsh truths of war through his poetry.

The historical context of World War I, with its unprecedented scale of destruction and loss of life, provides a backdrop for Owen's exploration of the dehumanizing effects of war. The poem serves as a powerful indictment of the glorification of war and highlights the human cost of conflict.

### Deep Reading

"Insensibility" is a poignant and powerful exploration of the psychological toll of war, focusing on the emotional numbness and desensitization that soldiers experience in the face of unimaginable horror. Owen's use of vivid imagery, irony, and raw emotion creates a compelling portrait of the dehumanizing effects of war on the human psyche.

The poem forces readers to confront the harsh realities of conflict and challenges traditional notions of heroism and bravery in war. By depicting the soldiers as emotionally detached and insensible, Owen highlights the profound loss of humanity that occurs in the midst of battle. "Insensibility" serves as a stark reminder of the devastating impact of war on individuals and societies, urging us to reflect on the true cost of violence and conflict.

## There's Nothing Like the Sun by Edward Thomas

```
THERE'S nothing like the sun as the year dies,
Kind as it can be, this world being made so,
To stones and men and beasts and birds and flies,
To all things that it touches except snow,
Whether on mountain side or street of town.
The south wall warms me: November has begun,
Yet never shone the sun as fair as now
While the sweet last-left damsons from the bough
With spangles of the morning's storm drop down
Because the starling shakes it, whistling what
Once swallows sang. But I have not forgot
That there is nothing, too, like March's sun,
Like April's, or July's, or June's, or May's,
Or January's, or February's, great days:
And August, September, October, and December
Have equal days, all different from November.
No day of any month but I have said--
Or, if I could live long enough, should say--
"There's nothing like the sun that shines to-day"
There's nothing like the sun till we are dead.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

In terms of form, the poem "There's Nothing Like the Sun" by Edward Thomas consists of a single stanza with fourteen lines. This structure is characteristic of a sonnet, although it does not adhere to a specific rhyme scheme or meter typically associated with traditional sonnets. The lack of a consistent rhyme scheme or meter gives the poem a more free verse feel, allowing the content to take precedence over formal constraints.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem revolves around the beauty and significance of the sun as it interacts with the world throughout the changing seasons. The speaker marvels at the sun's ability to warm and illuminate everything it touches, from stones and men to beasts and birds. The imagery of the sun's warmth in various months, from November to January, is vividly depicted through descriptions of damsons falling from the bough and starlings whistling. This imagery evokes a sense of nostalgia and appreciation for the natural world.

### Literary Devices

One literary device employed in the poem is personification, where the sun is described as "Kind as it can be" and capable of shining "fair." This personification imbues the sun with human-like qualities, emphasizing its benevolent and beautiful nature. Additionally, the poem contains vivid imagery, such as "spangles of the morning's storm" and the sound of starlings whistling, which enhance the sensory experience for the reader.

### Historical and Personal Context

Edward Thomas was a British poet who wrote during the early 20th century, a time marked by significant social and political change. This poem reflects Thomas's deep connection to nature and his appreciation for the simple beauty of the natural world. It also captures a longing for the warmth and light of the sun amidst the changing seasons, which may resonate with readers experiencing their own personal or historical transitions.

### Deep Reading

On a deeper level, the poem can be seen as a meditation on the transient nature of life and the enduring power of the sun as a symbol of vitality and renewal. The speaker's repeated emphasis on the uniqueness and irreplaceability of each day's sunlight underscores the fleeting nature of existence and the preciousness of each moment. By celebrating the sun's warmth and light, the poem encourages readers to appreciate the beauty and life-giving energy present in the world around them. Ultimately, "There's Nothing Like the Sun" serves as a poignant reminder of the cyclical nature of time and the eternal significance of the sun in our lives.
