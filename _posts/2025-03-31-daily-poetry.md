## Lines Written In Early Spring by William Wordsworth

```
I heard a thousand blended notes,
While in a grove I sate reclined,
In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts
Bring sad thoughts to the mind.

To her fair works did Nature link
The human soul that through me ran;
And much it grieved my heart to think
What man has made of man.

Through primrose tufts, in that green bower,
The periwinkle trailed its wreaths;
And 'tis my faith that every flower
Enjoys the air it breathes.

The birds around me hopped and played,
Their thoughts I cannot measure:--
But the least motion which they made
It seemed a thrill of pleasure.

The budding twigs spread out their fan,
To catch the breezy air;
And I must think, do all I can,
That there was pleasure there.

If this belief from heaven be sent,
If such be Nature's holy plan,
Have I not reason to lament
What man has made of man?
```

## To a Blackbird and His Mate Who Died in the Spring by Joyce Kilmer

```
(For Kenton)

An iron hand has stilled the throats
That throbbed with loud and rhythmic glee
And dammed the flood of silver notes
That drenched the world in melody.
The blosmy apple boughs are yearning
For their wild choristers' returning,
But no swift wings flash through the tree.
Ye that were glad and fleet and strong,
Shall Silence take you in her net?
And shall Death quell that radiant song
Whose echo thrills the meadow yet?
Burst the frail web about you clinging
And charm Death's cruel heart with singing
Till with strange tears his eyes are wet.
The scented morning of the year
Is old and stale now ye are gone.
No friendly songs the children hear
Among the bushes on the lawn.
When babies wander out a-Maying
Will ye, their bards, afar be straying?
Unhymned by you, what is the dawn?
Nay, since ye loved ye cannot die.
Above the stars is set your nest.
Through Heaven's fields ye sing and fly
And in the trees of Heaven rest.
And little children in their dreaming
Shall see your soft black plumage gleaming
And smile, by your clear music blest.
```

## Hayeswater by Matthew Arnold

```
A region desolate and wild.
Black, chafing water: and afloat,
And lonely as a truant child
In a waste wood, a single boat:
No mast, no sails are set thereon;
It moves, but never moveth on:
And welters like a human thing
Amid the wild waves weltering.

Behind, a buried vale doth sleep,
Far down the torrent cleaves its way:
In front the dumb rock rises steep,
A fretted wall of blue and grey;
Of shooting cliff and crumbled stone
With many a wild weed overgrown:
All else, black water: and afloat,
One rood from shore, that single boat.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The use of enjambment, where lines run into each other without punctuation, adds to the fluidity of the poem and mirrors the movement of the water described in the imagery.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem revolves around the desolation and solitude of nature. The setting of a "region desolate and wild" conveys a sense of isolation and abandonment. The imagery of the "black, chafing water" and the "lonely" boat adrift in the vast expanse of the lake evokes a feeling of loneliness and melancholy. The contrast between the wild, untamed landscape and the solitary boat highlights the insignificance of human presence in the face of nature's power.

### Literary Devices

Arnold employs several literary devices to enhance the poem's meaning and evoke emotions in the reader. Personification is used in lines like "It moves, but never moveth on" and "And welters like a human thing," giving human qualities to the boat and the water, respectively.

Imagery is vividly portrayed through descriptions of the landscape, such as the "buried vale," the "fretted wall of blue and grey," and the "shooting cliff and crumbled stone," creating a vivid picture in the reader's mind.

### Historical and Personal Context

Matthew Arnold was a Victorian poet known for his introspective and reflective poetry. "Hayeswater" reflects Arnold's contemplation of nature and the human condition.

### Deep Reading

At a deeper level, "Hayeswater" can be seen as a meditation on the transience of human life and the eternal presence of nature. The stagnant boat symbolizes the stagnation and futility of human existence in the face of the relentless forces of nature.
