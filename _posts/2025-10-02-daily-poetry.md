## Like the Touch of Rain by Edward Thomas

```
LIKE the touch of rain she was
On a man's flesh and hair and eyes
When the joy of walking thus
Has taken him by surprise:

With the love of the storm he burns,
He sings, he laughs, well I know how,
But forgets when he returns
As I shall not forget her "Go now."

Those two words shut a door
Between me and the blessed rain
That was never shut before
And will not open again.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "Like the Touch of Rain" by Edward Thomas consists of four quatrains. Each quatrain follows an ABAB rhyme scheme, with the second and fourth lines of each stanza rhyming. This consistent rhyme scheme adds a sense of musicality to the poem. 

In terms of meter, the poem does not strictly adhere to a specific meter. However, there is a rhythmic quality to the lines, with a mix of iambs and trochees creating a flowing and natural cadence. The irregular meter contributes to the conversational and introspective tone of the poem.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem revolves around the transient nature of human emotions and relationships. The speaker compares the touch of rain to a fleeting moment of joy and connection with another person. The imagery of rain is used to evoke a sense of renewal and cleansing, as well as a symbol of unpredictability and impermanence.

The imagery of rain touching a man's flesh, hair, and eyes creates a sensory experience for the reader, emphasizing the intimacy and intensity of the moment. The storm is also described as a source of passion and vitality, contrasting with the finality of the closing door.

### Literary Devices

One prominent literary device in the poem is personification, as the rain is compared to a person ("LIKE the touch of rain she was"). This personification adds depth to the description of the rain, imbuing it with human-like qualities and emotions.

The use of repetition in the line "And will not open again" emphasizes the finality of the situation, highlighting the speaker's sense of loss and longing. The repetition also serves to reinforce the idea of closure and separation.

### Historical and Personal Context

Edward Thomas was a British poet who lived during the early 20th century. His poetry often explores themes of nature, loss, and the complexities of human emotions. Thomas's personal struggles with depression and his experiences during World War I influenced his poetic style and themes.

In this poem, the speaker's sense of longing and regret may reflect Thomas's own feelings of isolation and disillusionment. The closing door symbolizes a missed opportunity or a relationship that has come to an end, resonating with themes of loss and longing that are prevalent in Thomas's poetry.

### Deep Reading

The poem "Like the Touch of Rain" can be seen as a meditation on the fleeting nature of happiness and human connections. The speaker experiences a moment of joy and intimacy, likened to the touch of rain, only to have it abruptly end with the words "Go now."

The juxtaposition of the joy of the storm with the closing door creates a sense of contrast between passion and loss, highlighting the bittersweet nature of human emotions. The speaker's inability to forget the parting words underscores the lasting impact of fleeting moments of connection.

Overall, "Like the Touch of Rain" invites readers to reflect on the impermanence of life and the importance of cherishing moments of joy and connection, even when they are brief.

Had you despised me then I must have failed,
But since I knew you trusted and believed,
I could not disappoint you and so prevailed.

## Sonnet--To Science by Edgar Allan Poe

```
SCIENCE! true daughter of Old Time thou art!
  Who alterest all things with thy peering eyes.
Why preyest thou thus upon the poet's heart,
  Vulture, whose wings are dull realities
How should he love thee? or how deem thee wise,
  Who wouldst not leave him in his wandering
To seek for treasure in the jewelled skies,
  Albeit he soared with an undaunted wing!
Hast thou not dragged Diana from her car?
  And driven the Hamadryad from the wood
To seek a shelter in some happier star?
  Hast thou not torn the Naiad from her flood,
The Elfin from the green grass, and from me
The summer dream beneath the tamarind tree?
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

This poem is a sonnet, following the traditional 14-line structure with a rhyme scheme of ABABCDCDEFEFGG. It is divided into an octave (first eight lines) and a sestet (last six lines). The meter of the poem is primarily iambic pentameter, with five metrical feet per line following the pattern of unstressed syllable followed by a stressed syllable. However, Poe occasionally varies the meter for emphasis or to create a specific effect, such as in lines 4 and 6 where the meter is disrupted to highlight the harshness of the imagery.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem is the conflict between science and creativity, represented by the poet. Poe personifies science as a vulture preying on the poet's heart and stripping away the beauty and wonder of the natural world. The imagery used throughout the poem is vivid and evocative, with references to mythical beings like Diana, Hamadryads, Naiads, and Elves being displaced by the relentless advance of science. These images convey a sense of loss and nostalgia for a world that is being eroded by the progress of knowledge and technology.

### Literary Devices

Poe employs several literary devices in this poem to convey his message effectively. One prominent device is personification, where science is portrayed as a vulture and as a force that disrupts the harmony of the natural world. The use of rhetorical questions in lines 3 and 5 challenges the reader to consider the impact of science on the poet's imagination. Additionally, there is a strong use of imagery throughout the poem, with vivid descriptions of the poet's dreams being shattered by the encroachment of science.

### Historical and Personal Context

Written in the mid-19th century, during a time of rapid scientific advancement and industrialization, this poem reflects Poe's ambivalence towards the progress of science. As a Romantic poet, Poe valued imagination, creativity, and the beauty of nature, which he felt was being threatened by the relentless march of scientific discovery. The poem can also be seen as a reflection of Poe's personal struggles with loss and disillusionment, as he grappled with the death of loved ones and his own inner demons.

### Deep Reading

At its core, "Sonnet--To Science" can be seen as a lament for the loss of wonder and magic in the world, as science seeks to explain and demystify the mysteries of existence. The poet's frustration and sense of betrayal are palpable as he accuses science of robbing him of his dreams and fantasies. The poem serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of unchecked progress and the importance of preserving the beauty and enchantment of the natural world. Ultimately, Poe's message is a plea for balance and harmony between the rationality of science and the imagination of the poet.
