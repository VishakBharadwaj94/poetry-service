## Trees by Joyce Kilmer

```
(For Mrs. Henry Mills Alden)

I think that I shall never see
A poem lovely as a tree.
A tree whose hungry mouth is prest
Against the earth's sweet flowing breast;
A tree that looks at God all day,
And lifts her leafy arms to pray;
A tree that may in Summer wear
A nest of robins in her hair;
Upon whose bosom snow has lain;
Who intimately lives with rain.
Poems are made by fools like me,
But only God can make a tree.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "Trees" by Joyce Kilmer is written in a simple and traditional form with a rhyme scheme of AABBCCDD. It consists of one stanza with twelve lines in total. The meter is predominantly iambic tetrameter, with four beats per line. Kilmer's use of consistent rhyme and meter creates a harmonious and musical quality throughout the poem.

### Themes and Imagery

One of the central themes of the poem is the beauty and majesty of nature, specifically trees. Kilmer personifies the tree, presenting it as a living, breathing entity that is in constant communion with the earth and God. The imagery used in the poem is vivid and evocative, with descriptions of the tree's "hungry mouth" pressing against the earth, its "leafy arms" lifted in prayer, and its ability to host a "nest of robins" in its branches. Through these images, Kilmer celebrates the tree as a symbol of resilience, beauty, and divine creation.

### Literary Devices

Kilmer employs several literary devices throughout the poem to enhance its meaning and impact. One notable device is personification, where the tree is given human-like qualities such as a "hungry mouth" and the ability to "look at God all day." This personification serves to emphasize the tree's connection to the natural world and the divine. Additionally, Kilmer uses metaphor in the line "A nest of robins in her hair" to liken the tree's branches to hair, adding a layer of beauty and intricacy to the imagery.

### Historical and Personal Context

Joyce Kilmer was known for his devout Catholic faith, and this poem reflects his deep spiritual connection to nature and God. Written during a time when industrialization was rapidly changing the landscape, "Trees" can be seen as a response to the growing disconnect between humans and the natural world. By glorifying the tree as a symbol of God's creation, Kilmer emphasizes the importance of preserving and appreciating the beauty of nature.

### Deep Reading

On a deeper level, "Trees" can be interpreted as a meditation on the limitations of human creativity compared to the boundless creativity of God. The speaker acknowledges their own ability to create poems but recognizes that only God has the power to create something as magnificent and awe-inspiring as a tree. This humility and reverence towards the natural world underscore the poem's overarching theme of the beauty and divinity found in nature.

In conclusion, Joyce Kilmer's "Trees" is a lyrical ode to the beauty and significance of trees, filled with vivid imagery, religious undertones, and a humble acknowledgment of the power of creation. Through its form, structure, themes, and literary devices, the poem invites readers to contemplate the awe-inspiring majesty of the natural world and the divine presence that resides within it.

## No, Thank You John by Christina Rossetti

```
I never said I loved you, John:
Why will you tease me day by day,
And wax a weariness to think upon
With always "do" and "pray"?

You Know I never loved you, John;
No fault of mine made me your toast:
Why will you haunt me with a face as wan
As shows an hour-old ghost?

I dare say Meg or Moll would take
Pity upon you, if you'd ask:
And pray don't remain single for my sake
Who can't perform the task.

I have no heart?-Perhaps I have not;
But then you're mad to take offence
That don't give you what I have not got:
Use your common sense.

Let bygones be bygones:
Don't call me false, who owed not to be true:
I'd rather answer "No" to fifty Johns
Than answer "Yes" to you.

Let's mar our plesant days no more,
Song-birds of passage, days of youth:
Catch at today, forget the days before:
I'll wink at your untruth.

Let us strike hands as hearty friends;
No more, no less; and friendship's good:
Only don't keep in veiw ulterior ends, And points not understood

In open treaty. Rise above
Quibbles and shuffling off and on:
Here's friendship for you if you like; but love,-
No, thank you, John.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

Christina Rossetti's poem "No, Thank You John" is structured as a dramatic monologue, with the speaker directly addressing John throughout the poem. The poem consists of five quatrains, with each stanza following an ABAB rhyme scheme. The consistent rhyme scheme gives the poem a sense of rhythm and unity.

In terms of meter, the poem follows a primarily iambic tetrameter, with four metrical feet per line. This regular meter contributes to the poem's musicality and reinforces the speaker's firm and resolute tone as she rejects John's advances. The use of enjambment, where sentences continue from one line to the next without punctuation, adds to the conversational and flowing nature of the poem.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of "No, Thank You John" revolves around unrequited love and the speaker's firm rejection of John's advances. Through the speaker's repeated assertion that she never loved John, the poem explores themes of honesty, independence, and self-assurance. The imagery in the poem, such as the comparison of John's persistence to a "weariness" and a "ghost," conveys the speaker's feelings of annoyance and discomfort towards his relentless pursuit.

The mention of Meg and Moll as potential alternatives to the speaker highlights the societal expectations and pressures placed on women to fulfill traditional roles. The imagery of "Song-birds of passage" and "days of youth" suggests fleeting moments and the passage of time, emphasizing the speaker's desire to move on from the past and embrace the present.

### Literary Devices

Rossetti employs various literary devices in "No, Thank You John" to enhance the poem's meaning and tone. The use of repetition, as seen in the repeated phrase "I never loved you, John," reinforces the speaker's firm rejection and emphasizes her lack of romantic feelings towards John.

The speaker's use of irony is notable throughout the poem, particularly in lines such as "I'd rather answer 'No' to fifty Johns / Than answer 'Yes' to you." This ironic statement highlights the speaker's preference for honesty and her unwillingness to compromise her feelings for John's sake.

The poem also features imagery, such as the comparison of John's face to that of a "wan" ghost, which conveys the speaker's disinterest and disillusionment with his persistence. Additionally, the metaphor of "Song-birds of passage" symbolizes fleeting moments and the transient nature of youth.

### Historical and Personal Context

Christina Rossetti, a prominent Victorian poet, often explored themes of love, faith, and femininity in her poetry. "No, Thank You John" reflects the societal expectations and constraints placed on women during the Victorian era, where women were expected to conform to traditional gender roles and expectations.

The poem can be seen as a response to the societal pressure for women to prioritize marriage and romantic relationships above personal autonomy and independence. Rossetti's rejection of John's advances highlights the speaker's agency and refusal to be coerced into a romantic relationship against her will.

### Deep Reading

At its core, "No, Thank You John" serves as a powerful assertion of agency and autonomy, with the speaker firmly asserting her independence and freedom to reject John's advances. The speaker's repeated refusal and emphasis on honesty reflect a desire for genuine connections and relationships based on mutual respect rather than societal expectations.

Through the rejection of John's advances and the assertion of friendship over romantic love, Rossetti challenges traditional notions of courtship and romance, presenting a nuanced portrayal of female agency and empowerment. The poem ultimately conveys a message of self-respect, honesty, and the importance of personal boundaries in relationships.
