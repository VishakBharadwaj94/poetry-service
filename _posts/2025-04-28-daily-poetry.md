## Insensibility by Wilfred Owen

```
I

Happy are men who yet before they are killed
Can let their veins run cold.
Whom no compassion fleers
Or makes their feet
Sore on the alleys cobbled with their brothers.
The front line withers,
But they are troops who fade, not flowers
For poets' tearful fooling:
Men, gaps for filling
Losses who might have fought
Longer; but no one bothers.


    II

And some cease feeling
Even themselves or for themselves.
Dullness best solves
The tease and doubt of shelling,
And Chance's strange arithmetic
Comes simpler than the reckoning of their shilling.
They keep no check on Armies' decimation.


    III

Happy are these who lose imagination:
They have enough to carry with ammunition.
Their spirit drags no pack.
Their old wounds save with cold can not more ache.
Having seen all things red,
Their eyes are rid
Of the hurt of the colour of blood for ever.
And terror's first constriction over,
Their hearts remain small drawn.
Their senses in some scorching cautery of battle
Now long since ironed,
Can laugh among the dying, unconcerned.


    IV

Happy the soldier home, with not a notion
How somewhere, every dawn, some men attack,
And many sighs are drained.
Happy the lad whose mind was never trained:
His days are worth forgetting more than not.
He sings along the march
Which we march taciturn, because of dusk,
The long, forlorn, relentless trend
From larger day to huger night.


    V

We wise, who with a thought besmirch
Blood over all our soul,
How should we see our task
But through his blunt and lashless eyes?
Alive, he is not vital overmuch;
Dying, not mortal overmuch;
Nor sad, nor proud,
Nor curious at all.
He cannot tell
Old men's placidity from his.


    VI

But cursed are dullards whom no cannon stuns,
That they should be as stones.
Wretched are they, and mean
With paucity that never was simplicity.
By choice they made themselves immune
To pity and whatever mourns in man
Before the last sea and the hapless stars;
Whatever mourns when many leave these shores;
Whatever shares
The eternal reciprocity of tears.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme
Wilfred Owen's poem "Insensibility" consists of six stanzas, each exploring different aspects of the insensitivity that war can breed in soldiers. The poem is written in free verse, with no consistent rhyme scheme or meter. This lack of formal structure mirrors the chaotic and disordered nature of war itself. The absence of a regular rhyme scheme also adds to the overall feeling of unease and disconnection present in the poem.

### Themes and Imagery
The central theme of "Insensibility" is the emotional numbness and desensitization that can occur as a result of war. Owen explores how soldiers become detached from their own feelings, from the suffering of others, and from the horror of the battlefield. The imagery in the poem is stark and vivid, with references to blood, wounds, and death. Owen paints a bleak picture of the toll that war takes on the human psyche, showing how it can strip away empathy and compassion.

### Literary Devices
Owen employs several literary devices in "Insensibility" to convey the dehumanizing effects of war. One notable device is irony, as the title "Insensibility" suggests a lack of feeling, yet the poem is filled with intense emotions. Owen also uses vivid imagery, such as the description of soldiers whose "eyes are rid of the hurt of the colour of blood forever." This imagery serves to highlight the psychological impact of war on individuals. Additionally, Owen uses repetition in phrases like "happy are" to emphasize the contrast between the soldiers' perceived happiness and the grim reality of their situation.

### Historical and Personal Context
Wilfred Owen was a soldier in World War I, and his poems often reflect his own experiences and observations of the war. "Insensibility" was likely inspired by Owen's firsthand knowledge of the emotional toll that combat takes on soldiers. The poem captures the disillusionment and despair felt by many soldiers during the war, as well as Owen's own struggle to make sense of the senseless violence he witnessed.

### Deep Reading
"Insensibility" delves deep into the psychological and emotional impact of war, showing how it can strip away humanity and leave soldiers numb and detached. Owen's portrayal of soldiers who have lost their ability to feel or empathize is a powerful commentary on the dehumanizing effects of conflict. The poem challenges the romanticized notions of war and heroism, instead revealing the grim reality of suffering and loss. Through its stark imagery and haunting language, "Insensibility" serves as a poignant reminder of the true cost of war on the human soul.

## A Birthday by Christina Rossetti

```
My heart is like a singing bird
Whose nest is in a water'd shoot;
My heart is like an apple-tree
Whose boughs are bent with thickset fruit;
My heart is like a rainbow shell
That paddles in a halcyon sea;
My heart is gladder than all these
Because my love is come to me.

Raise me a dais of silk and down;
Hang it with vair and purple dyes;
Carve it in doves and pomegranates,
And peacocks with a hundred eyes;
Work it in gold and silver grapes,
In leaves and silver fleurs-de-lys;
Because the birthday of my life
Is come, my love is come to me.
```

## I Wandered Lonely As A Cloud by William Wordsworth

```
I wandered lonely as a cloud
That floats on high o'er vales and hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
A host, of golden daffodils;
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.

Continuous as the stars that shine
And twinkle on the milky way,
They stretched in never-ending line
Along the margin of a bay:
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.

 The waves beside them danced, but they
Out-did the sparkling leaves in glee;
A poet could not be but gay,
In such a jocund company!
I gazed—and gazed—but little thought
What wealth the show to me had brought:

For oft, when on my couch I lie
In vacant or in pensive mood,
They flash upon that inward eye
Which is the bliss of solitude;
And then my heart with pleasure fills,
And dances with the daffodils.
```
