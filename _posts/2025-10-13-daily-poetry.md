## Beauty by Edward Thomas

```
WHAT does it mean? Tired, angry, and ill at ease,
No man, woman, or child alive could please
Me now. And yet I almost dare to laugh
Because I sit and frame an epitaph--
"Here lies all that no one loved of him
And that loved no one." Then in a trice that
    whim
Has wearied. But, though I am like a river
At fall of evening while it seems that never
Has the sun lighted it or warmed it, while
Cross breezes cut the surface to a file,
This heart, some fraction of me, happily
Floats through the window even now to a tree
Down in the misting, dim-lit, quiet vale,
Not like a pewit that returns to wail
For something it has lost, but like a dove
That slants unswerving to its home and love.
There I find my rest, and through the dusk air
Flies what yet lives in me. Beauty is there.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "Beauty" by Edward Thomas is written in free verse, with no consistent rhyme scheme or meter. The lack of a strict structure mirrors the speaker's internal turmoil and sense of disconnection from the world around him. The poem consists of a single stanza with varying line lengths, contributing to the sense of unease and restlessness conveyed in the poem.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem revolves around the speaker's feelings of alienation and disconnect from others. The speaker expresses a deep sense of disillusionment and dissatisfaction with life, stating that no one could please him. This feeling is emphasized through the imagery of a river at evening, with its surface cut by cross breezes, reflecting the speaker's internal turbulence and lack of peace.

The imagery of the tree in the misting, dim-lit, quiet vale symbolizes a sense of solace and refuge for the speaker. The dove's unswerving flight to its home and love represents the speaker's longing for a place of belonging and tranquility amidst his inner turmoil.

### Literary Devices

Thomas employs various literary devices to convey the speaker's emotional state. The use of personification is evident in lines such as "Because I sit and frame an epitaph," where the speaker anthropomorphizes his actions. The similes "Not like a pewit that returns to wail / For something it has lost, but like a dove" create vivid comparisons that enhance the reader's understanding of the speaker's emotions.

The repetition of the word "like" in the comparison between the speaker and the river emphasizes the speaker's sense of stagnation and lack of vitality. The contrast between the river's stagnant state and the speaker's heart that "happily / Floats through the window" suggests a glimmer of hope and movement towards a place of beauty and peace.

Written during a time of great social and political change in Europe, the poem may also reflect the disillusionment and alienation felt by many individuals during this period. The speaker's sense of isolation and longing for beauty and connection can be seen as a response to the turbulent times in which Thomas lived.

### Deep Reading

The poem "Beauty" delves into the complexities of human emotions and the search for solace in moments of despair. The speaker's initial feelings of tiredness, anger, and disillusionment give way to a fleeting sense of joy and connection as he imagines his epitaph. However, this momentary reprieve is short-lived, and the speaker finds himself adrift like the river at evening.

Despite his internal turmoil, the speaker finds a sense of peace and beauty in nature, symbolized by the tree in the quiet vale. The imagery of the dove's unswerving flight to its home and love suggests a longing for a place of belonging and comfort. Ultimately, the poem conveys a message of resilience and the enduring power of beauty to provide solace in times of darkness.

## A Dream Within A Dream by Edgar Allan Poe

```
Take this kiss upon the brow!
And, in parting from you now,
Thus much let me avow--
You are not wrong, who deem
That my days have been a dream:
Yet if hope has flown away
In a night, or in a day,
In a vision or in none,
Is it therefore the less _gone_?
_All_ that we see or seem
Is but a dream within a dream.

I stand amid the roar
Of a surf-tormented shore,
And I hold within my hand
Grains of the golden sand--
How few! yet how they creep
Through my fingers to the deep
While I weep--while I weep!
O God! can I not grasp
Them with a tighter clasp?
O God! can I not save
_One_ from the pitiless wave?
Is _all_ that we see or seem
But a dream within a dream?
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem revolves around the ephemeral and illusory nature of reality. Poe reflects on the fleeting nature of time and the inability to hold onto moments and experiences. The imagery of grains of sand slipping through the speaker's fingers symbolizes the passage of time and the inability to grasp onto what is transient. The beach setting, with the "surf-tormented shore," creates a vivid and tumultuous backdrop, reinforcing the idea of life's impermanence and the constant flux of existence.

### Literary Devices

Poe employs several literary devices to enhance the thematic elements of the poem. The repetition of the phrase "dream within a dream" emphasizes the layered nature of reality and suggests that all experiences are ultimately insubstantial. The use of rhetorical questions, such as "O God! can I not grasp...?" and "O God! can I not save...?", conveys the speaker's sense of helplessness and despair in the face of inevitable loss. The metaphor of the sand slipping away acts as a powerful symbol of time slipping through one's grasp, highlighting the futility of trying to hold onto fleeting moments.

### Historical and Personal Context

Edgar Allan Poe, known for his dark and macabre themes, often explored the themes of death, loss, and the transience of life in his works.

Additionally, the poem was published in 1849, near the end of Poe's life, adding a poignant layer of reflection on mortality and the passage of time.

### Deep Reading

The speaker's contemplation of whether all that we perceive is merely an illusion within a larger dream underscores the existential uncertainty that pervades human experience. The poem invites readers to ponder the nature of reality, the fleeting nature of time, and the inevitability of loss. By juxtaposing the idea of dreams within dreams with the tangible imagery of sand slipping away, Poe prompts us to confront the impermanence of life and the intangible nature of reality. Ultimately, the poem leaves us with a sense of profound melancholy and a poignant reminder of the transient nature of our existence.

## Spring Quiet by Christina Rossetti

```
Gone were but the Winter,
Come were but the Spring,
I would go to a covert
Where the birds sing;

Where in the whitethorn
Singeth a thrush,
And a robin sings
In the holly-bush.

Full of fresh scents
Are the budding boughs
Arching high over
A cool green house:

Full of sweet scents,
And whispering air
Which sayeth softly:
"We spread no snare;

"Here dwell in safety,
Here dwell alone,
With a clear stream
And a mossy stone.

"Here the sun shineth
Most shadily;
Here is heard an echo
Of the far sea,
Though far off it be."
```

### Word Suggestions

Consider these word pairs that complement your poem's tone:

- **cold** (Germanic) / **frigid** (Latinate)
  - *While both 'cold' and 'frigid' convey a sense of low temperature, 'cold' is more commonly used in everyday language and has a softer, more familiar tone.

  - **Recommended:** Use the germanic version to enhance your poem's tone

- **hill** (Germanic) / **mount** (Latinate)
  - *'Hill' and 'mount' both refer to elevated land, but 'hill' has a more humble and intimate connotation, often associated with smaller, gentler inclines. In contrast, 'mount' carries a grander and more majestic feeling, suggesting larger and more imposing peaks. Considering the poem's focus on the beauty and melancholy of nature's changes, 'hill' would be more fitting as it conveys a sense of quiet introspection and subtle transformation.*
  - **Recommended:** Use the germanic version to enhance your poem's tone

- **want** (Germanic) / **require** (Latinate)
  - *Although both 'want' and 'require' express a need or desire for something, 'want' tends to convey a softer and more emotional longing, while 'require' is more formal and direct, emphasizing necessity.
