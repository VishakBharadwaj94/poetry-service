## The Soldier by Rupert Brooke

```
If I should die, think only this of me:
That there's some corner of a foreign field
That is for ever England. There shall be
In that rich earth a richer dust concealed;
A dust whom England bore, shaped, made aware,
Gave once her flowers to love, her ways to roam;
A body of England's, breathing English air,
Washed by the rivers, blest by suns of home.
And think, this heart, all evil shed away,
A pulse in the eternal mind, no less
Gives somewhere back the thoughts by England given;
Her sights and sounds; dreams happy as her day;
And laughter, learnt of friends; and gentleness,
In hearts at peace, under an English heaven.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

In terms of form, "The Soldier" by Rupert Brooke follows a traditional sonnet structure with 14 lines. The poem is divided into an octave (the first eight lines) and a sestet (the final six lines). The rhyme scheme is ABABCDCD EFGFGF, typical of a Petrarchan sonnet. The poem is written in iambic pentameter, with each line consisting of five pairs of syllables, where the stress falls on every second syllable.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem revolves around patriotism and the idea of national identity. Brooke explores the concept of sacrifice for one's country and the enduring connection between a soldier and England, even in death. The imagery in the poem is vivid and evocative, creating a sense of nostalgia and longing for the homeland. The foreign field becomes a symbol of England, a place where the soldier's essence remains intertwined with the soil and landscape.

### Literary Devices

Brooke employs various literary devices in "The Soldier" to enhance the poem's meaning and emotional impact. One notable device is personification, as England is portrayed as a nurturing mother figure who shapes and guides her children. The use of metaphors, such as "a body of England's" and "a pulse in the eternal mind," adds depth to the soldier's connection to his homeland. Additionally, the repetition of the word "England" throughout the poem serves to emphasize the soldier's strong bond with his country.

### Historical and Personal Context

Written during World War I, "The Soldier" reflects the patriotic fervor and sense of duty that characterized the era. Rupert Brooke himself served as a soldier in the war and died in 1915. The poem captures the sentiment prevalent among many soldiers at the time, who viewed their sacrifice as a noble and honorable act for their country. The imagery of a soldier's eternal connection to England would have resonated with the readers of that era, who were grappling with the devastation of war.

### Deep Reading

"The Soldier" can be interpreted as a romanticized portrayal of war and sacrifice, glorifying the idea of dying for one's country. However, beneath the patriotic veneer lies a poignant exploration of the individual's yearning for belonging and identity. The soldier's desire to be remembered as a part of England, even in death, speaks to a universal longing for a sense of purpose and connection. The poem raises questions about the true cost of patriotism and the complexities of national identity in times of conflict.

## Hervé Riel by Robert Browning

```
On the sea and at the Hogue, sixteen hundred ninety two,
Did the English fight the French,--woe to France!
And, the thirty-first of May, helter-skelter thro' the blue.
Like a crowd of frightened porpoises a shoal of sharks pursue,
  Came crowding ship on ship to St. Malo on the Rance,
With the English fleet in view.

'Twas the squadron that escaped, with the victor in full chase;
  First and foremost of the drove, in his great ship, Damfreville;
    Close on him fled, great and small,
    Twenty-two good ships in all;
And they signalled to the place
"Help the winners of a race!
  Get us guidance, give us harbor, take us quick--or, quicker still,
  Here's the English can and will!"

Then the pilots of the place put out brisk and leapt on board;
  "Why, what hope or chance have ships like these to pass?" laughed they:
"Rocks to starboard, rocks to port, all the passage scarred and scored,
Shall the '_Formidable_' here, with her twelve and eighty guns
  Think to make the river-mouth by the single narrow way,
Trust to enter where 'tis ticklish for a craft of twenty tons,
    And with flow at full beside?
    Now 'tis slackest ebb of tide.
  Reach the mooring? Rather say,
While rock stands or water runs,
Not a ship will leave the bay!"

Then was called a council straight.
Brief and bitter the debate:
"Here's the English at our heels; would you have them take in tow
All that's left us of the fleet, linked together stern and bow,
For a prize to Plymouth Sound?
Better run the ships aground!"
  (Ended Damfreville his speech).
Not a minute more to wait!
  "Let the Captains all and each
  Shove ashore, then blow up, burn the vessels on the beach!
France must undergo her fate.

"Give the word!" But no such word
Was ever spoke or heard;
  For up stood, for out stepped, for in struck amid all these
--A Captain? A Lieutenant? A Mate--first, second, third?
  No such man of mark, and meet
  With his betters to compete!
  But a simple Breton sailor pressed by Tourville for the fleet,
A poor coasting-pilot he, Hervé Riel the Croisickese.

And, "What mockery or malice have we here?" cries Hervé Riel:
  "Are you mad, you Malouins? Are you cowards, fools, or rogues?
Talk to me of rocks and shoals, me who took the soundings, tell
On my fingers every bank, every shallow, every swell
  'Twixt the offing here and Grève where the river disembogues?
Are you bought by English gold? Is it love the lying's for?
    Morn and eve, night and day,
    Have I piloted your bay,
Entered free and anchored fast at the foot of Solidor.
  Burn the fleet and ruin France? That were worse than fifty Hogues!
    Sirs, they know I speak the truth! Sirs, believe me there's a way!
Only let me lead the line,
  Have the biggest ship to steer,
  Get this '_Formidable_' clear,
Make the others follow mine,
And I lead them, most and least, by a passage I know well,
  Right to Solidor past Grève,
    And there lay them safe and sound;
  And if one ship misbehave,
    --Keel so much as grate the ground.
Why, I've nothing but my life,--here's my head!" cries Hervé Riel.

Not a minute more to wait.
"Steer us in then, small and great!
  Take the helm, lead the line, save the squadron!" cried its chief.
Captains, give the sailor place!
  He is Admiral, in brief.

Still the north-wind, by God's grace!
See the noble fellow's face
As the big ship, with a bound,
Clears the entry like a hound,
Keeps the passage as its inch of way were the wide sea's profound!
  See, safe thro' shoal and rock,
  How they follow in a flock,
Not a ship that misbehaves, not a keel that grates the ground,
  Not a spar that comes to grief!
The peril, see, is past,
All are harboured to the last,
And just as Hervé Kiel hollas "Anchor!"--sure as fate
Up the English come, too late!

So, the storm subsides to calm:
  They see the green trees wave
  On the heights o'erlooking Grève.
Hearts that bled are staunched with balm.
"Just our rapture to enhance,
  Let the English rake the bay,
Gnash their teeth and glare askance
  As they cannonade away!
'Neath rampired Solidor pleasant riding on the Rance!"
How hope succeeds despair on each Captain's countenance!
Out burst all with one accord,
  "This is Paradise for Hell!
    Let France, let France's King
    Thank the man that did the thing!"
What a shout, and all one word,
    "Hervé Riel!"
As he stepped in front once more,
  Not a symptom of surprise
  In the frank blue Breton eyes,
Just the same man as before.

Then said Damfreville, "My friend,
I must speak out at the end,
  Tho' I find the speaking hard.
Praise is deeper than the lips:
You have saved the King his ships,
  You must name your own reward,
'Faith our sun was near eclipse!
Demand whate'er you will,
France remains your debtor still.
Ask to heart's content and have! or my name's not Damfreville."

Then a beam of fun outbroke
On the bearded mouth that spoke,
As the honest heart laughed through
Those frank eyes of Breton blue:
"Since I needs must say my say,
  Since on board the duty's done,
  And from Malo Roads to Croisic Point, what is it but a run?--
Since 'tis ask and have, I may--
Since the others go ashore--
Come! A good whole holiday!
  Leave to go and see my wife, whom I call the Belle Aurore!"
That he asked and that he got,--nothing more.

Name and deed alike are lost:
Not a pillar nor a post
  In his Croisic keeps alive the feat as it befell;
Not a head in white and black
On a single fishing smack,
In memory of the man but for whom had gone to wrack
  All that France saved from the fight whence England bore the bell.
Go to Paris: rank on rank.
  Search, the heroes flung pell-mell
On the Louvre, face and flank!
  You shall look long enough ere you come to Hervé Riel.
So, for better and for worse,
Hervé Riel, accept my verse!
In my verse, Hervé Riel, do thou once more
Save the squadron, honour France, love thy wife the Belle Aurore!
```

## A Day Dream by Emily Bronte

```
On a sunny brae, alone I lay
One summer afternoon;
It was the marriage-time of May
With her young lover, June.

From her mother's heart, seemed loath to part
That queen of bridal charms,
But her father smiled on the fairest child
He ever held in his arms.

The trees did wave their plumy crests,
The glad birds caroled clear;
And I, of all the wedding guests,
Was only sullen there!

There was not one, but wished to shun
My aspect void of cheer;
The very grey rocks, looking on,
Asked, "What do you here?"

And I could utter no reply;
In sooth, I did not know
Why I had brought a clouded eye
To greet the general glow.

So, resting on a heathy bank,
I took my heart to me;
And we together sadly sank
Into a reverie.

We thought, "When winter comes again,
Where will these bright things be?
All vanished, like a vision vain,
An unreal mockery!

The birds that now so blithely sing,
Through deserts, frozen dry,
Poor spectres of the perished spring,
In famished troops, will fly.

And why should we be glad at all?
The leaf is hardly green,
Before a token of its fall
Is on the surface seen!"

Now, whether it were really so,
I never could be sure;
But as in fit of peevish woe,
I stretched me on the moor.

A thousand thousand gleaming fires
Seemed kindling in the air;
A thousand thousand silvery lyres
Resounded far and near:

Methought, the very breath I breathed
Was full of sparks divine,
And all my heather-couch was wreathed
By that celestial shine!

And, while the wide earth echoing rung
To their strange minstrelsy,
The little glittering spirits sung,
Or seemed to sing, to me.

"O mortal! mortal! let them die;
Let time and tears destroy,
That we may overflow the sky
With universal joy!

Let grief distract the sufferer's breast,
And night obscure his way;
They hasten him to endless rest,
And everlasting day.

To thee the world is like a tomb,
A desert's naked shore;
To us, in unimagined bloom,
It brightens more and more!

And could we lift the veil, and give
One brief glimpse to thine eye,
Thou wouldst rejoice for those that live,
Because they live to die."

The music ceased; the noonday dream,
Like dream of night, withdrew;
But Fancy, still, will sometimes deem
Her fond creation true.
```

The poem is written in iambic tetrameter, with each line containing four metrical feet. This consistent structure helps to give the poem a sense of rhythm and flow, enhancing the reading experience.

### Themes and Imagery
One of the central themes of the poem is the contrast between the fleeting nature of beauty and the eternal nature of the spiritual world. The speaker observes the beauty of nature and the joyous celebration of the wedding between May and June, but is overcome by a sense of melancholy and a realization of the transience of life. The imagery in the poem is vivid and evocative, with descriptions of the sunny brae, the plumy crests of the trees, and the gleaming fires and silvery lyres in the air. These images serve to create a dreamlike atmosphere and emphasize the contrast between the physical world and the spiritual realm.

### Literary Devices
Bronte employs several literary devices in the poem to enhance its meaning and impact. One of the key devices used is personification, as the speaker anthropomorphizes nature, such as when the grey rocks ask the speaker why they are there. The use of symbolism is also evident, with the bright things of summer representing fleeting beauty and the winter symbolizing death and decay. The poem also contains elements of alliteration, as seen in phrases like "plumy crests" and "sullen there," which add to the musicality of the poem.

### Historical and Personal Context
Emily Bronte, best known for her novel "Wuthering Heights," was part of the famous Bronte literary family in the 19th century. Her works often explored themes of nature, spirituality, and the human experience. "A Day Dream" reflects Bronte's fascination with the natural world and her contemplation of deeper philosophical and spiritual questions. The poem captures the Romantic ideals of finding beauty and meaning in nature, while also acknowledging the darker aspects of existence.

### Deep Reading
Through "A Day Dream," Bronte delves into the complex interplay between beauty, mortality, and the transcendent. The speaker's initial despondency and sense of detachment from the celebratory scene highlight a disconnect between the temporal world and the eternal realm. The celestial imagery and the voices of the spirits convey a message of acceptance and even celebration of the cycle of life and death. The poem ultimately suggests that embracing mortality and recognizing the impermanence of earthly beauty can lead to a deeper appreciation of the spiritual and eternal aspects of existence. Bronte invites readers to contemplate the interconnectedness of life and death, beauty and decay, in a way that is both poignant and thought-provoking.
