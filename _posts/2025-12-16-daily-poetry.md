## To Zante by Edgar Allan Poe

```
Fair isle, that from the fairest of all flowers,
  Thy gentlest of all gentle names dost take!
How many memories of what radiant hours
  At sight of thee and thine at once awake!
How many scenes of what departed bliss!
  How many thoughts of what entombed hopes!
How many visions of a maiden that is
  No more--no more upon thy verdant slopes!

_No more!_ alas, that magical sad sound
  Transforming all! Thy charms shall please _no more_--
Thy memory _no more!_ Accursed ground
  Henceforward I hold thy flower-enamelled shore,
O hyacinthine isle! O purple Zante!
  "Isola d'oro! Fior di Levante!"
```

## Gone, Gone Again by Edward Thomas

```
GONE, gone again,
May, June, July,
And August gone,
Again gone by,

Not memorable
Save that I saw them go,
As past the empty quays
The rivers flow.

And now again,
In the harvest rain,
The Blenheim oranges
Fall grubby from the trees,

As when I was young--
And when the lost one was here--
And when the war began
To turn young men to dung.

Look at the old house,
Outmoded, dignified,
Dark and untenanted,
With grass growing instead

Of the footsteps of life,
The friendliness, the strife;
In its beds have lain
Youth, love, age and pain:

I am something like that;
Only I am not dead,
Still breathing and interested
In the house that is not dark:--

I am something like that:
Not one pane to reflect the sun,
For the schoolboys to throw at--
They have broken every one.
```

## To -- by Percy Bysshe Shelley

```
I fear thy kisses, gentle maiden,
Thou needest not fear mine;

Ever to burthen thine.

Innocent is the heart's devotion
With which I worship thine.
