## 'Tis One by One -- the Father counts -- by Emily Dickinson

```
'Tis One by One -- the Father counts --
And then a Tract between
Set Cypherless -- to teach the Eye
The Value of its Ten --

Until the peevish Student
Acquire the Quick of Skill --
Then Numerals are dowered back --
Adorning all the Rule --

'Tis mostly Slate and Pencil --
And Darkness on the School
Distracts the Children's fingers --
Still the Eternal Rule

Regards least Cypherer alike
With Leader of the Band --
And every separate Urchin's Sum --
Is fashioned for his hand --
```

## Insensibility by Wilfred Owen

```
I

Happy are men who yet before they are killed
Can let their veins run cold.
Whom no compassion fleers
Or makes their feet
Sore on the alleys cobbled with their brothers.
The front line withers,
But they are troops who fade, not flowers
For poets' tearful fooling:
Men, gaps for filling
Losses who might have fought
Longer; but no one bothers.


    II

And some cease feeling
Even themselves or for themselves.
Dullness best solves
The tease and doubt of shelling,
And Chance's strange arithmetic
Comes simpler than the reckoning of their shilling.
They keep no check on Armies' decimation.


    III

Happy are these who lose imagination:
They have enough to carry with ammunition.
Their spirit drags no pack.
Their old wounds save with cold can not more ache.
Having seen all things red,
Their eyes are rid
Of the hurt of the colour of blood for ever.
And terror's first constriction over,
Their hearts remain small drawn.
Their senses in some scorching cautery of battle
Now long since ironed,
Can laugh among the dying, unconcerned.


    IV

Happy the soldier home, with not a notion
How somewhere, every dawn, some men attack,
And many sighs are drained.
Happy the lad whose mind was never trained:
His days are worth forgetting more than not.
He sings along the march
Which we march taciturn, because of dusk,
The long, forlorn, relentless trend
From larger day to huger night.


    V

We wise, who with a thought besmirch
Blood over all our soul,
How should we see our task
But through his blunt and lashless eyes?
Alive, he is not vital overmuch;
Dying, not mortal overmuch;
Nor sad, nor proud,
Nor curious at all.
He cannot tell
Old men's placidity from his.


    VI

But cursed are dullards whom no cannon stuns,
That they should be as stones.
Wretched are they, and mean
With paucity that never was simplicity.
By choice they made themselves immune
To pity and whatever mourns in man
Before the last sea and the hapless stars;
Whatever mourns when many leave these shores;
Whatever shares
The eternal reciprocity of tears.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

Wilfred Owen's poem "Insensibility" is structured into six stanzas, each exploring different aspects of insensibility in the context of war. The poem does not adhere to a specific rhyme scheme, allowing the focus to be on the content rather than the form. Each stanza varies in length and focuses on a different facet of insensibility, creating a fragmented and disjointed feel that mirrors the fragmented experiences of soldiers in war.

The meter of the poem is predominantly iambic pentameter, with lines like "Happy are men who yet before they are killed" maintaining a regular rhythm. However, Owen deviates from this regular meter at times, such as in the line "But they are troops who fade, not flowers," where the meter is disrupted to emphasize the contrast between soldiers and the traditional romanticized image of flowers.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of "Insensibility" is the emotional numbness that war can bring upon soldiers. Owen explores the idea that being devoid of feeling and compassion can be a form of survival in the face of the horrors of war. The poem contrasts the idealized notions of heroism and glory with the harsh reality of soldiers who become desensitized to violence and suffering.

Imagery plays a crucial role in conveying the theme of insensibility. Owen uses vivid and brutal imagery, such as "alleys cobbled with their brothers" and "scorching cautery of battle," to depict the physical and emotional toll of war on soldiers. The repeated references to blood, wounds, and death create a stark contrast to the romanticized images of war often portrayed in literature.

### Literary Devices

Owen employs several literary devices to convey the theme of insensibility effectively. One notable device is irony, as seen in lines like "Happy are men who yet before they are killed," where happiness in the face of death is portrayed as a form of insensibility. The poem also utilizes imagery, metaphor, and personification to evoke the dehumanizing effects of war and the loss of empathy among soldiers.

Repetition is another key literary device in "Insensibility," with phrases like "Happy are" and "Their spirit drags no pack" recurring throughout the poem to emphasize the theme of emotional detachment. Owen's use of caesura and enjambment creates a sense of fragmentation and disjointedness, mirroring the chaotic and disorienting nature of war.

### Historical and Personal Context

Wilfred Owen was a British poet who served as a soldier in World War I, and his firsthand experiences of the brutality and senselessness of war deeply influenced his poetry. "Insensibility" reflects Owen's disillusionment with the glorification of war and his condemnation of the emotional numbness that it can induce in soldiers. The poem critiques the romanticized notions of heroism and sacrifice associated with war, highlighting the psychological toll it takes on those who experience it.

Owen's personal context as a soldier in World War I lends authenticity and emotional depth to his portrayal of war in "Insensibility." The poem serves as a poignant reminder of the human cost of conflict and the dehumanizing effects of violence on individuals.

### Deep Reading

"Insensibility" challenges the conventional narratives of heroism and sacrifice in war by presenting insensibility as a coping mechanism for soldiers faced with unimaginable horrors. Owen's depiction of emotional numbness and detachment as a form of self-preservation sheds light on the psychological complexities of war and the toll it takes on individuals.

The poem's fragmented structure and stark imagery create a sense of disconnection and alienation, mirroring the psychological state of soldiers who have become desensitized to violence. Through its exploration of insensibility, Owen raises important questions about the nature of empathy, compassion, and humanity in the context of war.

Overall, "Insensibility" is a powerful and thought-provoking exploration of the emotional toll of war and the ways in which individuals cope with trauma and suffering. Owen's stark depiction of insensibility challenges the romanticized ideals of war and calls attention to the human cost of conflict.

## Mother and Poet by Elizabeth Barrett Browning

```
I.

Dead ! One of them shot by the sea in the east,
And one of them shot in the west by the sea.
Dead ! both my boys ! When you sit at the feast
And are wanting a great song for Italy free,
Let none look at me !

II.
Yet I was a poetess only last year,
And good at my art, for a woman, men said ;
But this woman, this, who is agonized here,
-- The east sea and west sea rhyme on in her head
For ever instead.

III.
What art can a woman be good at ? Oh, vain !
What art is she good at, but hurting her breast
With the milk-teeth of babes, and a smile at the pain ?
Ah boys, how you hurt ! you were strong as you pressed,
And I proud, by that test.

IV.
What art's for a woman ? To hold on her knees
Both darlings ! to feel all their arms round her throat,
Cling, strangle a little ! to sew by degrees
And 'broider the long-clothes and neat little coat ;
To dream and to doat.

V.
To teach them ... It stings there ! I made them indeed
Speak plain the word country. I taught them, no doubt,
That a country's a thing men should die for at need.
I prated of liberty, rights, and about
The tyrant cast out.

VI.
And when their eyes flashed ... O my beautiful eyes ! ...
I exulted ; nay, let them go forth at the wheels
Of the guns, and denied not. But then the surprise
When one sits quite alone ! Then one weeps, then one kneels !
God, how the house feels !

VII.
At first, happy news came, in gay letters moiled
With my kisses, -- of camp-life and glory, and how
They both loved me ; and, soon coming home to be spoiled
In return would fan off every fly from my brow
With their green laurel-bough.

VIII.
Then was triumph at Turin : `Ancona was free !'
And some one came out of the cheers in the street,
With a face pale as stone, to say something to me.
My Guido was dead ! I fell down at his feet,
While they cheered in the street.

IX.
I bore it ; friends soothed me ; my grief looked sublime
As the ransom of Italy. One boy remained
To be leant on and walked with, recalling the time
When the first grew immortal, while both of us strained
To the height he had gained.

X.
And letters still came, shorter, sadder, more strong,
Writ now but in one hand, `I was not to faint, --
One loved me for two -- would be with me ere long :
And Viva l' Italia ! -- he died for, our saint,
Who forbids our complaint."

XI.
My Nanni would add, `he was safe, and aware
Of a presence that turned off the balls, -- was imprest
It was Guido himself, who knew what I could bear,
And how 'twas impossible, quite dispossessed,
To live on for the rest."

XII.
On which, without pause, up the telegraph line
Swept smoothly the next news from Gaeta : -- Shot.
Tell his mother. Ah, ah, ` his, ' ` their ' mother, -- not ` mine, '
No voice says "My mother" again to me. What !
You think Guido forgot ?

XIII.
Are souls straight so happy that, dizzy with Heaven,
They drop earth's affections, conceive not of woe ?
I think not. Themselves were too lately forgiven
Through THAT Love and Sorrow which reconciled so
The Above and Below.

XIV.
O Christ of the five wounds, who look'dst through the dark
To the face of Thy mother ! consider, I pray,
How we common mothers stand desolate, mark,
Whose sons, not being Christs, die with eyes turned away,
And no last word to say !

XV.
Both boys dead ? but that's out of nature. We all
Have been patriots, yet each house must always keep one.
'Twere imbecile, hewing out roads to a wall ;
And, when Italy 's made, for what end is it done
If we have not a son ?

XVI.
Ah, ah, ah ! when Gaeta's taken, what then ?
When the fair wicked queen sits no more at her sport
Of the fire-balls of death crashing souls out of men ?
When the guns of Cavalli with final retort
Have cut the game short ?

XVII.
When Venice and Rome keep their new jubilee,
When your flag takes all heaven for its white, green, and red,
When you have your country from mountain to sea,
When King Victor has Italy's crown on his head,
(And I have my Dead) --

XVIII.
What then ? Do not mock me. Ah, ring your bells low,
And burn your lights faintly ! My country is there,
Above the star pricked by the last peak of snow :
My Italy 's THERE, with my brave civic Pair,
To disfranchise despair !

XIX.
Forgive me. Some women bear children in strength,
And bite back the cry of their pain in self-scorn ;
But the birth-pangs of nations will wring us at length
Into wail such as this -- and we sit on forlorn
When the man-child is born.

XX.
Dead ! One of them shot by the sea in the east,
And one of them shot in the west by the sea.
Both ! both my boys ! If in keeping the feast
You want a great song for your Italy free,
Let none look at me !


[This was Laura Savio, of Turin, a poetess and patriot, whose sonswere killed at Ancona and Gaeta.]
