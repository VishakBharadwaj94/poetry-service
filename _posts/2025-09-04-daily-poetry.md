## No, Thank You John by Christina Rossetti

```
I never said I loved you, John:
Why will you tease me day by day,
And wax a weariness to think upon
With always "do" and "pray"?

You Know I never loved you, John;
No fault of mine made me your toast:
Why will you haunt me with a face as wan
As shows an hour-old ghost?

I dare say Meg or Moll would take
Pity upon you, if you'd ask:
And pray don't remain single for my sake
Who can't perform the task.

I have no heart?-Perhaps I have not;
But then you're mad to take offence
That don't give you what I have not got:
Use your common sense.

Let bygones be bygones:
Don't call me false, who owed not to be true:
I'd rather answer "No" to fifty Johns
Than answer "Yes" to you.

Let's mar our plesant days no more,
Song-birds of passage, days of youth:
Catch at today, forget the days before:
I'll wink at your untruth.

Let us strike hands as hearty friends;
No more, no less; and friendship's good:
Only don't keep in veiw ulterior ends, And points not understood

In open treaty. Rise above
Quibbles and shuffling off and on:
Here's friendship for you if you like; but love,-
No, thank you, John.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "No, Thank You John" by Christina Rossetti consists of three stanzas, each containing seven lines. The rhyme scheme is ABABCCB, with alternating rhymes in the first four lines, a couplet in the fifth and sixth lines, and a single line to conclude each stanza. The consistent rhyme scheme creates a sense of musicality and rhythm throughout the poem. 

In terms of meter, the poem is written in iambic tetrameter, with four iambs (unstressed syllable followed by a stressed syllable) per line. This steady meter contributes to the poem's overall flow and readability.

The structure of the poem is fairly simple, with each stanza serving as a self-contained unit, but also contributing to the overall message of the poem. The repetition of the title phrase "No, Thank You John" at the end of each stanza reinforces the speaker's firm rejection of John's advances.

### Themes and Imagery

The main theme of the poem is rejection and independence. The speaker, presumably a woman, asserts her agency and autonomy in refusing John's advances. The imagery in the poem reinforces this theme, with references to haunting ghosts, heartlessness, and the passage of time. The speaker's refusal to be pressured into a relationship she does not desire is a powerful assertion of self-determination.

The poem also touches on the theme of friendship and the boundaries between friendship and romantic love. The speaker offers John friendship, but draws a clear line at romantic involvement. This distinction between friendship and love is a key aspect of the speaker's rejection of John's advances.

### Literary Devices

Rossetti employs several literary devices in the poem to convey the speaker's rejection and independence. One such device is repetition, with the phrase "No, Thank You John" serving as a refrain that emphasizes the speaker's firm stance. The use of simile, as in "With always 'do' and 'pray'?" compares John's persistence to a wearisome task, highlighting the speaker's lack of interest.

The use of personification is also evident in lines such as "Song-birds of passage, days of youth," where the passage of time and fleeting nature of youth are given human-like qualities. This personification adds depth to the imagery in the poem and enhances the thematic elements of time and change.

### Historical and Personal Context

Christina Rossetti was a Victorian poet known for her introspective and often religiously themed poetry. In the context of the Victorian era, where women's roles were often restricted to domestic spheres and marriage was considered a primary goal, the speaker's rejection of John's advances can be seen as a subversion of societal expectations. Rossetti herself never married, and her poetry often explored themes of love, rejection, and independence.

The poem can also be read in the context of Rossetti's personal experiences. As a devout Christian, she may have struggled with the societal pressure to marry and conform to traditional gender roles. The speaker's refusal to be pressured into a relationship she does not desire may reflect Rossetti's own views on love and independence.

### Deep Reading

At its core, "No, Thank You John" is a defiant assertion of the speaker's autonomy and refusal to be coerced into a relationship she does not want. The repeated phrase "No, Thank You John" serves as a powerful declaration of agency and self-respect. The speaker's insistence on friendship without romantic entanglement underscores her desire for independence and freedom from societal expectations.

The poem can also be seen as a commentary on the nature of love and friendship. The speaker distinguishes between the two, suggesting that friendship can exist without romantic love and that it is important to establish clear boundaries in relationships. By rejecting John's advances but offering friendship, the speaker asserts her right to define the terms of her relationships on her own terms.

Overall, "No, Thank You John" is a nuanced exploration of rejection, independence, and the boundaries between friendship and romantic love. Rossetti's skillful use of form, imagery, and literary devices enhances the poem's themes and reinforces the speaker's strong, assertive voice.

## The Chalk-Pit by Edward Thomas

```
"Is this the road that climbs above and bends
Round what was once a chalk-pit: now it is
By accident an amphitheatre.
Some ash-trees standing ankle-deep in brier
And bramble act the parts, and neither speak
Nor stir." "But see: they have fallen, every one,
And brier and bramble have grown over them."
"That is the place. As usual no one is here.
Hardly can I imagine the drop of the axe,
And the smack that is like an echo, sounding here."
"I do not understand." "Why, what I mean is
That I have seen the place two or three times
At most, and that its emptiness and silence
And stillness haunt me, as if just before
It was not empty, silent, still, but full
Of life of some kind, perhaps tragical.
Has anything unusual happened here?"
"Not that I know of. It is called the Dell.
They have not dug chalk here for a century.
That was the ash-trees' age. But I will ask."
"No. Do not. I prefer to make a tale,
Or better leave it like the end of a play,
Actors and audience and lights all gone;
For so it looks now. In my memory
Again and again I see it, strangely dark,
And vacant of a life but just withdrawn.
We have not seen the woodman with the axe.
Some ghost has left it now as we two came."
"And yet you doubted if this were the road?"
"Well, sometimes I have thought of it and failed
To place it. No. And I am not quite sure,
Even now, this is it. For another place,
Real or painted, may have combined with it.
Or I myself a long way back in time . . ."
"Why, as to that, I used to meet a man--
I had forgotten,--searching for birds' nests
Along the road and in the chalk-pit too.
The wren's hole was an eye that looked at him
For recognition. Every nest he knew.
He got a stiff neck, by looking this side or that,
Spring after spring, he told me, with his laugh,--
A sort of laugh. He was a visitor,
A man of forty,--smoked and strolled about.
At orts and crosses Pleasure and Pain had played
On his brown features;--I think both had lost;--
Mild and yet wild too. You may know the kind.
And once or twice a woman shared his walks,
A girl of twenty with a brown boy's face,
And hair brown as a thrush or as a nut,
Thick eyebrows, glinting eyes--" "You have
    said enough.
A pair,--free thought, free love,--I know the
    breed:
I shall not mix my fancies up with them."
"You please yourself. I should prefer the truth
Or nothing. Here, in fact, is nothing at all
Except a silent place that once rang loud,
And trees and us--imperfect friends, we men
And trees since time began; and nevertheless
Between us still we breed a mystery."
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "The Chalk-Pit" by Edward Thomas is written in free verse, without a specific rhyme scheme or meter. The lack of a consistent rhyme scheme and meter adds to the conversational and contemplative tone of the poem, allowing for a more natural and fluid expression of the speaker's thoughts and reflections. The poem is divided into a dialogue between two speakers, allowing for a back-and-forth exchange of ideas and observations about the chalk-pit.

### Themes and Imagery

The poem explores themes of memory, emptiness, silence, and the passage of time. The imagery of the abandoned chalk-pit, overgrown with brier and bramble, serves as a metaphor for the transience of life and the impermanence of human presence. The ash-trees, once standing tall, now fallen and covered with vegetation, symbolize the cycle of life and decay. The dialogue between the two speakers hints at a sense of unease and mystery surrounding the place, suggesting that something tragic may have happened there in the past.

### Literary Devices

Thomas employs various literary devices in the poem, including imagery, personification, and metaphor. The ash-trees "standing ankle-deep in brier And bramble act the parts," personifying the trees and creating a sense of theatricality in the scene. The imagery of the deserted chalk-pit, with its echoes of the past and haunting stillness, evokes a sense of melancholy and nostalgia. The metaphor of the chalk-pit as an amphitheatre adds a layer of symbolism to the setting, hinting at the idea of past dramas and events that have now faded into obscurity.

### Historical and Personal Context

Edward Thomas, the poet, was known for his keen observations of nature and his introspective reflections on the human experience. "The Chalk-Pit" reflects Thomas's interest in the English countryside and his exploration of themes related to memory, loss, and the passage of time. The poem captures a sense of nostalgia for a bygone era when the chalk-pit was still in use, while also acknowledging the inevitability of change and decay over time. Thomas's personal experiences and observations likely informed his depiction of the landscape and the dialogue between the two speakers.

### Deep Reading

The poem "The Chalk-Pit" can be read as a meditation on the fragility of human existence and the ways in which the past lingers in the present. The empty and silent chalk-pit, once a place of activity and noise, now stands as a testament to the passage of time and the impermanence of human endeavors. The dialogue between the two speakers hints at a sense of unease and mystery surrounding the place, suggesting that the memory of past events still haunts the landscape. Through its evocative imagery and contemplative tone, the poem invites readers to reflect on the interconnectedness of nature, history, and human experience, and the enduring mysteries that lie beneath the surface of the seemingly ordinary.

## Apology by Joyce Kilmer

```
(For Eleanor Rogers Cox)

For blows on the fort of evil
That never shows a breach,
For terrible life-long races
To a goal no foot can reach,
For reckless leaps into darkness
With hands outstretched to a star,
There is jubilation in Heaven
Where the great dead poets are.
There is joy over disappointment
And delight in hopes that were vain.
Each poet is glad there was no cure
To stop his lonely pain.
For nothing keeps a poet
In his high singing mood
Like unappeasable hunger
For unattainable food.
So fools are glad of the folly
That made them weep and sing,
And Keats is thankful for Fanny Brawne
And Drummond for his king.
They know that on flinty sorrow
And failure and desire
The steel of their souls was hammered
To bring forth the lyric fire.
Lord Byron and Shelley and Plunkett,
McDonough and Hunt and Pearse
See now why their hatred of tyrants
Was so insistently fierce.
Is Freedom only a Will-o'-the-wisp
To cheat a poet's eye?
Be it phantom or fact, it's a noble cause
In which to sing and to die!
So not for the Rainbow taken
And the magical White Bird snared
The poets sing grateful carols
In the place to which they have fared;
But for their lifetime's passion,
The quest that was fruitless and long,
They chorus their loud thanksgiving
To the thorn-crowned Master of Song.
```

The poem consists of three stanzas, each addressing different aspects of the poet's experience.

### Themes and Imagery

Kilmer celebrates the poets who endured hardship, disappointment, and unattainable desires in their pursuit of art.

### Literary Devices

Kilmer employs various literary devices to enhance the poem's meaning. One notable device is personification, as he describes "jubilation in Heaven" and "joy over disappointment." These personifications serve to elevate the struggles of the poets to a divine level, suggesting that their sacrifices are worthy of celebration. Additionally, the use of alliteration in phrases like "terrible life-long races" and "flinty sorrow" adds musicality to the poem and emphasizes key ideas.

### Historical and Personal Context
