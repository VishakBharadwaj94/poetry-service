## Common Things by Paul Laurence Dunbar

```
I like to hear of wealth and gold,
And El Doradoes in their glory;
I like for silks and satins bold
To sweep and rustle through a story.

The nightingale is sweet of song;
The rare exotic smells divinely;
And knightly men who stride along,
The role heroic carry finely.

But then, upon the other hand,
Our minds have got a way of running
To things that aren't quite so grand,
Which, maybe, we are best in shunning.

For some of us still like to see
The poor man in his dwelling narrow,
The hollyhock, the bumblebee,
The meadow lark, and chirping sparrow.

We like the man who soars and sings
With high and lofty inspiration;
But he who sings of common things
Shall always share our admiration.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "Common Things" by Paul Laurence Dunbar consists of three stanzas, each with eight lines. The rhyme scheme in each stanza is ABABCDCD. This consistent rhyme scheme gives the poem a sense of balance and structure. The meter is mostly iambic, with alternating lines of tetrameter and trimeter, creating a rhythmic flow. The poem's form is traditional and tightly structured, reflecting the poet's deliberate choice to convey his message in a controlled and organized manner.

### Themes and Imagery

One of the central themes of the poem is the contrast between the grandeur of wealth and luxury, and the beauty found in common, everyday things. Dunbar expresses a preference for simplicity and modesty over extravagance and opulence. The use of imagery throughout the poem helps to illustrate this theme. For example, the mention of "silks and satins bold" and "El Doradoes in their glory" in the first stanza portrays a desire for riches and luxury. In contrast, the imagery of "the poor man in his dwelling narrow," "the hollyhock, the bumblebee," and the "chirping sparrow" in the second stanza celebrates the beauty of ordinary, everyday life.

### Literary Devices

Dunbar employs several literary devices to convey his message effectively. One notable device is contrast, which is evident throughout the poem. The contrast between wealth and poverty, grandeur and simplicity, and heroism and commonality serves to highlight the poet's preference for the latter. Another device used is imagery, which helps to paint vivid pictures in the reader's mind. The nightingale's sweet song, the exotic smells, and the knightly men all evoke sensory experiences that enhance the themes of the poem. Additionally, the use of metaphor is present in lines such as "But he who sings of common things / Shall always share our admiration," where singing symbolizes the act of celebrating and appreciating the ordinary aspects of life.

### Historical and Personal Context

Paul Laurence Dunbar, an African American poet writing in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, often explored themes of race, class, and identity in his work. In "Common Things," Dunbar's personal experiences as a black man in a society marked by racial inequality likely influenced his celebration of the simple, everyday aspects of life. The poem can be seen as a commentary on the societal emphasis on wealth and luxury, as well as a reflection of Dunbar's own values and beliefs regarding the beauty found in common, humble things.

### Deep Reading

On a deeper level, "Common Things" can be interpreted as a call to appreciate the beauty and value in the ordinary aspects of life. While the world may idolize wealth, heroism, and grandeur, Dunbar suggests that true admiration should be reserved for those who find inspiration in everyday experiences. By highlighting the beauty of the "chirping sparrow" and the "meadow lark," the poet emphasizes the profound impact that simple, common things can have on our lives. Ultimately, the poem encourages readers to find joy and fulfillment in the simplicity of the world around them, rather than constantly striving for material wealth or societal recognition.

## Sonnet.  to a Balloon Laden With Knowledge by Percy Bysshe Shelley

```
Bright ball of flame that through the gloom of even
Silently takest thine aethereal way,
And with surpassing glory dimm'st each ray
Twinkling amid the dark blue depths of Heaven,--
Unlike the fire thou bearest, soon shalt thou
Fade like a meteor in surrounding gloom,
Whilst that, unquenchable, is doomed to glow
A watch-light by the patriot's lonely tomb;
A ray of courage to the oppressed and poor;
A spark, though gleaming on the hovel's hearth,
Which through the tyrant's gilded domes shall roar;
A beacon in the darkness of the Earth;
A sun which, o'er the renovated scene,
Shall dart like Truth where Falsehood yet has been.
```

The balloon, symbolizing fleeting human endeavors and achievements, is juxtaposed with the eternal nature of knowledge and truth. The imagery of the "bright ball of flame" soaring through the sky evokes a sense of majesty and transcendence, while the references to darkness and gloom highlight the contrast between temporary fame and lasting impact. Through vivid imagery, Shelley conveys the idea that knowledge and truth have the power to outlast transient human endeavors.

### Literary Devices

Shelley employs various literary devices to enhance the poem's meaning and impact. The use of personification is evident in lines such as "Fade like a meteor in surrounding gloom," where the balloon is given human-like qualities of fading and disappearing. Alliteration is also utilized throughout the poem, such as in the phrase "surpassing glory dimm'st," adding a musical quality to the verses. Additionally, symbolism is prevalent in the poem, with the balloon representing human achievements and the light it carries symbolizing knowledge and truth. These literary devices work together to create a rich and layered text.

Shelley himself was a radical thinker and a passionate advocate for social justice, which is reflected in the poem's references to courage, oppression, and tyranny. The imagery of a "beacon in the darkness of the Earth" can be seen as a metaphor for Shelley's own belief in the transformative power of knowledge and truth in the face of injustice and inequality. The poem can be interpreted as a call to action for social change and a reminder of the enduring power of enlightenment.
