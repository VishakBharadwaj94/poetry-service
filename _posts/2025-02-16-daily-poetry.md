## "Faith" is a fine invention by Emily Dickinson

```
"Faith" is a fine invention
When Gentlemen can see --
But Microscopes are prudent
In an Emergency.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "Faith" is a fine invention by Emily Dickinson consists of four lines divided into two couplets. It follows a simple rhyme scheme of AABB, with the end words of the first and second lines rhyming, as well as the end words of the third and fourth lines. The structure is concise and compact, reflecting the straightforward nature of the message being conveyed. In terms of meter, the poem does not strictly adhere to a specific meter, but there is a sense of rhythm and balance in the way the lines are constructed.

### Themes and Imagery

The overarching theme of the poem revolves around the contrast between faith and science, specifically the idea of relying on faith versus using empirical evidence. The speaker suggests that while faith may be a valuable belief system for some, in times of crisis or "emergency," it is more practical to turn to scientific instruments like microscopes for a clearer understanding of the situation. The imagery of "Microscopes" implies a closer examination or scrutiny of the world, suggesting that a scientific approach is more reliable and pragmatic in critical situations.

### Literary Devices

One of the key literary devices used in the poem is irony. The title itself, "Faith" is a fine invention, sets up the expectation that the poem will extol the virtues of faith. However, the subsequent lines reveal a subtle irony as the speaker suggests that while faith may be valuable, practical tools like microscopes are more prudent in emergencies. This irony challenges conventional beliefs about the superiority of faith over science. Additionally, the use of personification in describing faith as an "invention" and microscopes as "prudent" adds depth to the comparison between the two.

### Historical and Personal Context

Emily Dickinson, known for her unconventional and often enigmatic poetry, lived during a time when scientific advancements were rapidly changing society's understanding of the world. The mid-19th century was a period of significant progress in the fields of science and technology, with the microscope being a symbol of this advancement. Dickinson's personal context as a reclusive poet who grappled with themes of faith, doubt, and reason also informs the poem's exploration of these themes.

### Deep Reading

On a deeper level, "Faith" is a fine invention can be interpreted as a commentary on the dichotomy between faith and reason, belief and evidence. The speaker presents a nuanced perspective that acknowledges the value of faith while also recognizing the importance of empirical observation. By juxtaposing these two ways of understanding the world, Dickinson invites readers to consider the limitations and strengths of both approaches. The poem ultimately challenges the notion that faith and science are mutually exclusive, suggesting that they can coexist and complement each other in different contexts. Dickinson's subtle yet thought-provoking exploration of this theme makes "Faith" is a fine invention a rich and multi-layered poem.

## The Pied Piper of Hamelin: A Child's Story by Robert Browning

```
Hamelin town's in Brunswick,
By famous Hanover city;
The river Weser, deep and wide,
Washes its walls on either side;
A pleasanter spot you never spied;
But, when begins my ditty,
Almost five hundred years ago,
To see the townsfolk suffer so
From vermin, was a pity.

  Rats!
They fought the dogs and killed the cats,
And bit the babies in the cradles,
And ate the cheeses out of the vats,
And licked the soup from the cooks' own ladles,
Split open the kegs of salted sprats.
Made nests inside men's Sunday hats.
And even spoiled the women's chats
By drowning their speaking
With shrieking and squeaking
In fifty different sharps and flats.

At last the people in a body
To the Town Hall came flocking:
"'Tis clear," cried they, "our Mayor's a noddy;
And as for our Corporation, shocking
To think we buy gowns lined with ermine
For dolts that can't or won't determine
What's best to rid us of our vermin!
You hope, because you're old and obese,
To find in the furry civic robe ease!
Rouse up, sirs! give your brains a racking
To find the remedy we're lacking,
Or, sure as fate, we'll send you packing!"
At this the Mayor and Corporation
Quaked with a mighty consternation.

An hour they sat in council;
At length the Mayor broke silence:
"For a guilder I'd my ermine gown sell,
I wish I were a mile hence!
It's easy to bid one rack one's brain--
I'm sure my poor head aches again,
I've scratched it so, and all in vain.
Oh for a trap, a trap, a trap!"
Just as he said this, what should hap
At the chamber door but a gentle tap?
"Bless us," cried the Mayor, "what's that?"
(With the Corporation as he sat,
Looking little, though wondrous fat;
Nor brighter was his eye, nor moister
Than a too-long-opened oyster,
Save when at noon his paunch grew mutinous
For a plate of turtle, green and glutinous)
"Only a scraping of shoes on the mat?
Anything like the sound of a rat
Makes my heart go pit-a-pat!"

"Come in!"--the Mayor cried, looking bigger:
And in did come the strangest figure!
His queer long coat from heel to head
Was half of yellow and half of red,
And he himself was tall and thin,
With sharp blue eyes, each like a pin,
With light loose hair, yet swarthy skin,
No tuft on cheek, nor beard on chin,
But lips where smiles went out and in;
There was no guessing his kith and kin:
And nobody could enough admire
The tall man and his quaint attire.
Quoth one: "It's as my great grandsire,
Starting up at the Trump of Doom's tone,
Had walked his way from his painted tombstone!"

He advanced to the council-table:
And, "Please your honors," said he, "I'm able,
By means of a secret charm, to draw
All creatures living beneath the sun,
That creep or swim or fly or run,
After me so as you never saw!
And I chiefly use my charm
On creatures that do people harm,
The mole and toad and newt and viper;
And people call me the Pied Piper."
(And here they noticed round his neck
A scarf of red and yellow stripe,
To match with his coat of self-same cheque:
And at the scarf's end hung a pipe;
And his fingers, they noticed, were ever straying,
As if impatient to be playing
Upon this pipe, as low it dangled
Over his vesture so old-fangled.)
"Yet," said he, "poor piper as I am,
In Tartary I freed the Cham,
Last June, from his huge swarms of gnats;
I eased in Asia the Nizam
Of a monstrous brood of vampire-bats:
And as for what your brain bewilders,
If I can rid your town of rats
Will you give me a thousand guilders?"
"One? fifty thousand!"--was the exclamation
Of the astonished Mayor and Corporation.

Into the street the Piper stept,
Smiling first a little smile,
As if he knew what magic slept
In his quiet pipe the while:
Then, like a musical adept,
To blow the pipe his lips he wrinkled,
And green and blue his sharp eyes twinkled,
Like a candle-flame where salt is sprinkled;
And ere three shrill notes the pipe uttered,
You heard as if an army muttered:
And the muttering grew to a grumbling;
And the grumbling grew to a mighty rumbling;
And out of the houses the rats came tumbling.
Great rats, small rats, lean rats, brawny rats,
Brown rats, black rats, gray rats, tawny rats,
Grave old plodders, gay young friskers,
Fathers, mothers, uncles, cousins,
Cocking tails and pricking whiskers,
  Families by tens and dozens,
Brothers, sisters, husbands, wives--
Followed the Piper for their lives.
From street to street he piped advancing,
And step for step they followed dancing,
Until they came to the river Weser,
Wherein all plunged and perished!
--Save one, who, stout as Julius CÃ¦sar,
Swam across and lived to carry
(As he, the manuscript he cherished)
To Rat-land home his commentary:
Which was: "At the first shrill notes of the pipe,
I heard a sound as of scraping tripe,
And putting apples, wondrous ripe,
Into a cider press's gripe;
And a moving away of pickle-tub-boards,
And a leaving ajar of conserve-cupboards,
And a drawing the corks of train-oil-flasks,
And a breaking the hoops of butter-casks:
And it seemed as if a voice
(Sweeter far than by harp or by psaltery
Is breathed) called out, 'Oh, rats, rejoice!
The world is grown to one vast drysaltery!
So munch on, crunch on, take your nuncheon,
Breakfast, supper, dinner, luncheon!'
And just as a bulky sugar-puncheon,
Already staved, like a great sun shone
Glorious scarce an inch before me,
Just as methought it said, 'Come, bore me!'
--I found the Weser rolling o'er me."

You should have heard the Hamelin people
Ringing the bells till they rocked the steeple.
"Go," cried the Mayor, "and get long poles,
Poke out the nests and block up the holes!
Consult with carpenters and builders,
And leave in our town, not even a trace
Of the rats!"--when suddenly, up the face
Of the Piper perked in the market-place,
With a, "First, if you please, my thousand guilders!"

A thousand guilders! The Mayor looked blue;
So did the Corporation, too.
For council dinners made rare havoc
With Claret, Moselle, Vin-de-Grave, Hock;
And half the money would replenish
Their cellar's biggest butt with Rhenish.
To pay this sum to a wandering fellow
With a gypsy coat of red and yellow!
"Beside," quoth the Mayor, with a knowing wink,
"Our business was done at the river's brink;
We saw with our eyes the vermin sink,
And what's dead can't come to life, I think.
So, friend, we're not the folks to shrink
From the duty of giving you something for drink,
And a matter of money to put in your poke;
But as for the guilders, what we spoke
Of them, as you very well know, was in joke.
Beside, our losses have made us thrifty.
A thousand guilders! Come, take fifty!"

The Piper's face fell, and he cried,
"No trifling! I can't wait! Beside,
I've promised to visit by dinner-time
Bagdat, and accept the prime
Of the Head-Cook's pottage, all he's rich in,
For having left, in the Caliph's kitchen,
Of a nest of scorpions no survivor:
With him I proved no bargain-driver,
With you, don't think I'll bate a stiver!
And folks who put me in a passion
May find me pipe after another fashion."

"How?" cried the Mayor, "d'ye think I brook
Being worse treated than a cook?
Insulted by a lazy ribald
With idle pipe and vesture piebald?
You threaten us, fellow? Do your worst!
Blow your pipe there till you burst!"

Once more he stept into the street,
  And to his lips again
Laid his long pipe of smooth straight cane;
  And ere he blew three notes (such sweet,
Soft notes as yet musician's cunning
  Never gave the enraptured air)
There was a rustling that seemed like a bustling
Of merry crowds justling at pitching and hustling;
Small feet were pattering, wooden shoes clattering,
Little hands clapping, and little tongues chattering,
And, like fowls in a farm-yard, when barley is scattering,
Out came the children running.
All the little boys and girls.
With rosy cheeks and flaxen curls,
And sparkling eyes and teeth like pearls,
Tripping and skipping, ran merrily after
The wonderful music with shouting and laughter.

The Mayor was dumb, and the Council stood
As if they were changed into blocks of wood.
Unable to move a step, or cry
To the children merrily skipping by,
--Could only follow with the eye
That joyous crowd at the piper's back.
But how the Mayor was on the rack,
And the wretched Council's bosom beat,
As the Piper turned from the High Street
To where the Weser rolled its waters,
Right in the way of their sons and daughters!
However, he turned from South to West,
And to Koppelberg Hill his steps addressed,
And after him the children pressed:
Great was the joy in every breast.
"He never can cross that mighty top!
He's forced to let the piping drop,
And we shall see our children stop."
When lo, as they reached the mountain-side,
A wondrous portal opened wide,
As if a cavern were suddenly hollowed;
And the Piper advanced, and the children followed,
And when all were in, to the very last,
The door in the mountain-side shut fast.
Did I say all? No! One was lame,
And could not dance the whole of the way;
And in after years, if you would blame
His sadness, he was used to say,--
"It's dull in our town since my playmates left!
I can't forget that I'm bereft
Of all the pleasant sights they see,
Which the Piper also promised me.
For he led us, he said, to a joyous land.
Joining the town, and just at hand,
Where waters gushed and fruit-trees grew,
And flowers put forth a fairer hue,
And everything was strange and new:
The sparrows were brighter than peacocks here,
And their dogs outran our fallow deer.
And honey-bees had lost their stings,
And horses were born with eagles' wings;
And just as I became assured,
My lame foot would be speedily cured,
The music stopped and I stood still,
And found myself outside the hill,
Left alone against my will,
To go now limping as before.
And never hear of that country more!"

Alas, alas for Hamelin!
  There came into many a burgher's pate
  A text which says that Heaven's gate
  Opes to the rich at as easy a rate
As the needle's eye takes a camel in!
The Mayor sent East, West, North, and South,
To offer the Piper, by word of mouth,
  Wherever it was men's lot to find him,
Silver and gold to his heart's content,
If he'd only return the way he went,
  And bring the children behind him.
But when they saw 'twas a lost endeavor,
And Piper and dancers were gone forever,
They made a decree that lawyers never
  Should think their records dated duly
If, after the day of the month and year,
These words did not as well appear,
  "And so long after what happened here
  On the twenty-second of July,
Thirteen hundred and seventy-six;"
And the better in memory to fix
The place of the children's last retreat,
They called it the Pied Piper's Street--
Where any one playing on pipe or tabor
Was sure for the future to lose his labour.
Nor suffered they hostelry or tavern
  To shock with mirth a street so solemn;
But opposite the place of the cavern
  They wrote the story on a column,
And on the great church window painted
The same, to make the world acquainted
How their children were stolen away.
And there it stands to this very day.
And I must not omit to say
That in Transylvania there's a tribe
Of alien people who ascribe
The outlandish ways and dress
On which their neighbours lay such stress,
To their fathers and mothers having risen
Out of some subterraneous prison
Into which they were trepanned
Long time ago in a mighty band
Out of Hamelin town in Brunswick land,
But how or why, they don't understand.

So, Willy, let me and you be wipers
Of scores out with all men--especially pipers!
And, whether they pipe us free from rats or from mice,
If we've promised them aught, let us keep our promise!
```

## Sonnet 30 - I see thine image through my tears to-night by Elizabeth Barrett Browning

```
I see thine image through my tears to-night,
And yet to-day I saw thee smiling. How
Refer the cause?âBeloved, is it thou
Or I, who makes me sad? The acolyte
Amid the chanted joy and thankful rite
May so fall flat, with pale insensate brow,
On the altar-stair. I hear thy voice and vow,
Perplexed, uncertain, since thou art out of sight,
As he, in his swooning ears, the choir's Amen.
Beloved, dost thou love? or did I see all
The glory as I dreamed, and fainted when
Too vehement light dilated my ideal,
For my soul's eyes? Will that light come again,
As now these tears comeâfalling hot and real?
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

In Sonnet 30 by Elizabeth Barrett Browning, the poem follows the traditional form of a Shakespearean sonnet, consisting of 14 lines written in iambic pentameter. The rhyme scheme is ABABCDCDEFEFGG.

Browning's choice of this form emphasizes the emotional depth and complexity of the speaker's feelings towards the beloved.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem revolves around the speaker's intense emotions and inner turmoil caused by their perception of the beloved. The imagery of tears, smiles, altars, and swooning choir members conveys the speaker's confusion and longing. The contrast between seeing the beloved smiling during the day and then feeling sadness at night highlights the speaker's emotional volatility and the fleeting nature of happiness. The use of religious imagery, such as the acolyte on the altar-stair and the choir's Amen, adds a sense of reverence and devotion to the speaker's feelings.

### Literary Devices

Browning employs several literary devices in the poem to enhance its emotional impact. The use of rhetorical questions, such as "Refer the cause?âBeloved, is it thou / Or I, who makes me sad?" invites the reader to ponder the nature of love and perception. The simile "may so fall flat, with pale insensate brow, / On the altar-stair" compares the speaker's emotional state to that of a worshipper fainting in the presence of divinity. The metaphor of "the choir's Amen" symbolizes the speaker's longing for affirmation and closure in their relationship with the beloved.

### Historical and Personal Context

Elizabeth Barrett Browning was a prominent Victorian poet known for her exploration of love, faith, and social issues. Sonnet 30 reflects Browning's own experiences of love and loss, as well as her deep engagement with themes of spirituality and devotion.

### Deep Reading

At its core, Sonnet 30 delves into the complexities of love, perception, and the search for meaning in human relationships. The speaker's oscillation between joy and sorrow mirrors the fragility of emotions and the ephemeral nature of happiness. The final lines, "Will that light come again, / As now these tears comeâfalling hot and real?" encapsulate the speaker's yearning for a return to the blissful state of love, despite the current pain. Browning's exploration of the dualities of love and longing resonates with readers, inviting them to reflect on their own experiences of love and loss.
