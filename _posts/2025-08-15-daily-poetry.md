Speak up, Ike, an' 'spress yo'se'f!

### Literary Devices
Dunbar employs several literary devices in the poem to enhance its meaning and impact. One such device is repetition, particularly in the refrain "Speak up, Ike, an' 'spress yo'se'f," which emphasizes the speaker's desire for Ike to communicate openly. The use of dialect, such as "hyeah" for here and "cain't" for can't, adds authenticity to the dialogue and helps establish the characters' identities.

### Historical and Personal Context

## Lines Written In Early Spring by William Wordsworth

```
I heard a thousand blended notes,
While in a grove I sate reclined,
In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts
Bring sad thoughts to the mind.

To her fair works did Nature link
The human soul that through me ran;
And much it grieved my heart to think
What man has made of man.

Through primrose tufts, in that green bower,
The periwinkle trailed its wreaths;
And 'tis my faith that every flower
Enjoys the air it breathes.

The birds around me hopped and played,
Their thoughts I cannot measure:--
But the least motion which they made
It seemed a thrill of pleasure.

The budding twigs spread out their fan,
To catch the breezy air;
And I must think, do all I can,
That there was pleasure there.

If this belief from heaven be sent,
If such be Nature's holy plan,
Have I not reason to lament
What man has made of man?
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

These images evoke a sense of peace and harmony, highlighting the purity and vitality of the natural world.

### Literary Devices

Wordsworth employs several literary devices throughout the poem to enhance its themes and imagery. One prominent device is personification, as he attributes human emotions and intentions to nature, such as flowers "enjoying the air they breathe" and twigs spreading out their fan to "catch the breezy air." This technique humanizes nature and underscores the deep connection between the speaker and the natural world. Additionally, the use of alliteration in phrases like "pleasant thoughts bring sad thoughts" and "periwinkle trailed" adds a musical quality to the poem, further enhancing its lyrical beauty.

### Historical and Personal Context

Ultimately, the poem prompts readers to reflect on their own connection to the natural world and the importance of preserving its beauty and integrity in the face of human folly.

## The Patriot: An Old Story by Robert Browning

```
It was roses, roses, all the way,
  With myrtle mixed in my path like mad;
The house-roofs seemed to heave and sway,
  The church-spires flamed, such flags they had,
A year ago on this very day.

The air broke into a mist with bells,
  The old walls rocked with the crowd and cries.
Had I said, "Good folk, mere noise repels--
  But give me your sun from yonder skies!"
They had answered "And afterward, what else?"

Alack, it was I who leaped at the sun
  To give it my loving friends to keep!
Naught man could do, have I left undone:
  And you see my harvest, what I reap
This very day, now a year is run.

There's nobody on the house-tops now--
  Just a palsied few at the windows set;
For the best of the sight is, all allow,
  At the Shambles' Gate--or, better yet,
By the very scaffold's foot, I trow.

I go in the rain, and, more than needs,
  A rope cuts both my wrists behind;
And I think, by the feel, my forehead bleeds,
  For they fling, whoever has a mind,
Stones at me for my year's misdeeds.

Thus I entered, and thus I go!
  In triumphs, people have dropped down dead,
"Paid by the world, what dost thou owe
  Me? "--God might question; now instead,
'Tis God shall repay: I am safer so.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "The Patriot: An Old Story" by Robert Browning is written in free verse, allowing the poet to convey a sense of raw emotion and intensity. The lack of a strict rhyme scheme or meter adds to the chaotic and dramatic nature of the narrative. However, Browning's use of repetition, particularly with the repeated lines "It was roses, roses, all the way" and "A year ago on this very day," creates a sense of rhythm and emphasis, drawing attention to key moments in the speaker's story. This repetition also serves to highlight the passage of time and the cyclical nature of the protagonist's fate.

### Themes and Imagery

The central themes of the poem revolve around sacrifice, betrayal, and the consequences of idealism. The speaker, a patriot, describes his journey from being hailed as a hero to facing public condemnation and punishment. The imagery in the poem is vivid and symbolic, with the abundance of roses and myrtle at the beginning representing honor and glory, which eventually give way to a bleak and desolate scene of rain, blood, and stones. The contrast between the initial celebration and the final humiliation underscores the fleeting nature of fame and the harsh realities of political or social movements.

### Literary Devices

Browning employs several literary devices to enhance the poem's impact. One notable device is juxtaposition, as seen in the contrast between the initial jubilant scenes of celebration and the bleak, tragic ending. The use of personification is evident in lines like "The house-roofs seemed to heave and sway," giving the setting a sense of life and movement. Browning also utilizes alliteration, assonance, and imagery to create a sensory experience for the reader, such as the sound of bells breaking the air and the visual of the protagonist being pelted with stones.

### Historical and Personal Context

Written during the Victorian era, Browning's poem reflects the political turmoil and social upheaval of the time. The protagonist's fall from grace echoes the experiences of many real-life figures who were once revered but later condemned by society. Browning himself was known for his exploration of complex moral and ethical themes, and "The Patriot" can be seen as a commentary on the dangers of blind idealism and the harsh realities of public opinion.

### Deep Reading

At its core, "The Patriot: An Old Story" delves into the complexities of human nature and the consequences of unwavering loyalty to a cause. The protagonist's journey serves as a cautionary tale, highlighting the fickle nature of public adoration and the sacrifices made in the name of perceived righteousness. The poem challenges the reader to question the true cost of standing up for one's beliefs and the ultimate price one may have to pay for their convictions. By exploring themes of betrayal, disillusionment, and redemption, Browning invites us to reflect on the fragility of heroism and the inherent flaws of human society.
