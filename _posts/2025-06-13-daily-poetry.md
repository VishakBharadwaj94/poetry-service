## Incident of the French Camp by Robert Browning

```
You know, we French stormed Ratisbon:
  A mile or so away
On a little mound, Napoleon
  Stood on our storming-day;
With neck out-thrust, you fancy how,
  Legs wide, arms locked behind,
As if to balance the prone brow
  Oppressive with its mind.

Just as perhaps he mused "My plans
  That soar, to earth may fall,
Let once my army-leader Lannes
  Waver at yonder wall"--
Out 'twixt the battery-smokes there flew
  A rider, bound on bound
Full-galloping; nor bridle drew
  Until he reached the mound,

Then off there flung in smiling joy,
  And held himself erect
By just his horse's mane, a boy:
  You hardly could suspect--
(So tight he kept his lips compressed.
  Scarce any blood came through)
You looked twice ere you saw his breast
  Was all but shot in two.

"Well," cried he, "Emperor, by God's grace
  We've got you Ratisbon!
The Marshal's in the market-place,
  And you'll be there anon
To see your flag-bird flap his vans
  Where I, to heart's desire,
Perched him!" The chief's eye flashed; his plans
  Soared up again like fire.

The chief's eye flashed; but presently
  Softened itself, as sheathes
A film the mother-eagle's eye
  When her bruised eaglet breathes.
"You're wounded!" "Nay," the soldier's pride
  Touched to the quick, he said:
"I'm killed, Sire!" And his chief beside,
  Smiling, the boy fell dead.
```

### Themes and Imagery

The overarching themes in this poem include heroism, sacrifice, and the brutality of war. The imagery used by Browning is vivid and evocative, painting a picture of a battlefield where the young soldier's act of bravery and sacrifice is juxtaposed against the backdrop of Napoleon's grandeur and the harsh reality of war. The image of Napoleon standing with "neck out-thrust" and "legs wide" conveys his commanding presence, while the description of the soldier riding full gallop with a severe chest wound highlights the brutal consequences of battle.

### Literary Devices

Browning employs various literary devices to enhance the poem's impact. One notable device is imagery, as seen in lines like "As if to balance the prone brow" and "The chief's eye flashed; his plans / Soared up again like fire." These images create a vivid picture in the reader's mind and evoke strong emotions. Additionally, Browning uses personification when describing Napoleon's eye softening "like a film the mother-eagle's eye." This comparison adds depth to Napoleon's character and highlights his humanity in the face of tragedy.

The final lines, where the soldier insists he is "killed" rather than wounded, reveal the depth of his commitment and the ultimate sacrifice he makes for his leader. This juxtaposition of power and vulnerability, heroism and tragedy, invites readers to reflect on the human experience within the context of war and leadership.

## 1914 V: The Soldier by Rupert Brooke

```
If I should die, think only this of me:
That there's some corner of a foreign field
That is for ever England. There shall be
In that rich earth a richer dust concealed;
A dust whom England bore, shaped, made aware,
Gave, once, her flowers to love, her ways to roam,
A body of England's, breathing English air,
Washed by the rivers, blest by suns of home.

And think, this heart, all evil shed away,
A pulse in the eternal mind, no less
Gives somewhere back the thoughts by England given;
Her sights and sounds; dreams happy as her day;
And laughter, learnt of friends; and gentleness,
In hearts at peace, under an English heaven.
```
