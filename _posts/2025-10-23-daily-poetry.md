## Sympathy by Paul Laurence Dunbar

```
I know what the caged bird feels, alas!
When the sun is bright on the upland slopes;
When the wind stirs soft through the springing grass,
And the river flows like a stream of glass;
When the first bird sings and the first bud opes,
And the faint perfume from its chalice steals--
I know what the caged bird feels!

I know why the caged bird beats his wing
Till its blood is red on the cruel bars;
For he must fly back to his perch and cling
When he fain would be on the bough a-swing;
And a pain still throbs in the old, old scars
And they pulse again with a keener sting--
I know why he beats his wing!

I know why the caged bird sings, ah me,
When his wing is bruised and his bosom sore,--
When he beats his bars and he would be free;
It is not a carol of joy or glee,
But a prayer that he sends from his heart's deep core,
But a plea, that upward to Heaven he flings--
I know why the caged bird sings!
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "Sympathy" by Paul Laurence Dunbar consists of three stanzas, each with seven lines. The rhyme scheme is ABABCDC, with the second and sixth lines rhyming in each stanza. This consistent rhyme scheme adds a sense of unity to the poem and helps to drive home the central message.

The meter of the poem is primarily iambic tetrameter, with four stressed and four unstressed syllables per line. This steady rhythm reflects the trapped and repetitive nature of the caged bird's existence, emphasizing its struggle and longing for freedom. The use of enjambment, where the sense of a sentence runs over from one line to the next, creates a flowing and continuous feel to the poem, mirroring the bird's desire to break free from its confines.

### Themes and Imagery

One of the central themes of the poem is captivity and the longing for freedom. Dunbar uses vivid imagery to convey the caged bird's experience, contrasting the beauty of the outside world with the bird's confinement. The bright sun, soft wind, flowing river, and singing bird represent the freedom and joy that the caged bird desires but cannot attain.

The imagery of the caged bird beating its wings against the bars, causing its blood to turn red, evokes a sense of pain and struggle. This imagery highlights the physical and emotional toll of being trapped and unable to fulfill one's natural instincts and desires. The repetition of the phrase "I know" emphasizes the speaker's empathy and understanding of the bird's suffering.

### Literary Devices

Dunbar employs several literary devices to enhance the poem's impact. The most prominent device is symbolism, with the caged bird serving as a metaphor for any creature or individual trapped in a restrictive or oppressive situation. The bird's actions of beating its wings and singing represent its resistance and longing for freedom, while the cage symbolizes confinement and limitation.

The use of alliteration in phrases like "faint perfume" and "old, old scars" creates a musical quality in the poem and draws attention to key images and emotions. The repetition of the phrase "I know" throughout the poem emphasizes the speaker's understanding and empathy for the caged bird's plight, reinforcing the theme of sympathy.

### Historical and Personal Context

Paul Laurence Dunbar, an African American poet who lived during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, often explored themes of race, identity, and oppression in his work. "Sympathy" can be interpreted as a reflection of Dunbar's own experiences of racial discrimination and the limitations placed on African Americans during his lifetime. The caged bird may symbolize the struggle for freedom and equality faced by African Americans in a society that sought to confine and control them.

Dunbar's use of the caged bird as a metaphor for oppression can also be applied more broadly to any individual or group facing systemic injustices and barriers to their freedom and autonomy. The poem's message of empathy and understanding resonates with anyone who has felt trapped or constrained by external forces beyond their control.

### Deep Reading

On a deeper level, "Sympathy" can be seen as a powerful commentary on the human condition and the universal desire for freedom and self-determination. The caged bird's struggle and suffering serve as a poignant reminder of the consequences of oppression and the resilience of the human spirit in the face of adversity.

The poem's title, "Sympathy," suggests a call for compassion and understanding towards those who are marginalized or oppressed. By drawing parallels between the caged bird and individuals who are denied their rights and freedoms, Dunbar invites readers to empathize with the struggles of others and to recognize the inherent dignity and worth of every living being.

In conclusion, "Sympathy" is a timeless and poignant poem that speaks to the universal longing for freedom and the importance of empathy and compassion in the face of suffering. Through its evocative imagery, powerful themes, and skillful use of literary devices, the poem continues to resonate with readers and inspire reflection on the nature of captivity and the pursuit of liberation.

## Funeral Of Youth, The: Threnody by Rupert Brooke

```
The day that YOUTH had died,
There came to his grave-side,
In decent mourning, from the country's ends,
Those scatter'd friends
Who had lived the boon companions of his prime,
And laughed with him and sung with him and wasted,
In feast and wine and many-crown'd carouse,
The days and nights and dawnings of the time
When YOUTH kept open house,
Nor left untasted
Aught of his high emprise and ventures dear,
No quest of his unshar'd --
All these, with loitering feet and sad head bar'd,
Followed their old friend's bier.
FOLLY went first,
With muffled bells and coxcomb still revers'd;
And after trod the bearers, hat in hand --
LAUGHTER, most hoarse, and Captain PRIDE with tanned
And martial face all grim, and fussy JOY,
Who had to catch a train, and LUST, poor, snivelling boy;
These bore the dear departed.
Behind them, broken-hearted,
Came GRIEF, so noisy a widow, that all said,
"Had he but wed
Her elder sister SORROW, in her stead!"
And by her, trying to soothe her all the time,
The fatherless children, COLOUR, TUNE, and RHYME
(The sweet lad RHYME), ran all-uncomprehending.
Then, at the way's sad ending,
Round the raw grave they stay'd. Old WISDOM read,
In mumbling tone, the Service for the Dead.
There stood ROMANCE,
The furrowing tears had mark'd her rouged cheek;
Poor old CONCEIT, his wonder unassuaged;
Dead INNOCENCY's daughter, IGNORANCE;
And shabby, ill-dress'd GENEROSITY;
And ARGUMENT, too full of woe to speak;
PASSION, grown portly, something middle-aged;
And FRIENDSHIP -- not a minute older, she;
IMPATIENCE, ever taking out his watch;
FAITH, who was deaf, and had to lean, to catch
Old WISDOM's endless drone.
BEAUTY was there,
Pale in her black; dry-eyed; she stood alone.
Poor maz'd IMAGINATION; FANCY wild;
ARDOUR, the sunlight on his greying hair;
CONTENTMENT, who had known YOUTH as a child
And never seen him since. And SPRING came too,
Dancing over the tombs, and brought him flowers --
She did not stay for long.
And TRUTH, and GRACE, and all the merry crew,
The laughing WINDS and RIVERS, and lithe HOURS;
And HOPE, the dewy-eyed; and sorrowing SONG; --
Yes, with much woe and mourning general,
At dead YOUTH's funeral,
Even these were met once more together, all,
Who erst the fair and living YOUTH did know;
All, except only LOVE. LOVE had died long ago.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

Rupert Brooke's poem "Funeral Of Youth, The: Threnody" is written in free verse, with no strict rhyme scheme or meter. The lack of a formal structure mirrors the chaotic and mournful nature of the funeral procession described in the poem. The poem is divided into stanzas, each focusing on different characters who attend the funeral of Youth. The lack of a consistent rhyme scheme allows for a natural flow of the narrative, highlighting the diverse group of characters who come to pay their respects.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem is the passage of time and the inevitability of growing older. Youth, personified as a beloved friend, has died, and the procession of mourners represents different aspects of life that are affected by this loss. The imagery in the poem is vivid and varied, with each character symbolizing a different emotion or quality related to Youth. The funeral procession is a metaphor for the end of innocence and the acceptance of mortality, as seen in the presence of Grief, Wisdom, and other personified emotions and traits.

### Literary Devices

Brooke employs personification throughout the poem, giving human qualities to abstract concepts such as Folly, Laughter, and Grief. This technique adds depth to the characters and enhances the emotional impact of the poem. The use of alliteration in phrases like "feast and wine and many-crown'd carouse" and "laughing WINDS and RIVERS" creates a musical quality that enhances the imagery and themes of the poem. The repetition of the word "And" at the beginning of many lines emphasizes the collective mourning and unity of the characters at the funeral.

### Historical and Personal Context

Written during the early 20th century, Rupert Brooke's poem reflects the disillusionment and loss of innocence that many experienced during World War I. The funeral procession can be seen as a metaphor for the death of a generation of young men who went off to war and never returned. Brooke himself served as a soldier in the war and died at a young age, adding a personal resonance to the themes of mortality and loss in the poem.

### Deep Reading

At a deeper level, "Funeral Of Youth, The: Threnody" can be interpreted as a meditation on the passage of time and the fleeting nature of life. The procession of characters represents different aspects of human experience, from Joy and Passion to Wisdom and Sorrow. The absence of Love at the funeral suggests that love, like youth, is also subject to the ravages of time and mortality. The poem invites readers to reflect on their own mortality and the inevitable changes that come with growing older. Through its rich imagery and poignant themes, Brooke's poem captures the universal experience of loss and the bittersweet nostalgia for youth and innocence.

## The Strayed Reveller by Matthew Arnold

```
1 Faster, faster,
2 O Circe, Goddess,
3 Let the wild, thronging train
4 The bright procession
5 Of eddying forms,
6 Sweep through my soul!

7 Thou standest, smiling
8 Down on me! thy right arm,
9 Lean'd up against the column there,
10 Props thy soft cheek;
11 Thy left holds, hanging loosely,
12 The deep cup, ivy-cinctured,
13 I held but now.

14 Is it, then, evening
15 So soon? I see, the night-dews,
16 Cluster'd in thick beads, dim
17 The agate brooch-stones
18 On thy white shoulder;
19 The cool night-wind, too,
20 Blows through the portico,
21 Stirs thy hair, Goddess,
22 Waves thy white robe!

Circe.

23 Whence art thou, sleeper?

The Youth.

24 When the white dawn first
25 Through the rough fir-planks
26 Of my hut, by the chestnuts,
27 Up at the valley-head,
28 Came breaking, Goddess!
29 I sprang up, I threw round me
30 My dappled fawn-skin;
31 Passing out, from the wet turf,
32 Where they lay, by the hut door,
33 I snatch'd up my vine-crown, my fir-staff,
34 All drench'd in dew-
35 Came swift down to join
36 The rout early gather'd
37 In the town, round the temple,
38 Iacchus' white fane
39 On yonder hill.

40 Quick I pass'd, following
41 The wood-cutters' cart-track
42 Down the dark valley;-I saw
43 On my left, through the beeches,
44 Thy palace, Goddess,
45 Smokeless, empty!
46 Trembling, I enter'd; beheld
47 The court all silent,
48 The lions sleeping,
49 On the altar this bowl.
50 I drank, Goddess!
51 And sank down here, sleeping,
52 On the steps of thy portico.

Circe.

53 Foolish boy! Why tremblest thou?
54 Thou lovest it, then, my wine?
55 Wouldst more of it? See, how glows,
56 Through the delicate, flush'd marble,
57 The red, creaming liquor,
58 Strown with dark seeds!
59 Drink, thee! I chide thee not,
60 Deny thee not my bowl.
61 Come, stretch forth thy hand, thee-so!
62 Drink-drink again!

The Youth.

63 Thanks, gracious one!
64 Ah, the sweet fumes again!
65 More soft, ah me,
66 More subtle-winding
67 Than Pan's flute-music!
68 Faint-faint! Ah me,
69 Again the sweet sleep!

Circe.

70 Hist! Thou-within there!
71 Come forth, Ulysses!
72 Art tired with hunting?
73 While we range the woodland,
74 See what the day brings.

Ulysses.

75 Ever new magic!
76 Hast thou then lured hither,
77 Wonderful Goddess, by thy art,
78 The young, languid-eyed Ampelus,
79 Iacchus' darling-
80 Or some youth beloved of Pan,
81 Of Pan and the Nymphs?
82 That he sits, bending downward
83 His white, delicate neck
84 To the ivy-wreathed marge
85 Of thy cup; the bright, glancing vine-leaves
86 That crown his hair,
87 Falling forward, mingling
88 With the dark ivy-plants--
89 His fawn-skin, half untied,
90 Smear'd with red wine-stains? Who is he,
91 That he sits, overweigh'd
92 By fumes of wine and sleep,
93 So late, in thy portico?
94 What youth, Goddess,-what guest
95 Of Gods or mortals?

Circe.

96 Hist! he wakes!
97 I lured him not hither, Ulysses.
98 Nay, ask him!

The Youth.

99 Who speaks' Ah, who comes forth
100 To thy side, Goddess, from within?
101 How shall I name him?
102 This spare, dark-featured,
103 Quick-eyed stranger?
104 Ah, and I see too
105 His sailor's bonnet,
106 His short coat, travel-tarnish'd,
107 With one arm bare!--
108 Art thou not he, whom fame
109 This long time rumours
110 The favour'd guest of Circe, brought by the waves?
111 Art thou he, stranger?
112 The wise Ulysses,
113 Laertes' son?

Ulysses.

114 I am Ulysses.
115 And thou, too, sleeper?
116 Thy voice is sweet.
117 It may be thou hast follow'd
118 Through the islands some divine bard,
119 By age taught many things,
120 Age and the Muses;
121 And heard him delighting
122 The chiefs and people
123 In the banquet, and learn'd his songs.
124 Of Gods and Heroes,
125 Of war and arts,
126 And peopled cities,
127 Inland, or built
128 By the gray sea.-If so, then hail!
129 I honour and welcome thee.

The Youth.

130 The Gods are happy.
131 They turn on all sides
132 Their shining eyes,
133 And see below them
134 The earth and men.

135 They see Tiresias
136 Sitting, staff in hand,
137 On the warm, grassy
138 Asopus bank,
139 His robe drawn over
140 His old sightless head,
141 Revolving inly
142 The doom of Thebes.

143 They see the Centaurs
144 In the upper glens
145 Of Pelion, in the streams,
146 Where red-berried ashes fringe
147 The clear-brown shallow pools,
148 With streaming flanks, and heads
149 Rear'd proudly, snuffing
150 The mountain wind.

151 They see the Indian
152 Drifting, knife in hand,
153 His frail boat moor'd to
154 A floating isle thick-matted
155 With large-leaved, low-creeping melon-plants
156 And the dark cucumber.

157 He reaps, and stows them,
158 Drifting--drifting;--round him,
159 Round his green harvest-plot,
160 Flow the cool lake-waves,
161 The mountains ring them.

162 They see the Scythian
163 On the wide stepp, unharnessing
164 His wheel'd house at noon.
165 He tethers his beast down, and makes his meal--
166 Mares' milk, and bread
167 Baked on the embers;--all around
168 The boundless, waving grass-plains stretch, thick-starr'd
169 With saffron and the yellow hollyhock
170 And flag-leaved iris-flowers.
171 Sitting in his cart
172 He makes his meal; before him, for long miles,
173 Alive with bright green lizards,
174 And the springing bustard-fowl,
175 The track, a straight black line,
176 Furrows the rich soil; here and there
177 Cluster of lonely mounds
178 Topp'd with rough-hewn,
179 Gray, rain-blear'd statues, overpeer
180 The sunny waste.

181 They see the ferry
182 On the broad, clay-laden
183 Lone Chorasmian stream;--thereon,
184 With snort and strain,
185 Two horses, strongly swimming, tow
186 The ferry-boat, with woven ropes
187 To either bow
188 Firm harness'd by the mane; a chief
189 With shout and shaken spear,
190 Stands at the prow, and guides them; but astern
191 The cowering merchants, in long robes,
192 Sit pale beside their wealth
193 Of silk-bales and of balsam-drops,
194 Of gold and ivory,
195 Of turquoise-earth and amethyst,
196 Jasper and chalcedony,
197 And milk-barred onyx-stones.
198 The loaded boat swings groaning
199 In the yellow eddies;
200 The Gods behold him.

201 They see the Heroes
202 Sitting in the dark ship
203 On the foamless, long-heaving
204 Violet sea.
205 At sunset nearing
206 The Happy Islands.

207 These things, Ulysses,
208 The wise bards, also
209 Behold and sing.
210 But oh, what labour!
211 O prince, what pain!
212 They too can see
213 Tiresias;--but the Gods,
214 Who give them vision,
215 Added this law:
216 That they should bear too
217 His groping blindness,
218 His dark foreboding,
219 His scorn'd white hairs;
220 Bear Hera's anger
221 Through a life lengthen'd
222 To seven ages.

223 They see the Centaurs
224 On Pelion:--then they feel,
225 They too, the maddening wine
226 Swell their large veins to bursting; in wild pain
227 They feel the biting spears
228 Of the grim Lapithж, and Theseus, drive,
229 Drive crashing through their bones; they feel
230 High on a jutting rock in the red stream
231 Alcmena's dreadful son
232 Ply his bow;--such a price
233 The Gods exact for song:
234 To become what we sing.

235 They see the Indian
236 On his mountain lake; but squalls
237 Make their skiff reel, and worms
238 In the unkind spring have gnawn
239 Their melon-harvest to the heart.--They see
240 The Scythian: but long frosts
241 Parch them in winter-time on the bare stepp,
242 Till they too fade like grass; they crawl
243 Like shadows forth in spring.

244 They see the merchants
245 On the Oxus stream;--but care
246 Must visit first them too, and make them pale.
247 Whether, through whirling sand,
248 A cloud of desert robber-horse have burst
249 Upon their caravan; or greedy kings,
250 In the wall'd cities the way passes through,
251 Crush'd them with tolls; or fever-airs,
252 On some great river's marge,
253 Mown them down, far from home.

254 They see the Heroes
255 Near harbour;--but they share
256 Their lives, and former violent toil in Thebes,
257 Seven-gated Thebes, or Troy;
258 Or where the echoing oars
259 Of Argo first
260 Startled the unknown sea.

261 The old Silenus
262 Came, lolling in the sunshine,
263 From the dewy forest-coverts,
264 This way at noon.
265 Sitting by me, while his Fauns
266 Down at the water-side
267 Sprinkled and smoothed
268 His drooping garland,
269 He told me these things.

270 But I, Ulysses,
271 Sitting on the warm steps,
272 Looking over the valley,
273 All day long, have seen,
274 Without pain, without labour,
275 Sometimes a wild-hair'd Mжnad--
276 Sometimes a Faun with torches--
277 And sometimes, for a moment,
278 Passing through the dark stems
279 Flowing-robed, the beloved,
280 The desired, the divine,
281 Beloved Iacchus.

282 Ah, cool night-wind, tremulous stars!
283 Ah, glimmering water,
284 Fitful earth-murmur,
285 Dreaming woods!
286 Ah, golden-haired, strangely smiling Goddess,
287 And thou, proved, much enduring,
288 Wave-toss'd Wanderer!
289 Who can stand still?
290 Ye fade, ye swim, ye waver before me--
291 The cup again!

292 Faster, faster,
293 O Circe, Goddess.
294 Let the wild, thronging train,
295 The bright procession
296 Of eddying forms,
297 Sweep through my soul!
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme
The poem "The Strayed Reveller" by Matthew Arnold is written in free verse, meaning it does not adhere to a specific meter or rhyme scheme. The lack of a consistent structure adds to the dreamlike quality of the poem and allows the imagery and themes to take center stage without the constraints of a traditional form. The poem is divided into two main speakers - Circe and the Youth, with Ulysses also making an appearance towards the end. This structure creates a dynamic dialogue between the characters and adds depth to the exploration of the themes presented in the poem.

### Themes and Imagery
The poem explores themes of temptation, escapism, the pursuit of pleasure, and the consequences of indulgence. The imagery used throughout the poem is rich and vivid, painting a picture of a fantastical world where gods and mortals interact. The references to Greek mythology, such as Circe and Ulysses, add a layer of complexity to the themes of the poem, as they symbolize different aspects of human nature and desire. The lush descriptions of nature, the night sky, and the various characters create a sensory experience for the reader, drawing them into the dreamlike world of the poem.

### Literary Devices
Arnold uses a variety of literary devices to enhance the poetic experience of the reader. Imagery is a prominent device in the poem, with descriptions of nature, the characters, and their actions vividly portrayed through words. Personification is also used, as seen in lines like "The cool night-wind, too, Blows through the portico, Stirs thy hair, Goddess," where the wind is given human-like qualities. Alliteration is present in lines like "Faint-faint! Ah me, Again the sweet sleep!" adding a musical quality to the poem. The dialogue between the characters serves as a form of dramatic irony, as the reader is privy to information that the characters themselves may not fully grasp.

### Historical and Personal Context
Matthew Arnold was a Victorian poet and critic known for his exploration of complex themes and his engagement with classical literature. "The Strayed Reveller" reflects Arnold's interest in Greek mythology and his examination of the human experience. The poem can be seen as a reflection of the tensions between indulgence and responsibility, pleasure and duty, that were prevalent in Victorian society. Arnold's own struggles with the demands of his time, both as a poet and a critic, may have influenced the themes of the poem, as he grappled with the conflicting desires for artistic freedom and societal expectations.

### Deep Reading
At its core, "The Strayed Reveller" delves into the timeless struggle between the pursuit of pleasure and the consequences of indulgence. The character of the Youth represents the allure of hedonism and escapism, as he is drawn into Circe's world of wine and dreams. Circe, on the other hand, embodies the seductive power of temptation and the dangers of losing oneself in excess. Ulysses serves as a voice of reason and experience, offering a counterbalance to the Youth's naivety. The poem ultimately serves as a cautionary tale, warning against the dangers of losing sight of reality in the pursuit of transient pleasures. Through its rich imagery, vivid dialogue, and exploration of complex themes, "The Strayed Reveller" invites readers to ponder the delicate balance between desire and responsibility, pleasure and consequence.
