## The Life Beyond by Rupert Brooke

```
He wakes, who never thought to wake again,
Who held the end was Death. He opens eyes
Slowly, to one long livid oozing plain
Closed down by the strange eyeless heavens. He lies;
And waits; and once in timeless sick surmise
Through the dead air heaves up an unknown hand,
Like a dry branch. No life is in that land,
Himself not lives, but is a thing that cries;
An unmeaning point upon the mud; a speck
Of moveless horror; an Immortal One
Cleansed of the world, sentient and dead; a fly
Fast-stuck in grey sweat on a corpse's neck.

I thought when love for you died, I should die.
It's dead. Alone, most strangely, I live on.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "The Life Beyond" by Rupert Brooke consists of two stanzas, the first one being longer than the second. It follows a free verse form, with irregular line lengths and no set rhyme scheme. The lack of a strict structure mirrors the chaotic and unsettling nature of the speaker's experience beyond death. The irregular line lengths also contribute to the sense of unease and disorientation in the poem. 

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem revolves around the idea of existence beyond death. The speaker wakes up in a desolate and lifeless landscape, devoid of any hope or meaning. The imagery used is bleak and haunting, with descriptions of a "long livid oozing plain" and "dead air." This imagery creates a sense of isolation and despair, highlighting the emptiness of the speaker's existence in this afterlife. 

The poem also touches upon the theme of love and loss. The speaker reflects on the death of love and how it has left them feeling alone and disconnected from the world. This theme adds a layer of emotional depth to the poem, contrasting the speaker's internal turmoil with the external desolation of the afterlife.

### Literary Devices

Brooke employs various literary devices to enhance the haunting atmosphere of the poem. The use of vivid imagery, such as "like a dry branch" and "moveless horror," creates a sense of unease and foreboding. The repetition of the word "dead" and the use of alliteration in "strange eyeless heavens" and "grey sweat" further contribute to the eerie tone of the poem.

The poem also features personification, as the speaker describes themselves as "an unmeaning point upon the mud" and "a fly / Fast-stuck in grey sweat on a corpse's neck." This personification serves to emphasize the speaker's sense of insignificance and powerlessness in this afterlife.

### Historical and Personal Context

Rupert Brooke was an English poet who lived during the early 20th century. He is known for his idealistic and patriotic poetry, particularly his war sonnets. "The Life Beyond" diverges from Brooke's usual themes of heroism and nationalism, instead exploring darker and more existential themes. This shift in focus may have been influenced by the turbulent events of the time, such as World War I, which brought about a sense of disillusionment and loss.

### Deep Reading

The poem delves into the existential dread of facing a life beyond death. The speaker's experience in this afterlife is one of loneliness, futility, and detachment. The imagery of a desolate landscape and the speaker's futile attempts to grasp onto something tangible convey a profound sense of emptiness and despair. The final lines, "I thought when love for you died, I should die. / It's dead. Alone, most strangely, I live on," encapsulate the speaker's profound sense of isolation and loss.

Overall, "The Life Beyond" is a haunting and introspective exploration of what lies beyond death, with themes of loneliness, loss, and the search for meaning in an empty existence. Through vivid imagery and powerful language, Brooke crafts a deeply evocative portrayal of the speaker's existential crisis in the afterlife.

## Original Poetry by Victor and Cazire by Percy Bysshe Shelley

```
Here I sit with my paper, my pen and my ink,
First of this thing, and that thing, and t'other thing think;
Then my thoughts come so pell-mell all into my mind,
That the sense or the subject I never can find:
This word is wrong placed,--no regard to the sense,
The present and future, instead of past tense,
Then my grammar I want; O dear! what a bore,
I think I shall never attempt to write more,
With patience I then my thoughts must arraign,
Have them all in due order like mutes in a train,
Like them too must wait in due patience and thought,
Or else my fine works will all come to nought.
My wit too's so copious, it flows like a river,
But disperses its waters on black and white never;
Like smoke it appears independent and free,
But ah luckless smoke! it all passes like thee--
Then at length all my patience entirely lost,
My paper and pens in the fire are tossed;
But come, try again--you must never despair,
Our Murray's or Entick's are not all so rare,
Implore their assistance--they'll come to your aid,
Perform all your business without being paid,
They'll tell you the present tense, future and past,
Which should come first, and which should come last,
This Murray will do--then to Entick repair,
To find out the meaning of any word rare.
This they friendly will tell, and ne'er make you blush,
With a jeering look, taunt, or an O fie! tush!
Then straight all your thoughts in black and white put,
Not minding the if's, the be's, and the but,
Then read it all over, see how it will run,
How answers the wit, the retort, and the pun,
Your writings may then with old Socrates vie,
May on the same shelf with Demosthenes lie,
May as Junius be sharp, or as Plato be sage.
The pattern or satire to all of the age;
But stop--a mad author I mean not to turn,
Nor with thirst of applause does my heated brain burn,
Sufficient that sense, wit, and grammar combined,
My letters may make some slight food for the mind;
That my thoughts to my friends I may freely impart,
In all the warm language that flows from the heart.
Hark! futurity calls! it loudly complains,
It bids me step forward and just hold the reins,
My excuse shall be humble, and faithful, and true,
Such as I fear can be made but by few--
Of writers this age has abundance and plenty,
Three score and a thousand, two millions and twenty,
Three score of them wits who all sharply vie,
To try what odd creature they best can belie,
A thousand are prudes who for CHARITY write,
And fill up their sheets with spleen, envy, and spite[,]
One million are bards, who to Heaven aspire,
And stuff their works full of bombast, rant, and fire,
T'other million are wags who in Grubstreet attend,
And just like a cobbler the old writings mend,
The twenty are those who for pulpits indite,
And pore over sermons all Saturday night.
And now my good friends--who come after I mean,
As I ne'er wore a cassock, or dined with a dean.
Or like cobblers at mending I never did try,
Nor with poets in lyrics attempted to vie;
As for prudes these good souls I both hate and detest,
So here I believe the matter must rest.--
I've heard your complaint--my answer I've made,
And since to your calls all the tribute I've paid,
Adieu my good friend; pray never despair,
But grammar and sense and everything dare,
Attempt but to write dashing, easy, and free,
Then take out your grammar and pay him his fee,
Be not a coward, shrink not to a tense,
But read it all over and make it out sense.
What a tiresome girl!--pray soon make an end,
Else my limited patience you'll quickly expend.
Well adieu, I no longer your patience will try--
So swift to the post now the letter shall fly.
```

## Patience Taught By Nature by Elizabeth Barrett Browning

```
'O DREARY life,' we cry, ' O dreary life ! '
And still the generations of the birds
Sing through our sighing, and the flocks and herds
Serenely live while we are keeping strife
With Heaven's true purpose in us, as a knife
Against which we may struggle ! Ocean girds
Unslackened the dry land, savannah-swards
Unweary sweep, hills watch unworn, and rife
Meek leaves drop year]y from the forest-trees
To show, above, the unwasted stars that pass
In their old glory: O thou God of old,
Grant me some smaller grace than comes to these !--
But so much patience as a blade of grass
Grows by, contented through the heat and cold.
```

## Today's Writing Challenge

**Form:** Sonnet

**Structure:** The sonnet consists of 14 lines, typically written in iambic pentameter. It is divided into two parts: an octave (8 lines) and a sestet (6 lines).

**Rhyme Scheme:** The most common rhyme schemes for a sonnet are ABAB CDCD EFEF GG or ABBA ABBA CDC DCD.

*Prompt: Write a sonnet exploring the bittersweet emotions of saying goodbye to a cherished childhood memory or place.*

### Word Suggestions

Consider these word pairs that complement your poem's tone:

- **abandon** (Germanic) / **relinquish** (Latinate)
  - *While both 'abandon' and 'relinquish' convey the idea of letting go, 'abandon' has a more abrupt and harsh connotation, suggesting a sense of desertion or neglect. On the other hand, 'relinquish' carries a softer and more deliberate tone, implying a voluntary surrender or release. For a poem exploring bittersweet emotions and nostalgia, 'relinquish' would better capture the wistful and reflective mood.*
  - **Recommended:** Use the latinate version to enhance your poem's tone

- **choose** (Germanic) / **opt** (Latinate)
  - *'Choose' is a straightforward and common word that implies making a decision among alternatives, while 'opt' is more formal and carries a sense of selecting the best or most favorable option. In the context of the poem's reflective and introspective tone, 'opt' would add a touch of elegance and sophistication, enhancing the emotional resonance of the sonnet.*
  - **Recommended:** Use the latinate version to enhance your poem's tone

- **wit** (Germanic) / **cognition** (Latinate)
  - *'Wit' refers to intelligence, cleverness, or humor, often associated with quick thinking and mental agility. On the other hand, 'cognition' is a more technical term related to the processes of acquiring knowledge and understanding. For a poem focused on childhood memories and the passage of time, 'wit' would evoke a sense of playfulness and innocence, aligning better with the nostalgic theme of the sonnet.*
  - **Recommended:** Use the germanic version to enhance your poem's tone
