## The Heretic's Tragedy: A Middle-Age Interlude by Robert Browning

```
The Lord, we look to once for all,
        Is the Lord we should look at, all at once:
He knows not to vary, saith Saint Paul,
        Nor the shadow of turning, for the nonce.
See him no other than as he is!
        Give both the infinitudes their due--
Infinite mercy, but, I wis,
        As infinite a justice too.

As infinite a justice too.

John, Master of the Temple of God,
        Falling to sin the Unknown Sin,
What he bought of Emperor Aldabrod,
        He sold it to Sultan Saladin:
Till, caught by Pope Clement, a-buzzing there,
        Hornet-prince of the mad wasps' hive,
And clipt of his wings in Paris square,
        They bring him now to be burned alive.
                        [And wanteth there grace of lute or
                                clavicithern, ye shall say to
                                confirm him who singeth--
        We bring John now to be burned alive.

In the midst is a goodly gallows built;
        'Twixt fork and fork, a stake is stuck;
But first they set divers tumbrils a-tilt,
        Make a trench all round with the city muck;
Inside they pile log upon log, good store;
        Faggots no few, blocks great and small,
Reach a man's mid-thigh, no less, no more,--
        For they mean he should roast in the sight of all.

        We mean he should roast in the sight of all.

Good sappy bavins that kindle forthwith;
        Billets that blaze substantial and slow;
Pine-stump split deftly, dry as pith;
        Larch-heart that chars to a chalk-white glow:
They up they hoist me John in a chafe,
        Sling him fast like a hog to scorch,
Spit in his face, then leap back safe,
Sing "Laudes" and bid clap-to the torch.

        Laus deo--who bids clap-to the torch.

John of the Temple, whose fame so bragged,
        Is burning alive in Paris square!
How can he curse, if his mouth is gagged?
        Or wriggle his neck, with a collar there?
Or heave his chest, which a band goes round?
        Or threat with his fist, since his arms are spliced?
Or kick with his feet, now his legs are bound?
        --Thinks John, I will call upon Jesus Christ.

Jesus Christ--John had bought and sold,
        Jesus Christ--John had eaten and drunk;
To him, the Flesh meant silver and gold.
        (Salva reverentia.)
Now it was, "Saviour, bountiful lamb,
        "I have roasted thee Turks, though men roast me!
"See thy servant, the plight wherein I am!
        "Art thou a saviour? Save thou me!"

       'Tis John the mocker cries, "Save thou me!"

Who maketh God's menace an idle word?
        --Saith, it no more means what it proclaims,
Than a damsel's threat to her wanton bird?
        For she too prattles of ugly names.
--Saith, he knoweth but one thing--what he knows?
        That God is good and the rest is breath;
Why else is the same styled Sharon's rose?
        Once a rose, ever a rose, he saith.

        O, John shall yet find a rose, he saith!

Alack, there be roses and roses, John!
        Some, honied of taste like your leman's  tongue:
Some, bitter; for why? (roast gaily on!)
        Their tree struck root in devil's-dung.
When Paul once reasoned of righteousness
        And of temperance and of judgment to come,
Good Felix trembled, he could no less:
        John, snickering, crook'd his wicked thumb.

        What cometh to John of the wicked thumb?

Ha ha, John plucketh now at his rose
        To rid himself of a sorrow at heart!
Lo,--petal on petal, fierce rays unclose;
        Anther on anther, sharp spikes outstart;
And with blood for dew, the bosom boils;
        And a gust of sulphur is all its smell;
And lo, he is horribly in the toils
        Of a coal-black giant flower of hell!

        What maketh heaven, That maketh hell.

So, as John called now, through the fire amain,
        On the Name, he had cursed with, all his life--
To the Person, he bought and sold again--
        For the Face, with his daily buffets rife--
Feature by feature It took its place:
        And his voice, like a mad dog's choking bark,
At the steady whole of the Judge's face--
        Died. Forth John's soul flared into the dark.

        God help all poor souls lost in the dark!

## Israfel by Edgar Allan Poe

```
In Heaven a spirit doth dwell
  "Whose heart-strings are a lute;"
None sing so wildly well
As the angel Israfel,
And the giddy Stars (so legends tell),
Ceasing their hymns, attend the spell
  Of his voice, all mute.

Tottering above
  In her highest noon,
  The enamoured Moon
Blushes with love,
  While, to listen, the red levin
  (With the rapid Pleiads, even,
  Which were seven),
  Pauses in Heaven.

And they say (the starry choir
  And the other listening things)
That Israfeli's fire
Is owing to that lyre
  By which he sits and sings--
The trembling living wire
Of those unusual strings.

But the skies that angel trod,
  Where deep thoughts are a duty--
Where Love's a grow-up God--
  Where the Houri glances are
Imbued with all the beauty
  Which we worship in a star.

Therefore, thou art not wrong,
  Israfeli, who despisest
An unimpassioned song;
To thee the laurels belong,
  Best bard, because the wisest!
Merrily live and long!

The ecstasies above
  With thy burning measures suit--
Thy grief, thy joy, thy hate, thy love,
  With the fervor of thy lute--
  Well may the stars be mute!

Yes, Heaven is thine; but this
  Is a world of sweets and sours;
  Our flowers are merely--flowers,
And the shadow of thy perfect bliss
  Is the sunshine of ours.

If I could dwell
Where Israfel
  Hath dwelt, and he where I,
He might not sing so wildly well
  A mortal melody,
While a bolder note than this might swell
  From my lyre within the sky.
```

## I Wandered Lonely As A Cloud by William Wordsworth

```
I wandered lonely as a cloud
That floats on high o'er vales and hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
A host, of golden daffodils;
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.

Continuous as the stars that shine
And twinkle on the milky way,
They stretched in never-ending line
Along the margin of a bay:
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.

 The waves beside them danced, but they
Out-did the sparkling leaves in glee;
A poet could not be but gay,
In such a jocund company!
I gazed—and gazed—but little thought
What wealth the show to me had brought:

For oft, when on my couch I lie
In vacant or in pensive mood,
They flash upon that inward eye
Which is the bliss of solitude;
And then my heart with pleasure fills,
And dances with the daffodils.
```
