## A Letter to a Live Poet by Rupert Brooke

```
Sir, since the last Elizabethan died,
Or, rather, that more Paradisal muse,
Blind with much light, passed to the light more glorious
Or deeper blindness, no man's hand, as thine,
Has, on the world's most noblest chord of song,
Struck certain magic strains. Ears satiate
With the clamorous, timorous whisperings of to-day,
Thrilled to perceive once more the spacious voice
And serene unterrance of old. We heard
-- With rapturous breath half-held, as a dreamer dreams
Who dares not know it dreaming, lest he wake --
The odorous, amorous style of poetry,
The melancholy knocking of those lines,
The long, low soughing of pentameters,
-- Or the sharp of rhyme as a bird's cry --
And the innumerable truant polysyllables
Multitudinously twittering like a bee.
Fulfilled our hearts were with the music then,
And all the evenings sighed it to the dawn,
And all the lovers heard it from all the trees.
All of the accents upon the all the norms!
-- And ah! the stress of the penultimate!
We never knew blank verse could have such feet.

Where is it now? Oh, more than ever, now
I sometimes think no poetry is read
Save where some sepultured Cѕsura bled,
Royally incarnadining all the line.
Is the imperial iamb laid to rest,
And the young trochee, having done enough?
Ah! turn again! Sing so to us, who are sick
Of seeming-simple rhymes, bizarre emotions,
Decked in the simple verses of the day,
Infinite meaning in a little gloom,
Irregular thoughts in stanzas regular,
Modern despair in antique metres, myths
Incomprehensible at evening,
And symbols that mean nothing in the dawn.
The slow lines swell. The new style sighs. The Celt
Moans round with many voices.
God! to see
Gaunt anapѕsts stand up out of the verse,
Combative accents, stress where no stress should be,
Spondee on spondee, iamb on choriamb,
The thrill of all the tribrachs in the world,
And all the vowels rising to the E!
To hear the blessed mutter of those verbs,
Conjunctions passionate toward each other's arms,
And epithets like amaranthine lovers
Stretching luxuriously to the stars,
All prouder pronouns than the dawn, and all
The thunder of the trumpets of the noun!
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

In this poem, Rupert Brooke addresses a live poet, lamenting the lack of traditional poetic forms and styles in contemporary poetry. The poem is structured as a letter, with the speaker expressing their longing for the return of the "magic strains" of old poetry. The meter is predominantly iambic, reflecting the traditional rhythm of classical poetry. Brooke also uses rhyme throughout the poem, such as in the lines "modern despair in antique metres, myths / incomprehensible at evening." This rhyme scheme adds musicality to the poem and emphasizes the speaker's plea for the return of classic poetic forms.

### Themes and Imagery

The main theme of the poem is the speaker's yearning for the return of traditional poetic styles and forms. Brooke uses vivid imagery to convey this longing, such as "the odorous, amorous style of poetry" and "the long, low soughing of pentameters." These images evoke a sense of nostalgia for the beauty and depth of classic poetry. The speaker also contrasts contemporary poetry, which they describe as "seeming-simple rhymes, bizarre emotions," with the rich and intricate language of old poetry. The imagery in the poem serves to highlight the speaker's desire for a return to more elaborate and meaningful poetic expression.

### Literary Devices

Brooke employs a variety of literary devices in the poem to enhance its impact. One such device is alliteration, as seen in the line "the slow lines swell." This repetition of the "s" sound creates a sense of fluidity and movement in the poem. Another literary device used is personification, as in "the stress of the penultimate." Here, the stress of the penultimate syllable is given human-like qualities, adding depth to the description of poetic meter. Brooke also uses metaphor, such as "gaunt anapѕsts stand up out of the verse," to convey the speaker's desire for more complex and challenging poetic forms.

### Historical and Personal Context

Written during the early 20th century, when modernist poetry was gaining popularity, this poem reflects Brooke's personal preference for traditional poetic forms. The speaker's lament for the decline of classical poetry can be seen as a reaction to the experimental and avant-garde styles emerging in the literary world at that time. Brooke's desire for the return of classic poetic styles may also be influenced by his own background as a poet who favored more traditional forms and themes in his work.

### Deep Reading

At its core, "A Letter to a Live Poet" is a passionate plea for the revival of traditional poetic forms and styles in a time when experimental and modernist poetry was on the rise. The speaker's longing for the "magic strains" of old poetry reflects a deeper yearning for the beauty, complexity, and depth that traditional poetic forms can offer. Through vivid imagery, literary devices, and personal lament, Brooke crafts a compelling argument for the enduring power and importance of classic poetry in a world that is constantly evolving and changing.

## A Pæan by Edgar Allan Poe

```
How shall the burial rite be read?
  The solemn song be sung?
The requiem for the loveliest dead,
  That ever died so young?

Her friends are gazing on her,
  And on her gaudy bier,
And weep!--oh! to dishonor
  Dead beauty with a tear!

They loved her for her wealth--
  And they hated her for her pride--
But she grew in feeble health,
  And they _love_ her--that she died.

They tell me (while they speak
  Of her "costly broider'd pall")
That my voice is growing weak--
  That I should not sing at all--

Or that my tone should be
  Tun'd to such solemn song
So mournfully--so mournfully,
  That the dead may feel no wrong.

But she is gone above,
  With young Hope at her side,
And I am drunk with love
  Of the dead, who is my bride.--

Of the dead--dead who lies
  All perfum'd there,
With the death upon her eyes.
  And the life upon her hair.

Thus on the coffin loud and long
  I strike--the murmur sent
Through the gray chambers to my song,
  Shall be the accompaniment.

Thou diedst in thy life's June--
  But thou didst not die too fair:
Thou didst not die too soon,
  Nor with too calm an air.

From more than friends on earth,
  Thy life and love are riven,
To join the untainted mirth
  Of more than thrones in heaven.--

Therefore, to thee this night
  I will no requiem raise,
But waft thee on thy flight,
  With a Pæan of old days.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

In terms of form, "A Pæan" by Edgar Allan Poe is structured as a poem with seven stanzas, each containing four lines. The poem follows a consistent AABB rhyme scheme, where the second and fourth lines rhyme with each other. This rhyme scheme gives the poem a musical quality and helps to emphasize certain key words and ideas. The meter of the poem is primarily iambic tetrameter, with four metrical feet per line following a stressed-unstressed pattern. This regular meter contributes to the poem's overall rhythmic flow and adds to its lyrical quality.

### Themes and Imagery

The central themes of the poem revolve around death, beauty, love, and grief. The speaker laments the death of a young woman who was both loved and hated by those around her. The imagery used in the poem is rich and vivid, evoking a sense of mourning and melancholy. The description of the dead woman lying in her coffin, perfumed and adorned, creates a haunting image of beauty in death. The contrast between the physical beauty of the deceased woman and the sorrow felt by those around her highlights the complexities of human emotions in the face of loss.

### Literary Devices

Poe employs several literary devices in "A Pæan" to enhance its thematic depth and emotional impact. One such device is alliteration, as seen in the repetition of the "d" sound in the lines "All perfum'd there, / With the death upon her eyes." This repetition creates a sense of somberness and echoes the theme of death throughout the poem. Additionally, Poe uses personification when he speaks of the dead woman having "the life upon her hair," giving life-like qualities to the deceased. The poem also features imagery, metaphor, and symbolism to convey the speaker's complex feelings towards the deceased woman and the act of mourning.

### Historical and Personal Context

Edgar Allan Poe, known for his dark and macabre themes, often explored the themes of death and loss in his works. "A Pæan" reflects Poe's fascination with mortality and the beauty that can be found in death. The poem may also be influenced by Poe's personal experiences with grief and loss, as he suffered many tragic losses throughout his life, including the death of his young wife, Virginia Clemm. This personal context adds a layer of emotional depth to the poem and helps to illuminate Poe's complex relationship with death and beauty.

### Deep Reading

At its core, "A Pæan" delves into the paradoxical nature of human emotions in the face of death. The speaker's conflicted feelings towards the deceased woman, oscillating between love, grief, and even reverence, reflect the complexities of mourning and loss. The poem challenges traditional notions of mourning and burial rites, suggesting that beauty and love can transcend death and elevate the deceased to a higher realm. Ultimately, Poe's exploration of death and beauty in "A Pæan" serves as a meditation on the nature of mortality and the enduring power of love and remembrance.
