## The Night Journey by Rupert Brooke

```
Hands and lit faces eddy to a line;
The dazed last minutes click; the clamour dies.
Beyond the great-swung arc o' the roof, divine,
Night, smoky-scarv'd, with thousand coloured eyes

Glares the imperious mystery of the way.
Thirsty for dark, you feel the long-limbed train
Throb, stretch, thrill motion, slide, pull out and sway,
Strain for the far, pause, draw to strength again. . . .

As a man, caught by some great hour, will rise,
Slow-limbed, to meet the light or find his love;
And, breathing long, with staring sightless eyes,
Hands out, head back, agape and silent, move

Sure as a flood, smooth as a vast wind blowing;
And, gathering power and purpose as he goes,
Unstumbling, unreluctant, strong, unknowing,
Borne by a will not his, that lifts, that grows,

Sweep out to darkness, triumphing in his goal,
Out of the fire, out of the little room. . . .
-- There is an end appointed, O my soul!
Crimson and green the signals burn; the gloom

Is hung with steam's far-blowing livid streamers.
Lost into God, as lights in light, we fly,
Grown one with will, end-drunken huddled dreamers.
The white lights roar. The sounds of the world die.

And lips and laughter are forgotten things.
Speed sharpens; grows. Into the night, and on,
The strength and splendour of our purpose swings.
The lamps fade; and the stars. We are alone.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

Rupert Brooke's poem "The Night Journey" is structured as a single stanza of 28 lines. The poem does not follow a consistent rhyme scheme or meter, giving it a free verse form. This lack of rhyme and meter adds to the sense of movement and unpredictability in the poem, mirroring the train journey it describes. The long, flowing lines create a sense of motion and momentum, echoing the train's movement through the night.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem is the transformative power of a journey, both physical and metaphorical. The night journey on the train symbolizes a journey towards an unknown destination, a journey of self-discovery and spiritual awakening. The imagery of the train moving through the night, with its "thirsty for dark" engine and the passengers becoming "end-drunken huddled dreamers," evokes a sense of mystery and exhilaration. The use of vivid imagery, such as "the great-swung arc o' the roof" and "thousand coloured eyes," creates a surreal and dreamlike atmosphere.

### Literary Devices

Brooke employs various literary devices to enhance the poem's themes and imagery. The use of personification is evident in lines such as "Night, smoky-scarv'd, with thousand coloured eyes," giving the night a mysterious and almost sentient quality. The repetition of the word "unstumbling" emphasizes the idea of moving forward with determination and purpose. Brooke also uses similes, such as "smooth as a vast wind blowing," to create vivid comparisons and enhance the sense of movement in the poem.

### Historical and Personal Context

Written during the early 20th century, Rupert Brooke's poem reflects the modernist movement in literature, characterized by experimentation with form and a focus on individual experience and perception. The poem can also be seen in the context of Brooke's own personal experiences, as he was known for his adventurous spirit and travels. The theme of a journey towards self-discovery may reflect Brooke's own search for meaning and purpose in a rapidly changing world.

### Deep Reading

The poem "The Night Journey" can be interpreted as a metaphor for the journey of life itself, with its unknown destination and the transformative power of experience. The train journey symbolizes the passage from one stage of life to another, with the passengers swept along by forces beyond their control. The poem suggests a sense of inevitability and destiny, as the passengers are "borne by a will not his, that lifts, that grows." Ultimately, the poem conveys a sense of awe and wonder at the mysteries of existence, as the travelers are "lost into God" and become "one with will." It is a powerful and evocative exploration of the human experience and the journey towards self-discovery and enlightenment.

## Bereavement in their death to feel by Emily Dickinson

```
Bereavement in their death to feel
Whom We have never seen --
A Vital Kinsmanship import
Our Soul and theirs -- between --

For Stranger -- Strangers do not mourn --
There be Immortal friends
Whom Death see first -- 'tis news of this
That paralyze Ourselves --

Who, vital only to Our Thought --
Such Presence bear away
In dying -- 'tis as if Our Souls
Absconded -- suddenly --
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme
In terms of form, this poem by Emily Dickinson consists of four quatrains, with a consistent rhyme scheme of ABAB. The meter is predominantly iambic tetrameter, with lines alternating between four and three stressed syllables. This alternating meter creates a sense of rhythm and flow in the poem. The structure is quite regular, with each stanza containing four lines that explore the theme of bereavement.

### Themes and Imagery
The central theme of the poem is the profound impact of losing someone we have never met but feel a deep connection to. Dickinson explores the idea that there can be a spiritual kinship between individuals that transcends physical presence. The imagery used in the poem is powerful, with phrases like "A Vital Kinsmanship import" and "Such Presence bear away" conveying the intensity of the emotional connection between souls.

### Literary Devices
Dickinson employs several literary devices in this poem, including personification, metaphor, and paradox. The personification of death as someone who "paralyze[s] Ourselves" adds a haunting quality to the poem. The metaphor of souls "Absconded -- suddenly" suggests a sense of loss and disappearance. Additionally, the paradox of feeling bereavement for strangers emphasizes the complex nature of human emotions.

### Historical and Personal Context
Emily Dickinson wrote this poem during the 19th century, a time marked by high mortality rates and widespread grieving due to illnesses and wars. Dickinson herself experienced significant losses in her life, including the death of close family members and friends. Her personal experiences likely influenced her exploration of themes related to death, grief, and spiritual connections in her poetry.

### Deep Reading
Through this poem, Emily Dickinson delves into the profound emotional impact of losing someone we have never met but feel a deep connection to. The idea that there can be a sense of kinship and intimacy with individuals we have never seen challenges traditional notions of mourning and grief. Dickinson suggests that the bond between souls can be so strong that the loss of someone unknown to us can feel as if a part of our own soul has been taken away. This exploration of the complexities of human emotions and spiritual connections adds depth and richness to the poem, inviting readers to reflect on the nature of bereavement and the enduring power of relationships beyond physical presence.
