## No, Thank You John by Christina Rossetti

```
I never said I loved you, John:
Why will you tease me day by day,
And wax a weariness to think upon
With always "do" and "pray"?

You Know I never loved you, John;
No fault of mine made me your toast:
Why will you haunt me with a face as wan
As shows an hour-old ghost?

I dare say Meg or Moll would take
Pity upon you, if you'd ask:
And pray don't remain single for my sake
Who can't perform the task.

I have no heart?-Perhaps I have not;
But then you're mad to take offence
That don't give you what I have not got:
Use your common sense.

Let bygones be bygones:
Don't call me false, who owed not to be true:
I'd rather answer "No" to fifty Johns
Than answer "Yes" to you.

Let's mar our plesant days no more,
Song-birds of passage, days of youth:
Catch at today, forget the days before:
I'll wink at your untruth.

Let us strike hands as hearty friends;
No more, no less; and friendship's good:
Only don't keep in veiw ulterior ends, And points not understood

In open treaty. Rise above
Quibbles and shuffling off and on:
Here's friendship for you if you like; but love,-
No, thank you, John.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

Christina Rossetti's poem "No, Thank You John" consists of 35 lines divided into six stanzas with varying line lengths, giving it a free verse form. The lack of a consistent meter or rhyme scheme reflects the speaker's casual and conversational tone as she addresses John.

### Themes and Imagery

The poem explores themes of unrequited love, independence, and friendship. The speaker repeatedly asserts that she does not love John and urges him to move on, highlighting her agency and autonomy in matters of the heart. The imagery of "haunt me with a face as wan / As shows an hour-old ghost" vividly conveys the speaker's feelings of discomfort and unease at John's persistent advances. The reference to "song-birds of passage, days of youth" suggests the fleeting nature of youth and the importance of seizing the present moment.

### Literary Devices

Rossetti employs various literary devices to convey the speaker's emotions and intentions. The repetition of "No, thank you, John" at the beginning and end of the poem serves as a refrain, reinforcing the speaker's firm rejection of John's advances. The use of rhetorical questions, such as "Why will you tease me day by day," adds a sense of frustration and exasperation to the speaker's tone. The metaphor of "Song-birds of passage" conveys the transient nature of youth and relationships, emphasizing the fleeting nature of love.

The poem serves as a powerful assertion of agency and independence in the face of societal norms and expectations.

## Summer in the South by Paul Laurence Dunbar

```
The Oriole sings in the greening grove
As if he were half-way waiting,
The rosebuds peep from their hoods of green,
Timid, and hesitating.
The rain comes down in a torrent sweep
And the nights smell warm and pinety,
The garden thrives, but the tender shoots
Are yellow-green and tiny.
Then a flash of sun on a waiting hill,
Streams laugh that erst were quiet,
The sky smiles down with a dazzling blue
And the woods run mad with riot.
```

## Home-Thoughts, From the Sea by Robert Browning

```
Nobly, nobly, Cape Saint Vincent to the Northwest died away;
Sunset ran, one glorious blood-red, reeking into Cadiz Bay;
Bluish 'mid the burning water, full in face Trafalgar lay;

In the dimmest Northeast distance dawned Gibraltar grand and gray;
"Here and here did England help me: how can I help England?"--say,
Whoso turns as I, this evening, turn to God and pray,
While Jove's planet rises yonder, silent over Africa.
```
