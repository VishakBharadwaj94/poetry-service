## Israfel by Edgar Allan Poe

```
In Heaven a spirit doth dwell
  "Whose heart-strings are a lute;"
None sing so wildly well
As the angel Israfel,
And the giddy Stars (so legends tell),
Ceasing their hymns, attend the spell
  Of his voice, all mute.

Tottering above
  In her highest noon,
  The enamoured Moon
Blushes with love,
  While, to listen, the red levin
  (With the rapid Pleiads, even,
  Which were seven),
  Pauses in Heaven.

And they say (the starry choir
  And the other listening things)
That Israfeli's fire
Is owing to that lyre
  By which he sits and sings--
The trembling living wire
Of those unusual strings.

But the skies that angel trod,
  Where deep thoughts are a duty--
Where Love's a grow-up God--
  Where the Houri glances are
Imbued with all the beauty
  Which we worship in a star.

Therefore, thou art not wrong,
  Israfeli, who despisest
An unimpassioned song;
To thee the laurels belong,
  Best bard, because the wisest!
Merrily live and long!

The ecstasies above
  With thy burning measures suit--
Thy grief, thy joy, thy hate, thy love,
  With the fervor of thy lute--
  Well may the stars be mute!

Yes, Heaven is thine; but this
  Is a world of sweets and sours;
  Our flowers are merely--flowers,
And the shadow of thy perfect bliss
  Is the sunshine of ours.

If I could dwell
Where Israfel
  Hath dwelt, and he where I,
He might not sing so wildly well
  A mortal melody,
While a bolder note than this might swell
  From my lyre within the sky.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The first stanza sets the tone with an ABAB rhyme scheme, while the following stanzas vary in rhyme scheme, contributing to the musicality of the poem. The meter is predominantly iambic tetrameter, with lines consisting of four metrical feet. This rhythmic pattern creates a lyrical quality that mimics the music and song attributed to Israfel in the poem.

### Themes and Imagery

The central themes of the poem revolve around music, heavenly beauty, and the power of artistic expression. Israfel is portrayed as a celestial being whose music is so captivating that even the stars fall silent to listen. The imagery of Israfel's angelic presence, the enamored Moon blushing with love, and the starry choir praising his fire all contribute to a sense of otherworldly beauty and transcendence.

### Literary Devices

Poe employs several literary devices to enhance the poem's aesthetic and emotional impact. Personification is used to attribute human qualities to abstract concepts, such as the Moon blushing with love. Metaphors, such as the comparison of Israfel's voice to a lute and the stars being mute in his presence, add depth to the imagery. Alliteration, as seen in "giddy Stars," "red levin," and "rapid Pleiads," creates a melodic quality that mirrors the musical themes of the poem.

### Historical and Personal Context

Written in the 1830s, "Israfel" reflects Poe's fascination with themes of beauty, music, and the supernatural. Poe's own struggles with loss and longing for ideal beauty are evident in the poem's exploration of heavenly bliss contrasted with earthly imperfections. The poem also draws on Islamic and Persian mythology, particularly the figure of Israfil (Israfel in the poem), the angel associated with music and song.

### Deep Reading

At its core, "Israfel" delves into the tension between earthly existence and heavenly perfection. Israfel represents the ideal artist whose passion and creativity transcend mortal limitations. The poem suggests that true artistry requires intense emotion and a rejection of mere superficial beauty. By emphasizing the divine nature of artistic inspiration, Poe elevates the role of the poet as a conduit for higher truths and emotions. Ultimately, "Israfel" serves as a tribute to the power of music and poetry to transcend the mundane and touch the sublime.
