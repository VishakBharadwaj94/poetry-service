## Winter Song by Wilfred Owen

```
The browns, the olives, and the yellows died,
And were swept up to heaven; where they glowed
Each dawn and set of sun till Christmastide,
And when the land lay pale for them, pale-snowed,
Fell back, and down the snow-drifts flamed and flowed.

From off your face, into the winds of winter,
The sun-brown and the summer-gold are blowing;
But they shall gleam with spiritual glinter,
When paler beauty on your brows falls snowing,
And through those snows my looks shall be soft-going.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "Winter Song" by Wilfred Owen consists of two stanzas, each with six lines. The poem follows a consistent rhyme scheme of ABABCC, where the second and fourth lines rhyme with each other, and the last two lines of each stanza rhyme with each other. This structured rhyme scheme creates a sense of musicality and cohesion in the poem.

In terms of meter, the poem does not strictly adhere to a specific meter such as iambic pentameter. However, the lines are relatively uniform in length and follow a rhythmic pattern that flows smoothly when read aloud. The lack of strict meter allows for a more natural and conversational tone in the poem.

The form and structure of the poem mirror the themes of transition and transformation, as the changing seasons are reflected in the shifting rhyme scheme and rhythmic patterns of the verses.

### Themes and Imagery

One of the central themes of the poem is the cyclical nature of life, as symbolized by the changing seasons. The imagery of the browns, olives, and yellows dying and being swept up to heaven conveys a sense of transformation and renewal. The transition from autumn to winter is depicted as a spiritual process, where the colors of summer give way to the paleness of winter.

The imagery of snow and snow-drifts further emphasizes the theme of transformation, as the landscape is described as being "pale-snowed" and the snow-drifts "flamed and flowed." This juxtaposition of cold and warmth, light and darkness, reflects the complex interplay between life and death, growth and decay.

The contrast between the external landscape and the internal emotions of the speaker is also explored through imagery. The speaker describes how the sun-brown and summer-gold are blowing off their face into the winds of winter, symbolizing a loss of external beauty. However, the speaker also suggests that true beauty lies within, as the paler beauty of snow on the brows is highlighted as a source of spiritual gleam.

### Literary Devices

Owen employs several literary devices to enhance the themes and imagery of the poem. The use of alliteration in phrases such as "sun-brown and summer-gold" and "paler beauty on your brows falls snowing" creates a sense of musicality and rhythm in the poem. The repetition of sounds emphasizes the cyclical nature of the changing seasons.

Personification is also used, as the colors of autumn are described as dying and being swept up to heaven, where they glow each dawn and set of sun. This personification imbues the natural world with a sense of agency and spirituality, highlighting the interconnectedness between nature and the divine.

The use of metaphor is prevalent in the poem, particularly in the comparison between external beauty (sun-brown and summer-gold) and inner beauty (paler beauty on your brows). This metaphorical contrast underscores the idea that true beauty is not superficial but resides in the soul.

### Historical and Personal Context

Wilfred Owen was a British poet who served as a soldier in World War I, and his experiences in the war deeply influenced his poetry. While "Winter Song" does not directly address the horrors of war, it reflects Owen's preoccupation with themes of transformation, loss, and renewal. The imagery of death and rebirth in the poem can be seen as a reflection of Owen's own experiences on the battlefield.

Additionally, Owen's personal struggles with his own sense of identity and spirituality are reflected in the poem. The juxtaposition of external and internal beauty, as well as the idea of finding solace in the midst of loss, may resonate with Owen's own search for meaning and purpose in a world marked by destruction and despair.

### Deep Reading

On a deeper level, "Winter Song" can be interpreted as a meditation on the passage of time and the inevitability of change. The shifting seasons serve as a metaphor for the transience of human existence, as everything eventually fades and is renewed. The poem suggests that beauty is not static but is constantly evolving, much like the natural world.

Furthermore, the poem can be seen as a reflection on the interconnectedness of all things, as the colors of autumn are transformed into the snows of winter. This cycle of death and rebirth highlights the eternal rhythms of nature and the interconnectedness of all living beings.

Ultimately, "Winter Song" invites readers to contemplate the beauty and fragility of life, and to find solace in the knowledge that even in the depths of winter, there is the promise of spring. The poem serves as a poignant reminder of the cyclical nature of existence and the enduring power of renewal.

## Lines Written In Early Spring by William Wordsworth

```
I heard a thousand blended notes,
While in a grove I sate reclined,
In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts
Bring sad thoughts to the mind.

To her fair works did Nature link
The human soul that through me ran;
And much it grieved my heart to think
What man has made of man.

Through primrose tufts, in that green bower,
The periwinkle trailed its wreaths;
And 'tis my faith that every flower
Enjoys the air it breathes.

The birds around me hopped and played,
Their thoughts I cannot measure:--
But the least motion which they made
It seemed a thrill of pleasure.

The budding twigs spread out their fan,
To catch the breezy air;
And I must think, do all I can,
That there was pleasure there.

If this belief from heaven be sent,
If such be Nature's holy plan,
Have I not reason to lament
What man has made of man?
```

Wordsworth utilizes vivid imagery throughout the poem to evoke the sensory experience of being surrounded by nature in early spring. Descriptions of birds chirping, flowers blooming, and twigs swaying in the breeze create a lush and vibrant picture of the natural world. The imagery of the poem serves to emphasize the speaker's deep emotional connection to nature and his profound sense of loss and sadness at the state of humanity.

### Literary Devices

Wordsworth employs several literary devices in the poem to convey his message effectively. One such device is personification, as he attributes human-like qualities to nature, such as the flowers enjoying the air they breathe and the twigs spreading out to catch the breeze. This personification serves to emphasize the interconnectedness of nature and humanity. Additionally, there is a use of paradox in the line "In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts / Bring sad thoughts to the mind," highlighting the bittersweet nature of the speaker's reflections on nature and humanity.

### Historical and Personal Context

Wordsworth was a leading figure in the Romantic movement, which placed a strong emphasis on the beauty of nature, individual emotion, and the power of the imagination. The poem reflects Wordsworth's belief in the healing and transformative power of nature, as well as his concerns about the detrimental effects of industrialization and urbanization on the natural world. The Industrial Revolution was in full swing during Wordsworth's lifetime, and the poem can be seen as a response to the rapid social and environmental changes taking place during that time.

### Deep Reading

Ultimately, Wordsworth's poem urges readers to reflect on their own relationship with nature and consider the consequences of their actions on the world around them.
