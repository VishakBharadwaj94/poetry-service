## An Epistle: Containing the Strange Medical Experience of Karshish, the Arab Physician by Robert Browning

```
Karshish, the picker up of learning's crumbs,
The not incurious in God's handiwork
(This man's flesh he hath admirably made,
Blown like a bubble, kneaded like a paste,
To coop up and keep down on earth a space
That puff of vapour from his mouth, man's soul)
--To Abib, all sagacious in our art,
Breeder in me of what poor skill I boast,
Like me inquisitive how pricks and cracks
Befall the flesh through too much stress and strain,
Whereby the wily vapour fain would slip
Back and rejoin its source before the term,--
And aptest in contrivance (under God)
To baffle it by deftly stopping such--
The vagrant Scholar to his Sage at home
Sends greeting (health and knowledge, fame with peace)
Three samples of true snake-stone--rarer still,
One of the other sort, the melon-shaped,
(But fitter, pounded fine, for charms than drugs)
And writeth now the twenty-second time.

My journeyings were brought to Jericho:
Thus I resume. Who studious in our art
Shall count a little labour unrepaid?
I have shed sweat enough, left flesh and bone
On many a flinty furlong of this land.
Also, the country-side is all on fire
With rumours of a marching hitherward:
Some say Vespasian cometh, some, his son.
A black lynx snarled and pricked a tufted ear:
Lust of my blood inflamed his yellow balls:
I cried and threw my staff and he was gone.
Twice have the robbers stripped and beaten me,
And once a town declared me for a spy;
But at the end, I reach Jerusalem,
Since this poor covert where I pass the night,
This Bethany, lies scarce the distance thence
A man with plague-sores at the third degree
Runs till he drops down dead. Thou laughest here!
'Sooth, it elates me, thus reposed and safe,
To void the stuffing of my travel-scrip
And share with thee whatever Jewry yields.
A viscid choler is observable
In tertians, I was nearly bold to say;
And falling-sickness hath a happier cure
Than our school wots of: there's a spider here
Weaves no web, watches on the ledge of tombs,
Sprinkled with mottles on an ash-gray back;
Take five and drop them ... but who knows his mind,
The Syrian run-a-gate I trust this to?
His service payeth me a sublimate
Blown up his nose to help the ailing eye.
Best wait: I reach Jerusalem at morn,
There set in order my experiences,
Gather what most deserves, and give thee all--
Or I might add, Judæa's gum-tragacanth
Scales off in purer flakes, shines clearer-grained,
Cracks 'twixt the pestle and the porphyry.
In fine exceeds our produce. Scalp-disease
Confounds me, crossing so with leprosy:
Thou hadst admired one sort I gained at Zoar--
But zeal outruns discretion. Here I end.

Yet stay! my Syrian blinketh gratefully,
Protested his devotion is my price--
Suppose I write, what harms not, tho' he steal?
I half resolve to tell thee, yet I blush,
What set me off a-writing first of all.
An itch I had, a sting to write, a tang!
For, be it this town's barrenness--or else
The man had something in the look of him--
His case has struck me far more than 'tis worth.
So, pardon if--(lest presently I lose,
In the great press of novelty at hand,
The care and pains this somehow stole from me)
I bid thee take the thing while fresh in mind.
Almost in sight--for, wilt thou have the truth?
The very man is gone from me but now,
Whose ailment is the subject of discourse.
Thus then, and let thy better wit help all!

'Tis but a case of mania: subinduced
By epilepsy, at the turning-point
Of trance prolonged unduly some three days
When, by the exhibition of some drug
Or spell, exorcisation, stroke of art
Unknown to me and which 'twere well to know,
The evil thing, out-breaking all at once,
Left the man whole and sound of body indeed,--
But, flinging (so to speak) life's gates too wide,
Making a clear house of it too suddenly,
The first conceit that entered might inscribe
Whatever it was minded on the wall
So plainly at that vantage, as it were,
(First come, first served) that nothing subsequent
Attaineth to erase those fancy-scrawls
The just-returned and new-established soul
Hath gotten now so thoroughly by heart
That henceforth she will read or these or none.
And first--the man's own firm conviction rests
That he was dead (in fact they buried him)
--That he was dead and then restored to life
By a Nazarene physician of his tribe:
--'Sayeth, the same bade "Rise," and he did rise,
"Such cases are diurnal," thou wilt cry.
Not so this figment!--not, that such a fume,
Instead of giving way to time and health,
Should eat itself into the life of life.
As saffron tingeth flesh, blood, bones, and all!
For see, how he takes up the after-life,
The man--it is one Lazarus, a Jew,
Sanguine, proportioned, fifty years of age,
The body's habit wholly laudable,
As much, indeed, beyond the common health.
As he were made and put aside to show.
Think, could we penetrate by any drug
And bathe the wearied soul and worried flesh,
And bring it clear and fair, by three days' sleep!
Whence has the man the balm that brightens all?
This grown man eyes the world now like a child.
Some elders of his tribe, I should premise,
Led in their friend, obedient as a sheep,
To bear my inquisition. While they spoke,
Now sharply, now with sorrow,--told the case,--
He listened not except I spoke to him,
But folded his two hands and let them talk,
Watching the flies that buzzed: and yet no fool.
And that's a sample how his years must go.

Look if a beggar, in fixed middle-life,
Should find a treasure,--can he use the same
With straitened habits and with tastes starved small,
And take at once to his impoverished brain
The sudden element that changes things,
That sets the undreamed-of rapture at his hand,
And puts the cheap old joy in the scorned dust?
Is he not such an one as moves to mirth--
Warily parsimonious, when no need,
Wasteful as drunkenness at undue times?
All prudent counsel as to what befits
The golden mean, is lost on such an one:
The man's fantastic will is the man's law.
So here--we call the treasure knowledge, say,
Increased beyond the fleshly faculty--
Heaven opened to a soul while yet on earth,
Earth forced on a soul's use while seeing heaven:
The man is witless of the size, the sum,
The value in proportion of all things,
Or whether it be little or be much.
Discourse to him of prodigious armaments
Assembled to besiege his city now,
And of the passing of a mule with gourds--
'Tis one! Then take it on the other side,
Speak of some trifling fact,--he will gaze rapt
With stupor at its very littleness,
(Far as I see) as if in that indeed
He caught prodigious import, whole results.
And so will turn to us the bystanders
In ever the same stupor (note this point)
That we too see not with his opened eyes.
Wonder and doubt come wrongly into play,
Preposterously, at cross purposes.
Should his child sicken unto death,--why, look
For scarce abatement of his cheerfulness,
Or pretermission of the daily craft!
While a word, gesture, glance from that same child
At play or in the school or laid asleep,
Will startle him to an agony of fear,
Exasperation, just as like. Demand
The reason why--"'tis but a word," object--
"A gesture"--he regards thee as our lord
Who lived there in the pyramid alone,
Looked at us (dost thou mind?) when, being young
We both would unadvisedly recite
Some charm's beginning, from that book of his,
Able to bid the sun throb wide and burst
All into stars, as suns grown old are wont.
Thou and the child have each a veil alike
Thrown o'er your heads, from under which ye both
Stretch your blind hands and trifle with a match
Over a mine of Greek fire, did ye know!
He holds on firmly to some thread of life
(It is the life to lead perforcedly)
Which runs across some vast distracting orb
Of glory on either side that meagre thread,
Which, conscious of, he must not enter yet--
The spiritual life around the earthly life:
The law of that is known to him as this,
His heart and brain move there, his feet stay here.
So is the man perplext with impulses
Sudden to start off crosswise, not straight on,
Proclaiming what is right and wrong across,
And not along, this black thread thro' the blaze--
"It should be" balked by "here it cannot be."
And oft the man's soul springs into his face
As if he saw again and heard again
His sage that bade him "Rise" and he did rise.
Something, a word, a tick o' the blood within
Admonishes: then back he sinks at once
To ashes, who was very fire before,
In sedulous recurrence to his trade
Whereby he earneth him the daily bread;
And studiously the humbler for that pride,
Professedly the faultier that he knows
God's secret, while he holds the thread of life.
Indeed the especial marking of the man
Is prone submission to the heavenly will--
Seeing it, what it is, and why it is.
'Sayeth, he will wait patient to the last
For that same death, which must restore his being
To equilibrium, body loosening soul
Divorced even now by premature full growth:
He will live, nay, it pleaseth him to live
So long as God please, and just how God please.
He even seeketh not to please God more
(Which meaneth, otherwise) than as God please.
Hence, I perceive not he affects to preach
The doctrine of his sect whate'er it be,
Make proselytes as madmen thirst to do:
How can he give his neighbour the real ground,
His own conviction? Ardent as he is--
Call his great truth a lie, why, still the old
"Be it as God please" reassureth him.
I probed the sore as thy disciple should:
"How, beast," said I, "this stolid carelessness
Sufficeth thee, when Rome is on her march
To stamp out like a little spark thy town,
Thy tribe, thy crazy tale and thee at once?"
He merely looked with his large eyes on me,
The man is apathetic, you deduce?
Contrariwise, he loves both old and young,
Able and weak, affects the very brutes
And birds--how say I? flowers of the field--
As a wise workman recognizes tools
In a master's workshop, loving what they make.
Thus is the man as harmless as a lamb:
Only impatient, let him do his best,
At ignorance and carelessness and sin--
An indignation which is promptly curbed:
As when in certain travel I have feigned
To be an ignoramus in our art
According to some preconceived design,
And happed to hear the land's practitioners
Steeped in conceit sublimed by ignorance,
Prattle fantastically on disease,
Its cause and cure--and I must hold my peace!

Thou wilt object--Why have I not ere this
Sought out the sage himself, the Nazarene
Who wrought this cure, inquiring at the source,
Conferring with the frankness that befits?
Alas! it grieveth me, the learned leech
Perished in a tumult many years ago,
Accused--our learning's fate--of wizardry,
Rebellion, to the setting up a rule
And creed prodigious as described to me.
His death, which happened when the earthquake fell
(Prefiguring, as soon appeared, the loss
To occult learning in our lord the sage
Who lived there in the pyramid alone),
Was wrought by the mad people--that's their wont!
On vain recourse, as I conjecture it.
To his tried virtue, for miraculous help--
How could he stop the earthquake? That's their way!
The other imputations must be lies:
But take one, tho' I loathe to give it thee,
In mere respect for any good man's fame.
(And after all, our patient Lazarus
Is stark mad; should we count on what he says?
Perhaps not: tho' in writing to a leech
'Tis well to keep back nothing of a case.)
This man so cured regards the curer, then,
As--God forgive me! who but God Himself,
Creator and sustainer of the world,
That came and dwelt in flesh on it awhile.
--'Sayeth that such an one was born, and lived,
Taught, healed the sick, broke bread at his own house,
Then died; with Lazarus by, for aught I know,
And yet was ... what I said nor choose repeat,
And must have so avouched himself, in fact,
In hearing of this very Lazarus
Who saith--but why all this of what he saith?
Why write of trivial matters, things of price
Calling at every moment for remark?
I noticed on the margin of a pool
Blue-flowering borage, the Aleppo sort,
Aboundeth, very nitrous. It is strange!

Thy pardon for this long and tedious case,
Which, now that I review it, needs must seem
Unduly dwelt on, prolixly set forth!
Nor I myself discern in what is writ
Good cause for the peculiar interest
And awe indeed this man has touched me with.
Perhaps the journey's end, the weariness
Had wrought upon me first. I met him thus:
I crossed a ridge of short sharp broken hills
Like an old lion's cheek teeth. Out there came
A moon made like a face with certain spots
Multiform, manifold, and menacing:
Then a wind rose behind me. So we met
In this old sleepy town at unaware,
The man and I. I send thee what is writ.
Regard it as a chance, a matter risked
To this ambiguous Syrian: he may lose,
Or steal, or give it thee with equal good.
Jerusalem's repose shall make amends
For time this letter wastes, thy time and mine;
Till when, once more thy pardon and farewell!

The very God! think, Abib; dost thou think?
So, the All-Great, were the All-Loving too--
So, through the thunder comes a human voice
Saying, "O heart I made, a heart beats here!
Face, my hands fashioned, see it in myself!
Thou hast no power nor mayst conceive of mine,
But love I gave thee, with myself to love,
And thou must love me who have died for thee!"
The madman saith He said so; it is strange.

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "An Epistle: Containing the Strange Medical Experience of Karshish, the Arab Physician" by Robert Browning is written in the form of a dramatic monologue, where Karshish, the Arab physician, narrates his experiences and observations in a letter to Abib. The poem is structured as a series of stanzas, each containing a specific part of Karshish's story and reflections. The poem does not adhere to a strict meter or rhyme scheme, allowing Browning to convey Karshish's thoughts and experiences in a natural and conversational tone. The lack of a consistent rhyme scheme and meter adds to the realism and authenticity of Karshish's voice, making the narrative more engaging and believable.

### Themes and Imagery

One of the central themes of the poem is the exploration of faith, belief, and the intersection of science and spirituality. Karshish grapples with the miraculous healing of a man, Lazarus, by a Nazarene physician, which challenges his rational understanding as a physician. The imagery in the poem is vivid and evocative, with descriptions of Karshish's journey, encounters with robbers, and observations of nature adding depth to the narrative. The imagery of the moon, wind, and landscape reflects the internal turmoil and external challenges faced by Karshish as he navigates his beliefs and experiences.

### Literary Devices

Browning employs various literary devices in the poem to enhance its meaning and impact. One notable device is the use of allusion, as Karshish references biblical figures such as Lazarus and the Nazarene physician. The poem also features imagery, metaphor, and symbolism, such as the blue-flowering borage symbolizing the unexpected and the unknown. Browning's use of dialogue and characterization through Karshish's voice creates a sense of intimacy and authenticity, drawing the reader into the narrative.

### Historical and Personal Context

Browning's own background in literature and his fascination with psychology likely influenced the themes and characters in the poem, showcasing his ability to blend intellectual inquiry with emotional depth.

### Deep Reading

In delving deeper into the poem, it becomes evident that Karshish's narrative serves as a metaphor for the struggle between reason and faith, science and spirituality. Karshish's skepticism as a physician is challenged by the inexplicable healing of Lazarus, leading him to question the boundaries of his knowledge and beliefs. The poem raises profound questions about the nature of truth, perception, and the limitations of human understanding. By juxtaposing Karshish's rational observations with the mystical elements of Lazarus's healing, Browning invites readers to contemplate the complexities of faith and the mysteries of existence. Ultimately, "An Epistle" offers a rich tapestry of themes and ideas that resonate beyond its historical context, inviting readers to ponder the enduring enigmas of life, death, and the human experience.

## Insensibility by Wilfred Owen

```
I

Happy are men who yet before they are killed
Can let their veins run cold.
Whom no compassion fleers
Or makes their feet
Sore on the alleys cobbled with their brothers.
The front line withers,
But they are troops who fade, not flowers
For poets' tearful fooling:
Men, gaps for filling
Losses who might have fought
Longer; but no one bothers.


    II

And some cease feeling
Even themselves or for themselves.
Dullness best solves
The tease and doubt of shelling,
And Chance's strange arithmetic
Comes simpler than the reckoning of their shilling.
They keep no check on Armies' decimation.


    III

Happy are these who lose imagination:
They have enough to carry with ammunition.
Their spirit drags no pack.
Their old wounds save with cold can not more ache.
Having seen all things red,
Their eyes are rid
Of the hurt of the colour of blood for ever.
And terror's first constriction over,
Their hearts remain small drawn.
Their senses in some scorching cautery of battle
Now long since ironed,
Can laugh among the dying, unconcerned.


    IV

Happy the soldier home, with not a notion
How somewhere, every dawn, some men attack,
And many sighs are drained.
Happy the lad whose mind was never trained:
His days are worth forgetting more than not.
He sings along the march
Which we march taciturn, because of dusk,
The long, forlorn, relentless trend
From larger day to huger night.


    V

We wise, who with a thought besmirch
Blood over all our soul,
How should we see our task
But through his blunt and lashless eyes?
Alive, he is not vital overmuch;
Dying, not mortal overmuch;
Nor sad, nor proud,
Nor curious at all.
He cannot tell
Old men's placidity from his.


    VI

But cursed are dullards whom no cannon stuns,
That they should be as stones.
Wretched are they, and mean
With paucity that never was simplicity.
By choice they made themselves immune
To pity and whatever mourns in man
Before the last sea and the hapless stars;
Whatever mourns when many leave these shores;
Whatever shares
The eternal reciprocity of tears.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "Insensibility" by Wilfred Owen is structured into six stanzas, each varying in length. The poem does not adhere to a specific rhyme scheme, contributing to the overall sense of dissonance and lack of harmony, which mirrors the bleak and desensitized theme of the poem. The irregular structure and lack of rhyme scheme reflect the chaotic and disjointed nature of war, emphasizing the sense of disconnection and desensitization experienced by the soldiers. 

Owen's use of enjambment, where a sentence or phrase runs over multiple lines, adds to the sense of continuous movement and lack of closure, mirroring the relentless and unending nature of war. The poem's lack of consistent meter also adds to the feeling of unease and discomfort, creating a sense of discordance that reflects the harsh realities of war.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of "Insensibility" revolves around the desensitization and emotional numbness experienced by soldiers in the face of war. Owen explores the idea that in order to survive the horrors of war, soldiers must become emotionally detached and suppress their feelings. The imagery in the poem is stark and vivid, depicting the physical and emotional toll of war on the soldiers. Owen uses powerful visual imagery, such as "alleys cobbled with their brothers" and "scorching cautery of battle," to convey the brutal and dehumanizing nature of war.

The poem also explores the idea of the loss of imagination and empathy as a coping mechanism for soldiers. Owen suggests that in order to endure the atrocities of war, soldiers must lose their ability to feel and imagine, becoming numb to the suffering around them. The imagery of soldiers laughing among the dying highlights the profound emotional detachment and desensitization experienced by those in the midst of battle.

### Literary Devices

Owen employs various literary devices throughout the poem to convey the theme of desensitization and emotional numbness. The use of paradox, such as in the line "Happy are these who lose imagination," serves to highlight the contradictory nature of finding happiness in the loss of empathy and emotion. Owen also uses irony, particularly in the depiction of soldiers as "happy" despite their emotional detachment and loss of humanity.

The poet utilizes vivid imagery to evoke the physical and emotional realities of war, such as "shelling," "decimation," and "tease and doubt." These images serve to create a sense of the harsh and brutal conditions faced by soldiers on the front lines. Owen's use of personification, such as referring to compassion "fleering" and Chance's arithmetic "coming simpler," adds depth and complexity to the poem, giving a voice and agency to abstract concepts.

### Historical and Personal Context

Wilfred Owen was a British poet and soldier who served in World War I, and his firsthand experiences of the horrors of war heavily influenced his poetry. "Insensibility" reflects Owen's disillusionment with the glorification of war and his condemnation of the emotional toll it takes on soldiers. The poem speaks to the dehumanizing effects of war and the psychological trauma experienced by those who are forced to endure its brutality.

During World War I, soldiers faced unimaginable hardships and witnessed unspeakable atrocities, leading to a sense of emotional numbness and detachment as a means of survival. Owen's personal experiences on the front lines inform the raw and visceral imagery present in the poem, capturing the devastating impact of war on the human psyche.

### Deep Reading

Through "Insensibility," Owen delves deep into the psychological and emotional effects of war, challenging traditional notions of heroism and sacrifice. The poem serves as a powerful critique of the dehumanizing nature of war and the toll it takes on individuals who are forced to confront unimaginable horrors. Owen's exploration of emotional numbness and desensitization highlights the profound loss of humanity that occurs in the face of violence and suffering.

The poem forces readers to confront the harsh realities of war and consider the ethical and moral implications of conflict. Owen's vivid imagery and evocative language create a haunting portrait of the emotional devastation wrought by war, urging us to reflect on the true cost of violence and destruction. "Insensibility" serves as a poignant reminder of the enduring impact of war on the human spirit, challenging us to question the nature of sacrifice and the price of silence in the face of injustice.

## Today's Writing Challenge

**Form:** Villanelle

**Structure:** A 19-line poem with five tercets followed by a quatrain. The first and third lines of the first tercet are alternately repeated as the final lines of the following tercets, then both repeated at the end of the quatrain.

**Rhyme Scheme:** ABA ABA ABA ABA ABA ABAA

*Prompt: Write a Villanelle exploring the bittersweet nostalgia of revisiting a childhood home after many years. Capture the sensory details of familiar sights, sounds, and smells that evoke memories of youth, while also acknowledging the passage of time and the changes that have taken place.*

### Word Suggestions

Consider these word pairs that complement your poem's tone:

- **height** (Germanic) / **altitude** (Latinate)
  - *Both 'height' and 'altitude' convey a sense of elevation, but 'height' has a more grounded and familiar feel, while 'altitude' adds a touch of formality and distance. 'Height' may evoke childhood memories more directly, while 'altitude' introduces a slightly detached perspective.*
  - **Recommended:** Use the germanic version to enhance your poem's tone

- **year** (Germanic) / **annual** (Latinate)
  - *'Year' is a simple and straightforward term for a unit of time, while 'annual' implies a recurring event or something that happens once a year. 'Year' may better evoke the passage of time in a personal context, while 'annual' could introduce a more structured and cyclical sense of time.*
  - **Recommended:** Use the germanic version to enhance your poem's tone

- **belly** (Germanic) / **abdomen** (Latinate)
  - *Both 'belly' and 'abdomen' refer to the stomach area, but 'belly' is more colloquial and warm, while 'abdomen' is clinical and formal. 'Belly' carries a sense of familiarity and comfort, while 'abdomen' introduces a more detached and perhaps medical tone.*
  - **Recommended:** Use the germanic version to enhance your poem's tone
