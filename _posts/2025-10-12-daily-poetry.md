## Stars by Emily Bronte

```
Ah! why, because the dazzling sun
Restored our Earth to joy,
Have you departed, every one,
And left a desert sky?

All through the night, your glorious eyes
Were gazing down in mine,
And, with a full heart's thankful sighs,
I blessed that watch divine.

I was at peace, and drank your beams
As they were life to me;
And revelled in my changeful dreams,
Like petrel on the sea.

Thought followed thought, star followed star
Through boundless regions on;
While one sweet influence, near and far,
Thrilled through, and proved us one!

Why did the morning dawn to break
So great, so pure a spell;
And scorch with fire the tranquil cheek,
Where your cool radiance fell?

Blood-red, he rose, and arrow-straight,
His fierce beams struck my brow;
The soul of nature sprang, elate,
But mine sank sad and low.

My lids closed down, yet through their veil
I saw him, blazinig, still,
And steep in gold the misty dale,
And flash upon the hill.

I turned me to the pillow, then,
To call back night, and see
Your words of solemn light, again,
Throb with my heart, and me!

It would not do - the pillow glowed,
And glowed both roof and floor;
And birds sang loudly in the wood,
And fresh winds shook the door;

The curtains waved, the wakened flies
Were murmuring round my room,
Imprisoned there, till I should rise,
And give them leave to roam.

O stars, and dreams, and gentle night;
O night and stars, return!
And hide me from the hostile light
That does not warm, but burn;

That drains the blood of suffering men;
Drinks tears, instead of dew;
Let me sleep through his blinding reign,
And only wake with you!
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

Emily Bronte's poem "Stars" consists of five stanzas, each with a varying number of lines. The first stanza has four lines, the second and third stanzas have nine lines each, the fourth stanza has eight lines, and the final stanza has seven lines. The irregular stanza lengths contribute to the poem's conversational and emotive tone, allowing Bronte to explore the speaker's feelings of longing and disappointment.

The poem does not strictly adhere to a specific meter, but it flows smoothly with a mix of iambic and trochaic rhythms. This varied meter mirrors the speaker's shifting emotions as they contemplate the absence of the stars and the longing for their return.

In terms of rhyme scheme, the poem follows an ABAB pattern in the first stanza, transitioning to a more varied rhyme scheme in the subsequent stanzas. This variation in rhyme scheme adds to the poem's organic and introspective feel, reflecting the speaker's inner turmoil and yearning.

### Themes and Imagery

One of the central themes in "Stars" is the contrast between the beauty and comfort of the night sky filled with stars and the harsh reality of the morning sun that disrupts this tranquility. Bronte uses vivid imagery of the stars as symbols of peace, unity, and connection. The speaker finds solace in the stars, describing them as "glorious eyes" that watch over them and provide a sense of oneness with the universe.

The imagery of the morning sun, on the other hand, is portrayed as harsh, scorching, and disruptive. The speaker laments the loss of the stars and yearns for the return of the gentle night that shields them from the hostile light of day. This contrast between the comforting darkness of night and the harsh light of day underscores the speaker's desire for escape and refuge.

### Literary Devices

Bronte employs various literary devices to convey the speaker's emotions and the themes of the poem. One notable device is personification, as the stars are described as having "glorious eyes" and the morning sun is depicted as rising "blood-red" with "fierce beams." These personifications give the celestial bodies human-like qualities and emphasize their significance in the speaker's emotional landscape.

The poem also contains vivid imagery, such as the stars gazing down "in mine" and the morning sun striking the speaker's brow with "fierce beams." This imagery creates a sensory experience for the reader and evokes the speaker's intense feelings of loss and longing.

Additionally, Bronte uses symbolism, with the stars representing peace, unity, and transcendence, while the morning sun symbolizes disruption, harsh reality, and discomfort. The contrast between these symbols adds depth to the poem and conveys the speaker's emotional turmoil.

### Historical and Personal Context

Emily Bronte, known for her introspective and emotive poetry, wrote "Stars" during a period of personal hardship and isolation. The poem reflects Bronte's own struggles with loss, loneliness, and longing for connection. Bronte's experiences of grief and longing likely influenced the emotional depth and introspective nature of the poem.

The Victorian era, during which Bronte lived, was marked by significant social and technological changes, as well as a growing interest in individual emotions and experiences. Bronte's exploration of themes such as solitude, nature, and the transcendent power of the stars reflects the broader cultural and intellectual currents of her time.

### Deep Reading

"Stars" can be interpreted as a meditation on the transient nature of happiness and the fleeting moments of solace that can be found in the beauty of the natural world. The speaker's longing for the return of the stars and the night sky suggests a desire for connection, unity, and transcendence in the face of a harsh and unforgiving reality.

The poem's shifting imagery from the peaceful night to the harsh morning highlights the speaker's internal conflict between the desire for escape and the inevitability of facing reality. Ultimately, "Stars" can be seen as a poignant reflection on the human experience of seeking solace and connection in moments of darkness and uncertainty.

## Encouragement by Paul Laurence Dunbar

Cain't you tell me how I look?
Speak up, Ike, an' 'spress yo'se'f.

Ef de man I wants 'ud speak.

But dey would n't ekal mine.

I's had offers; some ain't quit;
But I has n't ma'ied yit!
Speak up, Ike, an' 'spress yo'se'f.

Ike, I loves you,--yes, I does;
You's my choice, and allus was.
Laffin' at you ain't no harm.--

Was n't you a awful sight,
Havin' me to baig you so?
Now ax whut you want to know,--
Speak up, Ike, an' 'spress yo'se'f!
