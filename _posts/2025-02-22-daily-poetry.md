## A Better Ressurection by Christina Rossetti

```
I have no wit, no words, no tears;
My heart within me like a stone
Is numbed too much for hopes or fears.
Look right, look left, I dwell alone;
I lift mine eyes, but dimmed with grief
No everlasting hills I see;
My life is in the falling leaf:
O Jesus, quicken me.

My life is like a faded leaf,
My harvest dwindled to a husk:
Truly my life is void and brief
And tedious in the barren dusk;
My life is like a frozen thing,
No bud nor greenness can I see:
Yet rise it shall--the sap of spring;
O Jesus, rise in me.

My life is like a broken bowl,
A broken bowl that cannot hold
One drop of water for my soul
Or cordial in the searching cold;
Cast in the fire the perished thing;
Melt and remould it, till it be
A royal cup for Him, my King:
O Jesus, drink of me.
```

## Sympathy by Paul Laurence Dunbar

```
I know what the caged bird feels, alas!
When the sun is bright on the upland slopes;
When the wind stirs soft through the springing grass,
And the river flows like a stream of glass;
When the first bird sings and the first bud opes,
And the faint perfume from its chalice steals--
I know what the caged bird feels!

I know why the caged bird beats his wing
Till its blood is red on the cruel bars;
For he must fly back to his perch and cling
When he fain would be on the bough a-swing;
And a pain still throbs in the old, old scars
And they pulse again with a keener sting--
I know why he beats his wing!

I know why the caged bird sings, ah me,
When his wing is bruised and his bosom sore,--
When he beats his bars and he would be free;
It is not a carol of joy or glee,
But a prayer that he sends from his heart's deep core,
But a plea, that upward to Heaven he flings--
I know why the caged bird sings!
```

The use of consistent meter and rhyme scheme underscores the theme of confinement and repetition, mirroring the caged bird's constrained existence.

### Themes and Imagery

One of the central themes of "Sympathy" is confinement and the desire for freedom. This theme is vividly conveyed through the imagery of a caged bird yearning to soar freely in nature. The contrast between the bird's natural instincts and its restricted environment creates a poignant metaphor for the limitations and struggles faced by individuals in society. The imagery of the sun, wind, grass, river, and bird's wings symbolizes freedom, beauty, and longing, highlighting the bird's yearning for liberation.

Another key theme in the poem is suffering and resilience. The caged bird's physical and emotional pain is depicted through vivid descriptions of its bruised wings, sore bosom, and old scars. Despite its hardships, the bird continues to sing, expressing its innermost feelings and desires. This theme of resilience in the face of adversity resonates with the African American experience of enduring oppression and seeking liberation.

### Literary Devices

Dunbar employs several literary devices to enhance the emotional impact of the poem. One of the most prominent devices is personification, as the caged bird is given human-like qualities and emotions. By attributing thoughts and feelings to the bird, Dunbar invites readers to empathize with its plight and understand the universal longing for freedom.

The use of symbolism is also significant in the poem, with the caged bird symbolizing marginalized individuals who are constrained by societal barriers. The imagery of the bird beating its wings against the bars conveys a sense of defiance and resistance, highlighting the struggle for autonomy and self-expression.

Additionally, the repetition of the phrase "I know" throughout the poem emphasizes the speaker's empathy and understanding of the caged bird's suffering. This repetition reinforces the theme of solidarity and shared experience, creating a sense of connection between the speaker and the bird.

The caged bird serves as a powerful metaphor for the constraints imposed on African Americans during this period, highlighting their enduring struggle for freedom and equality.

Dunbar's use of dialect and vernacular language in his poetry also reflects his cultural background and identity as a black writer. By incorporating elements of African American speech and storytelling traditions, Dunbar sought to celebrate the richness and complexity of African American culture while challenging stereotypes and prejudices.

### Deep Reading

At its core, "Sympathy" is a deeply moving and evocative poem that speaks to the universal human desire for freedom and self-expression. Through the poignant imagery of the caged bird, Dunbar confronts the harsh realities of oppression and confinement while celebrating the resilience and spirit of those who endure suffering with dignity and grace.

The poem's emotional depth and profound insight into the human condition make it a timeless work that continues to resonate with readers today. By exploring themes of confinement, suffering, and resilience, Dunbar invites us to reflect on our own struggles and aspirations, prompting us to empathize with those who are marginalized and oppressed. "Sympathy" serves as a poignant reminder of the enduring power of poetry to illuminate the complexities of the human experience and inspire empathy and understanding.

## Moonlight, summer moonlight by Emily Bronte

```
'Tis moonlight, summer moonlight,
All soft and still and fair;
The solemn hour of midnight
Breathes sweet thoughts everywhere,

But most where trees are sending
Their breezy boughs on high,
Or stooping low are lending
A shelter from the sky.

And there in those wild bowers
A lovely form is laid;
Green grass and dew-steeped flowers
Wave gently round her head.
```
