## Spring Offensive by Wilfred Owen

```
Halted against the shade of a last hill,
They fed, and, lying easy, were at ease
And, finding comfortable chests and knees
Carelessly slept.  But many there stood still
To face the stark, blank sky beyond the ridge,
Knowing their feet had come to the end of the world.

Marvelling they stood, and watched the long grass swirled
By the May breeze, murmurous with wasp and midge,
For though the summer oozed into their veins
Like the injected drug for their bones' pains,
Sharp on their souls hung the imminent line of grass,
Fearfully flashed the sky's mysterious glass.

Hour after hour they ponder the warm field --
And the far valley behind, where the buttercups
Had blessed with gold their slow boots coming up,
Where even the little brambles would not yield,
But clutched and clung to them like sorrowing hands;
They breathe like trees unstirred.

Till like a cold gust thrilled the little word
At which each body and its soul begird
And tighten them for battle.  No alarms
Of bugles, no high flags, no clamorous haste --
Only a lift and flare of eyes that faced
The sun, like a friend with whom their love is done.
O larger shone that smile against the sun, --
Mightier than his whose bounty these have spurned.

So, soon they topped the hill, and raced together
Over an open stretch of herb and heather
Exposed.  And instantly the whole sky burned
With fury against them; and soft sudden cups
Opened in thousands for their blood; and the green slopes
Chasmed and steepened sheer to infinite space.

Of them who running on that last high place
Leapt to swift unseen bullets, or went up
On the hot blast and fury of hell's upsurge,
Or plunged and fell away past this world's verge,
Some say God caught them even before they fell.

But what say such as from existence' brink
Ventured but drave too swift to sink.
The few who rushed in the body to enter hell,
And there out-fiending all its fiends and flames
With superhuman inhumanities,
Long-famous glories, immemorial shames --
And crawling slowly back, have by degrees
Regained cool peaceful air in wonder --
Why speak they not of comrades that went under?
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

In "Spring Offensive," Wilfred Owen utilizes a traditional sonnet form with 14 lines, adhering to the typical structure of a Petrarchan sonnet with an octet followed by a sestet. The poem is written in iambic pentameter, creating a rhythmic flow that mirrors the soldiers' movements and emotions. The rhyme scheme is ABBAABBA CDCDCD, which is common in Petrarchan sonnets. This structured form contrasts with the chaotic and brutal subject matter of the poem, highlighting the tension between the beauty of nature and the horror of war.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of "Spring Offensive" is the juxtaposition of the natural world with the brutality of war. Owen vividly describes the beauty of nature in springtime - the long grass swirled by the May breeze, the golden buttercups in the far valley, and the peaceful air that the soldiers long to regain. This imagery serves to emphasize the stark contrast between the tranquility of the environment and the violence of the battlefield. The poem explores the disillusionment and loss of innocence experienced by the soldiers as they face the harsh realities of war.

### Literary Devices

Owen employs various literary devices to convey the themes of the poem. One striking device is personification, as nature is anthropomorphized to reflect the soldiers' emotions and experiences. For example, the grass is described as having an "imminent line" that hangs sharp on the soldiers' souls, and the sky's mysterious glass fearfully flashes. These personifications create a sense of foreboding and unease. Additionally, Owen uses vivid imagery to evoke the sensory experiences of the soldiers, such as the soft sudden cups opening for their blood and the green slopes chasmed and steepened sheer to infinite space, heightening the intensity of the battlefield.

### Historical and Personal Context

Wilfred Owen was a soldier in World War I, and his poetry is deeply influenced by his firsthand experience of the horrors of war. "Spring Offensive" reflects Owen's disillusionment with the glorification of war and his belief in the futility of conflict. The poem captures the psychological impact of warfare on soldiers, portraying their fear, confusion, and sense of betrayal. Owen's poems are a powerful critique of the romanticized notions of heroism and sacrifice associated with war, shedding light on the harsh realities faced by those on the front lines.

### Deep Reading

"Spring Offensive" delves into the internal conflict faced by soldiers as they confront the brutality of war amidst the beauty of nature. The poem explores the paradox of finding comfort and peace in the midst of chaos and violence. The soldiers are torn between the allure of the natural world and the harsh reality of their situation, symbolized by the sun, which they face like a friend with whom their love is done. The final lines suggest a sense of survivor's guilt and the haunting memories of those who did not make it back, questioning why some soldiers choose to remain silent about their fallen comrades. Overall, "Spring Offensive" is a poignant reflection on the devastating impact of war on individuals and the collective psyche of a generation.

## Mid-ocean in War-time by Joyce Kilmer

```
(For My Mother)

The fragile splendour of the level sea,
The moon's serene and silver-veiled face,
Make of this vessel an enchanted place
Full of white mirth and golden sorcery.
Now, for a time, shall careless laughter be
Blended with song, to lend song sweeter grace,
And the old stars, in their unending race,
Shall heed and envy young humanity.
And yet to-night, a hundred leagues away,
These waters blush a strange and awful red.
Before the moon, a cloud obscenely grey
Rises from decks that crash with flying lead.
And these stars smile their immemorial way
On waves that shroud a thousand newly dead!
```

## Death by Emily Bronte

```
Death! that struck when I was most confiding
In my certain faith of joy to be -
Strike again, Time's withered branch dividing
From the fresh root of Eternity!

Leaves, upon Time's branch, were growing brightly,
Full of sap, and full of silver dew;
Birds beneath its shelter gathered nightly;
Daily round its flowers the wild bees flew.

Sorrow passed, and plucked the golden blossom;
Guilt stripped off the foliage in its pride;
But, within its parent's kindly bosom,
Flowed for ever Life's restoring-tide.

Little mourned I for the parted gladness,
For the vacant nest and silent song -
Hope was there, and laughed me out of sadness;
Whispering, " Winter will not linger long!"

And, behold! with tenfold increase blessing,
Spring adorned the beauty-burdened spray;
Wind and rain and fervent heat, caressing,
Lavished glory on that second May!

High it rose - no winged grief could sweep it;
Sin was scared to distance with its shine;
Love, and its own life, had power to keep it
From all wrong - from every blight but thine!

Cruel Death! The young leaves droop and languish;
Evening's gentle air may still restore -
No! the morning sunshine mocks my anguish -
Time, for me, must never blossom more!

Strike it down, that other boughs may flourish
Where that perished sapling used to be;
Thus, at least, its mouldering corpse will nourish
That from which it sprung - Eternity.
```

**Structure:** No set meter or rhyme scheme, allowing for freedom in line length and structure.

**Rhyme Scheme:** None

*Prompt: Write a poem that captures the sensation of diving into a cold mountain lake on a hot summer day, exploring the contrast between the shock of the cold water and the warmth of the sun above.*

### Word Suggestions

Consider these word pairs that complement your poem's tone:

- **cold** (Germanic) / **frigid** (Latinate)
  - *The word 'cold' is straightforward and commonly used, conveying a sense of low temperature. On the other hand, 'frigid' carries a more intense and almost harsh connotation, emphasizing the extreme coldness of the mountain lake. 'Frigid' adds a layer of severity and starkness to the sensation of diving into the water.*
  - **Recommended:** Use the latinate version to enhance your poem's tone

- **warmth** (Germanic) / **heat** (Latinate)
  - *'Warmth' suggests a gentle and comforting feeling of heat, while 'heat' conveys a more intense and sometimes oppressive form of warmth. In the context of the poem, 'heat' would emphasize the scorching nature of the sun and create a stark contrast with the cold mountain lake, intensifying the sensory experience.*
  - **Recommended:** Use the latinate version to enhance your poem's tone

- **shock** (Germanic) / **surprise** (Latinate)
  - *While 'shock' implies a sudden and intense reaction to the cold water, 'surprise' conveys a more unexpected and perhaps lighter feeling. 'Shock' captures the immediate and almost jarring impact of the cold, while 'surprise' may soften the contrast between the elements. Therefore, 'shock' better aligns with the prompt's tone and the poem's focus on contrasting sensations.*
  - **Recommended:** Use the germanic version to enhance your poem's tone
