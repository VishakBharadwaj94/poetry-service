## Why I am a Liberal by Robert Browning

```
"Why?" Because all I haply can and do,
  All that I am now, all I hope to be,--
  Whence comes it save from fortune setting free
Body and soul the purpose to pursue,
God traced for both? If fetters, not a few,
  Of prejudice, convention, fall from me,
  These shall I bid men--each in his degree
Also God-guided--bear, and gayly too?
  But little do or can the best of us:
That little is achieved thro' Liberty.
  Who then dares hold, emancipated thus,
His fellow shall continue bound? not I,
  Who live, love, labour freely, nor discuss
A brother's right to freedom. That is "Why."
```

## To One In Paradise by Edgar Allan Poe

```
Thou wast that all to me, love,
  For which my soul did pine--
A green isle in the sea, love,
  A fountain and a shrine,
All wreathed with fairy fruits and flowers,
And all the flowers were mine.

Ah, dream too bright to last!
  Ah, starry Hope! that didst arise
But to be overcast!
  A voice from out the Future cries,
"On! on!"--but o'er the Past
  (Dim gulf!) my spirit hovering lies
Mute, motionless, aghast!

For, alas! alas! with me
  The light of Life is o'er!
"No more--no more--no more"--
(Such language holds the solemn sea
  To the sands upon the shore)
Shall bloom the thunder-blasted tree,
  Or the stricken eagle soar!

And all my days are trances,
  And all my nightly dreams
Are where thy dark eye glances,
  And where thy footstep gleams--
In what ethereal dances,
  By what eternal streams!

Alas! for that accursed time
  They bore thee o'er the billow,
From love to titled age and crime,
  And an unholy pillow!
From me, and from our misty clime,
  Where weeps the silver willow!
```

## Fragment: A Tale Untold by Percy Bysshe Shelley

```
One sung of thee who left the tale untold,
Like the false dawns which perish in the bursting;
Like empty cups of wrought and daedal gold,
Which mock the lips with air, when they are thirsting.
```

The use of vivid imagery, such as "empty cups" and "false dawns," evokes a feeling of emptiness and disillusionment.

### Literary Devices

Additionally, the personification of "false dawns" and "empty cups" imbues these objects with a sense of agency, highlighting their role in deceiving and disappointing.

### Historical and Personal Context
As a Romantic poet, Shelley often explored themes of beauty, nature, and the human experience in his works. The idea of unfulfilled potential and lost opportunities would have resonated with Shelley's own personal struggles and the tumultuous events of his time.

Ultimately, Shelley's poem encourages readers to reflect on the significance of the tales we leave untold and the impact of unfulfilled potential on our lives.

## Today's Writing Challenge

**Form:** Terza Rima

**Structure:** Terza Rima consists of tercets (three-line stanzas) in iambic pentameter, where the middle line of each stanza rhymes with the first and third lines of the next stanza.

**Rhyme Scheme:** ABA, BCB, CDC, etc.

*Prompt: Write a poem that captures the sensation of a summer storm approaching, using vivid imagery to convey the anticipation, energy, and release of the storm's arrival.*

### Word Suggestions

Consider these word pairs that complement your poem's tone:

- **wind** (Germanic) / **ventilation** (Latinate)
  - *The word 'wind' carries a more natural and elemental connotation, emphasizing the raw power and unpredictability of nature. On the other hand, 'ventilation' has a more technical and controlled feel, focusing on the process of air circulation. For the poem's tone of anticipation and energy, 'wind' would work better to evoke the primal force of the approaching storm.*
  - **Recommended:** Use the germanic version to enhance your poem's tone

- **fast** (Germanic) / **rapid** (Latinate)
  - *'Fast' is a straightforward and direct word that conveys speed and urgency without embellishment. In contrast, 'rapid' has a slightly more formal and clinical tone, emphasizing swiftness in a more structured manner. Considering the poem's themes of nature's power and beauty, 'fast' would be more fitting to capture the intense energy and movement of the storm's approach.*
  - **Recommended:** Use the germanic version to enhance your poem's tone

- **foe** (Germanic) / **enemy** (Latinate)
  - *While both words refer to an adversary, 'foe' has a more archaic and poetic quality, invoking a sense of conflict or opposition in a literary context. 'Enemy', on the other hand, is a more common and direct term used in everyday language to denote someone hostile or opposed. Given the poem's focus on the awe-inspiring beauty and power of nature, 'foe' would add a touch of poetic resonance and elegance, aligning well with the Terza Rima form and the anticipation of the storm's arrival.*
  - **Recommended:** Use the germanic version to enhance your poem's tone
