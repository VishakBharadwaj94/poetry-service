## Spirits Of The Dead by Edgar Allan Poe

```
Thy soul shall find itself alone
'Mid dark thoughts of the gray tombstone
Not one, of all the crowd, to pry
Into thine hour of secrecy.
Be silent in that solitude
  Which is not loneliness--for then
The spirits of the dead who stood
  In life before thee are again
In death around thee--and their will
Shall overshadow thee: be still.
The night--tho' clear--shall frown--
And the stars shall not look down
From their high thrones in the Heaven,
With light like Hope to mortals given--
But their red orbs, without beam,
To thy weariness shall seem
As a burning and a fever
Which would cling to thee forever.
Now are thoughts thou shalt not banish--
Now are visions ne'er to vanish--
From thy spirit shall they pass
No more--like dew-drops from the grass.
The breeze--the breath of God--is still--
And the mist upon the hill
Shadowy--shadowy--yet unbroken,
  Is a symbol and a token--
  How it hangs upon the trees,
  A mystery of mysteries!
```

## A Little Budding Rose by Emily Bronte

```
It was a little budding rose,
Round like a fairy globe,
And shyly did its leaves unclose
Hid in their mossy robe,
But sweet was the slight and spicy smell
It breathed from its heart invisible.

The rose is blasted, withered, blighted,
Its root has felt a worm,
And like a heart beloved and slighted,
Failed, faded, shrunk its form.
Bud of beauty, bonnie flower,
I stole thee from thy natal bower.

I was the worm that withered thee,
Thy tears of dew all fell for me;
Leaf and stalk and rose are gone,
Exile earth they died upon.
Yes, that last breath of balmy scent
With alien breezes sadly blent!
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

### Themes and Imagery

One of the central themes of the poem is the fragility and transience of beauty. The imagery of the budding rose, described as "Round like a fairy globe" with "leaves unclose / Hid in their mossy robe," symbolizes innocence and vulnerability.

The imagery of the withered rose, "blasted, withered, blighted," conveys a sense of sadness and mortality.

### Literary Devices

Bronte employs various literary devices to enhance the emotional impact of the poem. The personification of the rose, describing it as having a "heart invisible" and feeling emotions such as being "beloved and slighted," adds depth to the imagery. The use of metaphor is also evident in lines such as "I was the worm that withered thee," where the speaker compares themselves to a destructive force. Additionally, the repetition of the word "rose" throughout the poem emphasizes the central symbol and reinforces the theme of beauty and decay.

### Historical and Personal Context

Emily Bronte, known for her introspective and emotive poetry, often explored themes of nature, mortality, and the passage of time in her works. As a member of the Romantic literary movement, Bronte's writing often focused on the individual's emotional experience and connection to the natural world. The imagery of the rose in "A Little Budding Rose" reflects Bronte's own preoccupation with the fleeting nature of beauty and the inevitability of loss.

### Deep Reading

Through the metaphor of the rose, Bronte delves into the complexities of human relationships and emotions. The speaker's confession of being the "worm that withered thee" suggests feelings of guilt and regret for causing harm to something beautiful and innocent. This introspective exploration of culpability and remorse adds a layer of emotional depth to the poem. The final lines, with the image of the rose's scent blending with "alien breezes sadly," evoke a sense of displacement and longing, emphasizing the theme of loss and alienation.

In conclusion, "A Little Budding Rose" by Emily Bronte is a poignant reflection on the ephemeral nature of beauty and the emotional consequences of its decay. Through evocative imagery, skillful use of literary devices, and personal introspection, Bronte crafts a deeply moving exploration of human fragility and the passage of time.

## The Little Dog's Day by Rupert Brooke

```
All in the town were still asleep,
When the sun came up with a shout and a leap.
In the lonely streets unseen by man,
A little dog danced. And the day began.

All his life he'd been good, as far as he could,
And the poor little beast had done all that he should.
But this morning he swore, by Odin and Thor
And the Canine Valhalla—he'd stand it no more!

So his prayer he got granted—to do just what he wanted,
Prevented by none, for the space of one day.
"Jam incipiebo, sedere facebo,"
In dog-Latin he quoth, "Euge! sophos! hurray!"

He fought with the he-dogs, and winked at the she-dogs,
A thing that had never been heard of before.
"For the stigma of gluttony, I care not a button!" he
Cried, and ate all he could swallow—and more.

He took sinewy lumps from the shins of old frumps,
And mangled the errand-boys—when he could get 'em.
He shammed furious rabies, and bit all the babies,
And followed the cats up the trees, and then ate 'em!"

They thought 'twas the devil was holding a revel,
And sent for the parson to drive him away;
For the town never knew such a hullabaloo
As that little dog raised—till the end of that day.

When the blood-red sun had gone burning down,
And the lights were lit in the little town,
Outside, in the gloom of the twilight grey,
The little dog died when he'd had his day.
```
