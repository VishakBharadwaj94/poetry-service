## Before you thought of Spring by Emily Dickinson

```
Before you thought of Spring
Except as a Surmise
You see -- God bless his suddenness --
A Fellow in the Skies
Of independent Hues
A little weather worn
Inspiriting habiliments
Of Indigo and Brown --
With specimens of Song
As if for you to choose --
Discretion in the interval
With gay delays he goes
To some superior Tree
Without a single Leaf
And shouts for joy to Nobody
But his seraphic self --
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

In terms of form, Emily Dickinson's poem "Before you thought of Spring" consists of seven quatrains, each with a consistent ABCB rhyme scheme. The poem is written in iambic tetrameter, with lines alternating between four and three stresses. This creates a rhythmic flow that enhances the musicality of the poem.

The structure of the poem is fairly regular, with each quatrain presenting a distinct image or idea related to the arrival of spring. The consistent rhyme scheme and meter contribute to the overall coherence and fluidity of the poem.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem is the unexpected arrival of spring and the joy it brings. Through vivid imagery, Dickinson paints a picture of a mysterious figure in the sky, dressed in vibrant colors of "Indigo and Brown," and singing songs that seem tailored for the observer. This imagery evokes a sense of wonder and awe at the beauty and unpredictability of nature.

The poem also explores themes of independence and self-expression, as seen in the description of the figure shouting for joy to "Nobody but his seraphic self." This imagery conveys a sense of freedom and unbridled joy that comes with the arrival of spring.

### Literary Devices

Dickinson employs several literary devices in the poem to enhance its meaning and impact. One notable device is personification, as she attributes human-like qualities to nature, such as the figure in the sky with "habiliments" and "specimens of Song." This personification serves to deepen the reader's connection to nature and the changing seasons.

The poem also features imagery, with vivid descriptions of the colors and sounds associated with spring. The use of specific colors like "Indigo and Brown" and sensory details like songs and shouts immerses the reader in the scene and evokes a strong emotional response.

### Historical and Personal Context

Emily Dickinson, known for her unique style and introspective poetry, wrote this poem during the mid-19th century when she was living in seclusion in Amherst, Massachusetts. Her personal experiences of observing nature and reflecting on the passage of time likely influenced the themes and imagery present in the poem.

Historically, this period marked a time of rapid industrialization and urbanization, leading to a growing disconnect between humans and the natural world. Dickinson's celebration of spring and its unexpected beauty can be seen as a response to this changing landscape and a reminder of the importance of staying connected to the rhythms of nature.

### Deep Reading

On a deeper level, "Before you thought of Spring" can be interpreted as a meditation on the cyclical nature of life and the inevitability of change. The figure in the sky can be seen as a symbol of renewal and rebirth, bringing a sense of hope and joy after the long winter months. The act of shouting for joy to "Nobody but his seraphic self" suggests a pure, unselfconscious expression of happiness that transcends human concerns.

The poem invites readers to pause and appreciate the small moments of beauty and wonder that surround us, even in the midst of uncertainty and chaos. It serves as a gentle reminder to embrace the unexpected and find joy in the simple pleasures of life, much like the arrival of spring itself.

## Thanksgiving by Joyce Kilmer

```
(For John Bunker)

The roar of the world is in my ears.
Thank God for the roar of the world!
Thank God for the mighty tide of fears
Against me always hurled!
Thank God for the bitter and ceaseless strife,
And the sting of His chastening rod!
Thank God for the stress and the pain of life,
And Oh, thank God for God!
