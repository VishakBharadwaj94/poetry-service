## The Funeral of Youth: Threnody by Rupert Brooke

```
The Day that Youth had died,
There came to his grave-side,
In decent mourning, from the country’s ends,
Those scatter’d friends
Who had lived the boon companions of his prime,
And laughed with him and sung with him and wasted,
In feast and wine and many-crown’d carouse,
The days and nights and dawnings of the time
When Youth kept open house,
Nor left untasted
Aught of his high emprise and ventures dear,
No quest of his unshar’d—
All these, with loitering feet and sad head bar’d,
Followed their old friend’s bier.
Folly went first,
With muffled bells and coxcomb still revers’d;
And after trod the bearers, hat in hand—
Laughter, most hoarse, and Captain Pride with tanned
And martial face all grim, and fussy Joy
Who had to catch a train, and Lust, poor, snivelling boy;
These bore the dear departed.
Behind them, broken-hearted,
Came Grief, so noisy a widow, that all said,
“Had he but wed
Her elder sister Sorrow, in her stead!”
And by her, trying to soothe her all the time,
The fatherless children, Colour, Tune, and Rhyme
(The sweet lad Rhyme), ran all-uncomprehending.
Then, at the way’s sad ending,
Round the raw grave they stay’d. Old Wisdom read,
In mumbling tone, the Service for the Dead.
There stood Romance,
The furrowing tears had mark’d her rougиd cheek;
Poor old Conceit, his wonder unassuaged;
Dead Innocency’s daughter, Ignorance;
And shabby, ill-dress’d Generosity;
And Argument, too full of woe to speak;
Passion, grown portly, something middle-aged;
And Friendship—not a minute older, she;
Impatience, ever taking out his watch;
Faith, who was deaf, and had to lean, to catch
Old Wisdom’s endless drone.
Beauty was there,
Pale in her black; dry-eyed; she stood alone.
Poor maz’d Imagination; Fancy wild;
Ardour, the sunlight on his greying hair;
Contentment, who had known Youth as a child
And never seen him since. And Spring came too,
Dancing over the tombs, and brought him flowers—
She did not stay for long.
And Truth, and Grace, and all the merry crew,
The laughing Winds and Rivers, and lithe Hours;
And Hope, the dewy-eyed; and sorrowing Song;—
Yes, with much woe and mourning general,
At dead Youth’s funeral,
Even these were met once more together, all,
Who erst the fair and living Youth did know;
All, except only Love. Love had died long ago.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "The Funeral of Youth: Threnody" by Rupert Brooke is written in free verse with a loose structure. It consists of five stanzas of varying lengths, each exploring different aspects of Youth's funeral. The lack of a consistent rhyme scheme or meter adds to the feeling of lament and mourning in the poem. The irregular structure mirrors the chaotic emotions and varied reactions of the mourners at the funeral.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem revolves around the passage of time and the inevitability of growing old. Through the funeral of Youth, Brooke explores the loss of innocence, idealism, and passion that come with age. The imagery in the poem vividly captures the procession of mourners, each representing a different aspect of Youth that has been lost. From Folly and Laughter to Grief and Wisdom, each character symbolizes a facet of Youth that is mourned and remembered.

### Literary Devices

Brooke employs various literary devices to enhance the emotional impact of the poem. Personification is used to give human-like qualities to abstract concepts such as Folly, Grief, and Wisdom, creating a sense of intimacy and familiarity with these characters. Symbolism is also prevalent throughout the poem, with each mourner representing a specific trait or emotion associated with Youth. Additionally, the use of vivid imagery, such as "furrowing tears" on Romance's cheek and Spring dancing over the tombs, evokes a strong sense of visual and emotional imagery.

### Historical and Personal Context

Written during the early 20th century, Brooke's poem reflects the societal changes and disillusionment of the post-World War I era. The loss of Youth can be seen as a metaphor for the loss of innocence and optimism in the face of war and hardship. Brooke himself was a young poet who tragically died during World War I, adding a personal dimension to the themes of loss and mortality in the poem.

### Deep Reading

"The Funeral of Youth: Threnody" can be interpreted as a meditation on the fleeting nature of youth and the inevitability of aging and mortality. The mourners at Youth's funeral represent the various aspects of life that are lost as one grows older, from passion and idealism to innocence and imagination. The absence of Love at the funeral signifies the enduring pain of lost relationships and the inability to fully recover from such losses. Ultimately, the poem serves as a poignant reminder of the transience of youth and the importance of cherishing every moment before it is gone.

## Disabled by Wilfred Owen

```
He sat in a wheeled chair, waiting for dark,
And shivered in his ghastly suit of grey,
Legless, sewn short at elbow.  Through the park
Voices of boys rang saddening like a hymn,
Voices of play and pleasure after day,
Till gathering sleep had mothered them from him.

About this time Town used to swing so gay
When glow-lamps budded in the light-blue trees
And girls glanced lovelier as the air grew dim,
-- In the old times, before he threw away his knees.
Now he will never feel again how slim
Girls' waists are, or how warm their subtle hands,
All of them touch him like some queer disease.

There was an artist silly for his face,
For it was younger than his youth, last year.
Now he is old; his back will never brace;
He's lost his colour very far from here,
Poured it down shell-holes till the veins ran dry,
And half his lifetime lapsed in the hot race,
And leap of purple spurted from his thigh.
One time he liked a bloodsmear down his leg,
After the matches carried shoulder-high.
It was after football, when he'd drunk a peg,
He thought he'd better join.  He wonders why . . .
Someone had said he'd look a god in kilts.

That's why; and maybe, too, to please his Meg,
Aye, that was it, to please the giddy jilts,
He asked to join.  He didn't have to beg;
Smiling they wrote his lie; aged nineteen years.
Germans he scarcely thought of; and no fears
Of Fear came yet.  He thought of jewelled hilts
For daggers in plaid socks; of smart salutes;
And care of arms; and leave; and pay arrears;
Esprit de corps; and hints for young recruits.
And soon, he was drafted out with drums and cheers.

Some cheered him home, but not as crowds cheer Goal.
Only a solemn man who brought him fruits
Thanked him; and then inquired about his soul.
Now, he will spend a few sick years in Institutes,
And do what things the rules consider wise,
And take whatever pity they may dole.
To-night he noticed how the women's eyes
Passed from him to the strong men that were whole.
How cold and late it is!  Why don't they come
And put him into bed?  Why don't they come?
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

In terms of form, Wilfred Owen's poem "Disabled" consists of seven stanzas, each with a varying number of lines. The irregular line lengths mirror the disjointed and fragmented experience of the disabled soldier being depicted in the poem. The lack of a consistent rhyme scheme also contributes to the sense of disorientation and loss experienced by the protagonist.

The meter of the poem is primarily iambic pentameter, with lines such as "Voices of boys rang saddening like a hymn" following a pattern of unstressed syllables followed by stressed syllables. This regular meter creates a sense of rhythm and flow in the poem, contrasting with the chaotic and tragic content.

### Themes and Imagery

One of the central themes of the poem is the devastating impact of war on individuals, particularly focusing on the physical and emotional toll it takes on soldiers. The imagery used by Owen is vivid and poignant, painting a picture of a young man who has been irreparably damaged by his experiences in war. The image of the legless soldier sitting in a wheeled chair, isolated and disconnected from the world around him, evokes a sense of profound loss and alienation.

The contrast between the vibrant memories of his youth and the bleak reality of his present situation highlights the theme of disillusionment and regret. The imagery of the town "swinging so gay" and the girls growing lovelier in the fading light serves to emphasize the stark contrast between the soldier's past and present.

### Literary Devices

Owen employs various literary devices to convey the themes of the poem effectively. One notable device is irony, as seen in lines such as "One time he liked a bloodsmear down his leg," where the soldier's initial enthusiasm and naivety about war are juxtaposed with the harsh reality of his current situation.

Another important literary device used in the poem is simile, as in the line "All of them touch him like some queer disease," where the soldier's physical disability is likened to a contagious illness. This comparison serves to emphasize the sense of isolation and alienation experienced by the protagonist.

### Historical and Personal Context

Wilfred Owen was a British poet who served as a soldier in World War I, and his poetry is deeply influenced by his firsthand experiences of the horrors of war. "Disabled" reflects Owen's anti-war sentiments and his belief in the futility and senselessness of armed conflict. The poem sheds light on the physical and psychological trauma endured by soldiers, highlighting the lasting consequences of war on individuals and society as a whole.

The poem also touches on themes of youth, sacrifice, and the loss of innocence, reflecting the broader cultural and historical context of World War I, a conflict that profoundly impacted an entire generation.

### Deep Reading

In a deeper analysis of "Disabled," one can interpret the poem as a powerful critique of the glorification of war and the harsh realities faced by those who are left disabled and disillusioned by their experiences on the battlefield. The poem challenges conventional notions of heroism and sacrifice, exposing the human cost of war and the devastating effects it has on individuals long after the fighting has ceased.

The repeated question at the end of the poem, "Why don't they come?" underscores the soldier's profound sense of abandonment and isolation, highlighting the indifference and neglect faced by many wounded veterans. Through its evocative imagery and poignant storytelling, "Disabled" forces readers to confront the grim consequences of war and the lasting impact it has on those who are left scarred and broken.

## Beauty by Edward Thomas

```
WHAT does it mean? Tired, angry, and ill at ease,
No man, woman, or child alive could please
Me now. And yet I almost dare to laugh
Because I sit and frame an epitaph--
"Here lies all that no one loved of him
And that loved no one." Then in a trice that
    whim
Has wearied. But, though I am like a river
At fall of evening while it seems that never
Has the sun lighted it or warmed it, while
Cross breezes cut the surface to a file,
This heart, some fraction of me, happily
Floats through the window even now to a tree
Down in the misting, dim-lit, quiet vale,
Not like a pewit that returns to wail
For something it has lost, but like a dove
That slants unswerving to its home and love.
There I find my rest, and through the dusk air
Flies what yet lives in me. Beauty is there.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme
