## In Memory by Joyce Kilmer

```
I
Serene and beautiful and very wise,
Most erudite in curious Grecian lore,
You lay and read your learned books, and bore
A weight of unshed tears and silent sighs.
The song within your heart could never rise
Until love bade it spread its wings and soar.
Nor could you look on Beauty's face before
A poet's burning mouth had touched your eyes.
Love is made out of ecstasy and wonder;
Love is a poignant and accustomed pain.
It is a burst of Heaven-shaking thunder;
It is a linnet's fluting after rain.
Love's voice is through your song; above and under
And in each note to echo and remain.

II
Because Mankind is glad and brave and young,
Full of gay flames that white and scarlet glow,
All joys and passions that Mankind may know
By you were nobly felt and nobly sung.
Because Mankind's heart every day is wrung
By Fate's wild hands that twist and tear it so,
Therefore you echoed Man's undying woe,
A harp Aeolian on Life's branches hung.
So did the ghosts of toiling children hover
About the piteous portals of your mind;
Your eyes, that looked on glory, could discover
The angry scar to which the world was blind:
And it was grief that made Mankind your lover,
And it was grief that made you love Mankind.

III
Before Christ left the Citadel of Light,
To tread the dreadful way of human birth,
His shadow sometimes fell upon the earth
And those who saw it wept with joy and fright.
"Thou art Apollo, than the sun more bright!"
They cried.  "Our music is of little worth,
But thrill our blood with thy creative mirth
Thou god of song, thou lord of lyric might!"
O singing pilgrim! who could love and follow
Your lover Christ, through even love's despair,
You knew within the cypress-darkened hollow
The feet that on the mountain are so fair.
For it was Christ that was your own Apollo,
And thorns were in the laurel on your hair.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

Joyce Kilmer's "In Memory" is a sonnet divided into three stanzas, each exploring different aspects of love, humanity, and spirituality. The poem follows a traditional Petrarchan (or Italian) sonnet form, with an octave (the first two quatrains) followed by a sestet (the final quatrain and tercet). The rhyme scheme is ABBA ABBA CDC CDC, typical of Petrarchan sonnets. This structure allows Kilmer to develop his ideas in a systematic and organized manner, starting with the subject's wisdom and unrequited love, moving to their empathy for mankind's suffering, and culminating in a spiritual reflection on Christ's influence.

The meter of the poem is primarily iambic pentameter, with lines like "Most erudite in curious Grecian lore" and "By Fate's wild hands that twist and tear it so" following this pattern. The consistent meter gives the poem a formal and rhythmic quality, enhancing its lyrical and contemplative nature.

### Themes and Imagery

The central themes of the poem revolve around love, human suffering, empathy, and spirituality. In the first stanza, Kilmer explores the transformative power of love, portraying it as both ecstatic and painful, using vivid imagery like "Heaven-shaking thunder" and "a linnet's fluting after rain" to convey the depth and complexity of love. The second stanza delves into the poet's empathy for mankind's struggles, depicting their ability to feel and express universal human emotions through their poetry.

The third stanza introduces a spiritual dimension, drawing parallels between the subject and Christ as embodiments of creative and redemptive forces. The imagery of Christ as Apollo and the poet as a "singing pilgrim" highlights the connection between art, faith, and suffering. Overall, the poem weaves together themes of love, grief, artistic inspiration, and divine presence to create a rich tapestry of emotions and ideas.

### Literary Devices

Kilmer employs various literary devices to enhance the poem's impact and meaning. One notable device is alliteration, as seen in lines like "serene and beautiful and very wise" and "burst of Heaven-shaking thunder," which create a musical quality and emphasize key words. The use of metaphor is also prevalent, such as comparing love to a "burst of Heaven-shaking thunder" and a "linnet's fluting after rain," adding depth and vividness to the descriptions.

Additionally, Kilmer uses personification in lines like "love bade it spread its wings and soar" and "Fate's wild hands that twist and tear it so," attributing human qualities to abstract concepts like love and fate. This personification serves to humanize these forces and make them more relatable to the reader.

### Historical and Personal Context

Written during the early 20th century, "In Memory" reflects the poet's Catholic faith and his profound sense of spirituality. Joyce Kilmer's own life was marked by tragedy, including the loss of his daughter and his eventual death in World War I, which adds a poignant layer of personal experience to the themes of love and grief in the poem. The references to Christ, Apollo, and themes of redemption suggest Kilmer's deep engagement with religious and mythological symbolism.

The poem also resonates with the broader cultural context of the time, characterized by upheaval, war, and social change. Kilmer's exploration of human suffering and empathy for mankind's struggles may reflect the turmoil and uncertainty of the early 20th century, as well as a search for solace and meaning in the face of adversity.

### Deep Reading

Through "In Memory," Joyce Kilmer invites readers to contemplate the transformative power of love, the universal experience of human suffering, and the spiritual dimensions of art and faith. The poem moves beyond individual emotions to explore broader themes of empathy, creativity, and redemption, connecting personal experiences to larger truths about the human condition.

By intertwining personal reflections with philosophical and spiritual insights, Kilmer creates a multi-layered narrative that invites readers to delve deeper into the complexities of love, grief, and the search for meaning. Ultimately, "In Memory" serves as a meditation on the interconnectedness of human emotions, artistic expression, and divine presence, offering a profound and thought-provoking exploration of life's joys and sorrows.

## Waring by Robert Browning

```
What's become of Waring
Since he gave us all the slip,
Chose land-travel or seafaring,
Boots and chest or staff and scrip,
Rather than pace up and down
Any longer London town?

Who'd have guessed it from his lip
Or his brow's accustomed bearing,
On the night he thus took ship
Or started landward?--little caring
For us, it seems, who supped together
(Friends of his too, I remember)
And walked home thro' the merry weather,
The snowiest in all December.
I left his arm that night myself
For what's-his-name's, the new prose-poet
Who wrote the book there, on the shelf--
How, forsooth, was I to know it
If Waring meant to glide away
Like a ghost at break of day?
Never looked he half so gay!

He was prouder than the devil:
How he must have cursed our revel!
Ay and many other meetings,
Indoor visits, outdoor greetings,
As up and down he paced this London,
With no work done, but great works undone,
Where scarce twenty knew his name.
Why not, then, have earlier spoken,
Written, bustled? Who's to blame
If your silence kept unbroken?
"True, but there were sundry jottings,
Stray-leaves, fragments, blurs and blottings,
Certain first steps were achieved
Already which (is that your meaning?)
Had well borne out whoe'er believed
In more to come!"  But who goes gleaning
Hedgeside chance-glades, while full-sheaved
Stand cornfields by him?  Pride, o'erweening
Pride alone, puts forth such claims
O'er the day's distinguished names.

Meantime, how much I loved him,
I find out now I've lost him.
I who cared not if I moved him,
Who could so carelessly accost him,
Henceforth never shall get free
Of his ghostly company,
His eyes that just a little wink
As deep I go into the merit
Of this and that distinguished spirit--
His cheeks' raised colour, soon to sink,
As long I dwell on some stupendous
And tremendous (Heaven defend us!)
Monstr'-inform'-ingens-horrend-ous
Demoniaco-seraphic
Penman's latest piece of graphic.
Nay, my very wrist grows warm
With his dragging weight of arm.
E'en so, swimmingly appears,
Through one's after-supper musings,
Some lost lady of old years
With her beauteous vain endeavour
And goodness unrepaid as ever;
The face, accustomed to refusings,
We, puppies that we were... Oh never
Surely, nice of conscience, scrupled
Being aught like false, forsooth, to?
Telling aught but honest truth to?
What a sin, had we centupled
Its possessor's grace and sweetness!
No! she heard in its completeness
Truth, for truth's a weighty matter,
And truth, at issue, we can't flatter!
Well, 'tis done with; she's exempt
From damning us thro' such a sally;
And so she glides, as down a valley,
Taking up with her contempt,
Past our reach; and in, the flowers
Shut her unregarded hours.

Oh, could I have him back once more,
This Waring, but one half-day more!
Back, with the quiet face of yore,
So hungry for acknowledgment
Like mine! I'd fool him to his bent.
Feed, should not he, to heart's content?
I'd say, "to only have conceived,
Planned your great works, apart from progress,
Surpasses little works achieved!"
I'd lie so, I should be believed.
I'd make such havoc of the claims
Of the day's distinguished names
To feast him with, as feasts an ogress
Her feverish sharp-toothed gold-crowned child!
Or as one feasts a creature rarely
Captured here, unreconciled
To capture; and completely gives
Its pettish humours license, barely
Requiring that it lives.

Ichabod, Ichabod,
The glory is departed!
Travels Waring East away?
Who, of knowledge, by hearsay,
Reports a man upstarted
Somewhere as a god,
Hordes grown European-hearted,
Millions of the wild made tame
On a sudden at his fame?
In Vishnu-land what Avatar?
Or who in Moscow, toward the Czar,
With the demurest of footfalls
Over the Kremlin's pavement bright
With serpentine and syenite,
Steps, with five other Generals
That simultaneously take snuff,
For each to have pretext enough
And kerchiefwise unfold his sash
Which, softness' self, is yet the stuff
To hold fast where a steel chain snaps,
And leave the grand white neck no gash?
Waring in Moscow, to those rough
Cold northern natures born perhaps,
Like the lamb-white maiden dear
From the circle of mute kings
Unable to repress the tear,
Each as his sceptre down he flings,
To Dian's fane at Taurica,
Where now a captive priestess, she alway
Mingles her tender grave Hellenic speech
With theirs, tuned to the hailstone-beaten beach
As pours some pigeon, from the myrrhy lands
Rapt by the whirlblast to fierce Scythian strands
Where breed the swallows, her melodious cry
Amid their barbarous twitter!
In Russia?  Never!  Spain were fitter!
Ay, most likely 'tis in Spain
That we and Waring meet again
Now, while he turns down that cool narrow lane
Into the blackness, out of grave Madrid
All fire and shine, abrupt as when there's slid
Its stiff gold blazing pall
From some black coffin-lid.
Or, best of all,
I love to think
The leaving us was just a feint;
Back here to London did he slink,
And now works on without a wink
Of sleep, and we are on the brink
Of something great in fresco-paint:
Some garret's ceiling, walls and floor,
Up and down and o'er and o'er
He splashes, as none splashed before
Since great Caldara Polidore.
Or Music means this land of ours
Some favour yet, to pity won
By Purcell from his Rosy Bowers--
"Give me my so-long promised son,
Let Waring end what I begun!"
Then down he creeps and out he steals
Only when the night conceals
His face; in Kent 'tis cherry-time,
Or hops are picking: or at prime
Of March he wanders as, too happy,
Years ago when he was young,
Some mild eve when woods grew sappy
And the early moths had sprung
To life from many a trembling sheath
Woven the warm boughs beneath;
While small birds said to themselves
What should soon be actual song,
And young gnats, by tens and twelves,
Made as if they were the throng
That crowd around and carry aloft
The sound they have nursed, so sweet and pure,
Out of a myriad noises soft,
Into a tone that can endure
Amid the noise of a July noon
When all God's creatures crave their boon,
All at once and all in tune,
And get it, happy as Waring then,
Having first within his ken
What a man might do with men:
And far too glad, in the even-glow,
To mix with the world he meant to take
Into his hand, he told you, so--
And out of it his world to make,
To contract and to expand
As he shut or oped his hand.
Oh Waring, what's to really be?
A clear stage and a crowd to see!
Some Garrick, say, out shall not he
The heart of Hamlet's mystery pluck?
Or, where most unclean beasts are rife,
Some Junius--am I right?--shall tuck
His sleeve, and forth with flaying-knife!
Some Chatterton shall have the luck
Of calling Rowley into life!
Some one shall somehow run a muck
With this old world for want of strife
Sound asleep. Contrive, contrive
To rouse us, Waring! Who's alive?
Our men scarce seem in earnest now.
Distinguished names!--but 'tis, somehow,
As if they played at being names
Still more distinguished, like the games
Of children. Turn our sport to earnest
With a visage of the sternest!
Bring the real times back, confessed
Still better than our very best!

"When I last saw Waring..."
(How all turned to him who spoke!
You saw Waring? Truth or joke?
In land-travel or sea-faring?)

"We were sailing by Triest
Where a day or two we harboured:
A sunset was in the West,
When, looking over the vessel's side,
One of our company espied
A sudden speck to larboard.
And as a sea-duck flies and swims
At once, so came the light craft up,
With its sole lateen sail that trims
And turns (the water round its rims
Dancing, as round a sinking cup)
And by us like a fish it curled,
And drew itself up close beside,
Its great sail on the instant furled,
And o'er its thwarts a shrill voice cried,
(A neck as bronzed as a Lascar's)
'Buy wine of us, you English Brig?
Or fruit, tobacco and cigars?
A pilot for you to Triest?
Without one, look you ne'er so big,
They'll never let you up the bay!
We natives should know best.'
I turned, and 'just those fellows' way,'
Our captain said, 'The 'long-shore thieves
Are laughing at us in their sleeves.'

"In truth, the boy leaned laughing back;
And one, half-hidden by his side
Under the furled sail, soon I spied,
With great grass hat and kerchief black,
Who looked up with his kingly throat,
Said somewhat, while the other shook
His hair back from his eyes to look
Their longest at us; then the boat,
I know not how, turned sharply round,
Laying her whole side on the sea
As a leaping fish does; from the lee
Into the weather, cut somehow
Her sparkling path beneath our bow
And so went off, as with a bound,
Into the rosy and golden half
O' the sky, to overtake the sun
And reach the shore, like the sea-calf
Its singing cave; yet I caught one
Glance ere away the boat quite passed,
And neither time nor toil could mar
Those features: so I saw the last
Of Waring!"--You?  Oh, never star
Was lost here but it rose afar!
Look East, where whole new thousands are!
In Vishnu-land what Avatar?
```

## Disabled by Wilfred Owen

```
He sat in a wheeled chair, waiting for dark,
And shivered in his ghastly suit of grey,
Legless, sewn short at elbow.  Through the park
Voices of boys rang saddening like a hymn,
Voices of play and pleasure after day,
Till gathering sleep had mothered them from him.

About this time Town used to swing so gay
When glow-lamps budded in the light-blue trees
And girls glanced lovelier as the air grew dim,
-- In the old times, before he threw away his knees.
Now he will never feel again how slim
Girls' waists are, or how warm their subtle hands,
All of them touch him like some queer disease.

There was an artist silly for his face,
For it was younger than his youth, last year.
Now he is old; his back will never brace;
He's lost his colour very far from here,
Poured it down shell-holes till the veins ran dry,
And half his lifetime lapsed in the hot race,
And leap of purple spurted from his thigh.
One time he liked a bloodsmear down his leg,
After the matches carried shoulder-high.
It was after football, when he'd drunk a peg,
He thought he'd better join.  He wonders why . . .
Someone had said he'd look a god in kilts.

That's why; and maybe, too, to please his Meg,
Aye, that was it, to please the giddy jilts,
He asked to join.  He didn't have to beg;
Smiling they wrote his lie; aged nineteen years.
Germans he scarcely thought of; and no fears
Of Fear came yet.  He thought of jewelled hilts
For daggers in plaid socks; of smart salutes;
And care of arms; and leave; and pay arrears;
Esprit de corps; and hints for young recruits.
And soon, he was drafted out with drums and cheers.

Some cheered him home, but not as crowds cheer Goal.
Only a solemn man who brought him fruits
Thanked him; and then inquired about his soul.
Now, he will spend a few sick years in Institutes,
And do what things the rules consider wise,
And take whatever pity they may dole.
To-night he noticed how the women's eyes
Passed from him to the strong men that were whole.
How cold and late it is!  Why don't they come
And put him into bed?  Why don't they come?
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "Disabled" by Wilfred Owen is written in free verse, which means it does not follow a specific rhyme scheme or meter. This lack of traditional structure reflects the chaotic and disorganized nature of the veteran's thoughts and experiences. The poem consists of seven stanzas of varying lengths, each with its own distinct focus on the disabled soldier's physical and emotional struggles. The irregular structure mirrors the soldier's fragmented state of mind and disjointed memories.

### Themes and Imagery

One of the central themes in "Disabled" is the devastating impact of war on an individual. Owen vividly depicts the physical and emotional toll of combat on the disabled soldier, highlighting his sense of isolation, loss, and longing for his past life. The imagery in the poem is stark and haunting, painting a vivid picture of the soldier's wheelchair-bound existence, his memories of youth and vitality, and the indifference of society towards his suffering. The contrast between the soldier's past and present, as well as the juxtaposition of youthful innocence with the harsh reality of war, are powerful themes that resonate throughout the poem.

### Literary Devices

Owen employs several literary devices to convey the soldier's experiences effectively. One notable device is irony, as seen in lines such as "He'd better join. He wonders why." This ironic twist reveals the soldier's naivety and misplaced sense of heroism, highlighting the disillusionment that often accompanies war. Owen also uses vivid imagery, such as "ghastly suit of grey" and "purple spurted from his thigh," to evoke a sense of horror and despair. Additionally, the repetition of the soldier's physical limitations, such as being "legless" and "lost his colour," serves to emphasize his profound sense of loss and alienation.

### Historical and Personal Context

Wilfred Owen was a British poet who served as a soldier in World War I, and his poetry reflects his firsthand experiences of the horrors of war. "Disabled" is a poignant reflection on the physical and psychological wounds inflicted on soldiers during the conflict, as well as the societal neglect and indifference towards veterans after the war. The poem captures the disillusionment and despair felt by many soldiers who returned home disabled and traumatized, shedding light on the harsh realities of war that are often overlooked or forgotten.

### Deep Reading

Through a deep reading of "Disabled," we can uncover the profound themes of sacrifice, loss, and the devastating impact of war on individuals. The soldier's physical disabilities serve as a metaphor for the emotional scars and trauma that war inflicts, highlighting the lasting effects of violence and conflict on the human psyche. The poem's somber tone and poignant imagery convey a sense of tragedy and injustice, underscoring the senseless waste of human life and potential that war engenders. Ultimately, "Disabled" serves as a powerful reminder of the human cost of war and the urgent need for compassion and understanding towards those who have sacrificed so much in service to their country.
