## Disabled by Wilfred Owen

```
He sat in a wheeled chair, waiting for dark,
And shivered in his ghastly suit of grey,
Legless, sewn short at elbow.  Through the park
Voices of boys rang saddening like a hymn,
Voices of play and pleasure after day,
Till gathering sleep had mothered them from him.

About this time Town used to swing so gay
When glow-lamps budded in the light-blue trees
And girls glanced lovelier as the air grew dim,
-- In the old times, before he threw away his knees.
Now he will never feel again how slim
Girls' waists are, or how warm their subtle hands,
All of them touch him like some queer disease.

There was an artist silly for his face,
For it was younger than his youth, last year.
Now he is old; his back will never brace;
He's lost his colour very far from here,
Poured it down shell-holes till the veins ran dry,
And half his lifetime lapsed in the hot race,
And leap of purple spurted from his thigh.
One time he liked a bloodsmear down his leg,
After the matches carried shoulder-high.
It was after football, when he'd drunk a peg,
He thought he'd better join.  He wonders why . . .
Someone had said he'd look a god in kilts.

That's why; and maybe, too, to please his Meg,
Aye, that was it, to please the giddy jilts,
He asked to join.  He didn't have to beg;
Smiling they wrote his lie; aged nineteen years.
Germans he scarcely thought of; and no fears
Of Fear came yet.  He thought of jewelled hilts
For daggers in plaid socks; of smart salutes;
And care of arms; and leave; and pay arrears;
Esprit de corps; and hints for young recruits.
And soon, he was drafted out with drums and cheers.

Some cheered him home, but not as crowds cheer Goal.
Only a solemn man who brought him fruits
Thanked him; and then inquired about his soul.
Now, he will spend a few sick years in Institutes,
And do what things the rules consider wise,
And take whatever pity they may dole.
To-night he noticed how the women's eyes
Passed from him to the strong men that were whole.
How cold and late it is!  Why don't they come
And put him into bed?  Why don't they come?
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "Disabled" by Wilfred Owen consists of seven stanzas with irregular line lengths. The irregularity of the lines contributes to a sense of disjointedness and fragmentation, mirroring the fragmented experiences of the disabled soldier. The poem is written in free verse, lacking a strict rhyme scheme or meter. This lack of formal structure reflects the chaos and disarray of war and its aftermath.

### Themes and Imagery

One of the central themes of the poem is the devastating impact of war on the individual. The imagery used throughout the poem paints a stark picture of the physical and emotional toll of war on the soldier. Lines such as "Legless, sewn short at elbow" and "Poured it down shell-holes till the veins ran dry" vividly depict the soldier's physical injuries and trauma. The contrast between the soldier's memories of his youth and the harsh reality he now faces serves to highlight the loss of innocence and vitality that war brings.

### Literary Devices

Owen employs various literary devices in the poem to convey the soldier's experiences. One such device is imagery, which is used to create vivid and poignant descriptions of the soldier's physical and emotional state. The use of simile in "All of them touch him like some queer disease" emphasizes the soldier's sense of alienation and isolation. The repetition of the word "And" in the final stanza creates a sense of urgency and desperation as the soldier longs for comfort and companionship.

### Historical and Personal Context

Wilfred Owen was a soldier in World War I, and his poetry often reflects the horrors and disillusionment of war. "Disabled" draws on Owen's own experiences and observations of the physical and psychological impact of war on soldiers. The poem highlights the contrast between the romanticized notions of war and the harsh reality faced by those who have been wounded in battle.

### Deep Reading

Through the poem "Disabled," Owen conveys the devastating consequences of war on both the body and the mind. The soldier's physical injuries are evident, but the poem also delves into the psychological wounds he carries. The soldier's isolation and longing for companionship are palpable, underscoring the sense of alienation and disconnection he feels from society. The poem serves as a powerful indictment of the glorification of war and its dehumanizing effects on those who have sacrificed their bodies and souls in its name. Owen's portrayal of the disabled soldier forces readers to confront the harsh realities of war and the lasting impact it has on individuals long after the fighting has ceased.

## Song by Edgar Allan Poe

```
I saw thee on thy bridal day--
  When a burning blush came o'er thee,
Though happiness around thee lay,
  The world all love before thee:

And in thine eye a kindling light
  (Whatever it might be)
Was all on Earth my aching sight
  Of Loveliness could see.

That blush, perhaps, was maiden shame--
  As such it well may pass--
Though its glow hath raised a fiercer flame
  In the breast of him, alas!

Who saw thee on that bridal day,
  When that deep blush _would_ come o'er thee,
Though happiness around thee lay,
  The world all love before thee.
```

The contrast between the happiness surrounding the subject and the internal turmoil of the speaker adds depth to the theme of unfulfilled desire.

### Literary Devices

Poe employs various literary devices to enhance the emotional impact of the poem. The repetition of the lines "When a burning blush came o'er thee" and "Though happiness around thee lay" emphasizes the conflicting emotions of the subject. The use of alliteration in phrases like "kindling light" and "deep blush _would_ come" adds a musical quality to the poem. Additionally, the personification of the blush as raising a "fiercer flame" in the breast of the speaker heightens the intensity of their emotions.

### Historical and Personal Context

Edgar Allan Poe is known for his exploration of themes such as love, loss, and the human psyche in his works. This poem reflects Poe's own experiences with unrequited love and the pain of longing for someone who is unattainable. The imagery of the bridal day may also be a reflection of Poe's personal life, as he had a tumultuous relationship with his wife, Virginia Clemm, who passed away at a young age.

### Deep Reading

On a deeper level, "Song" can be seen as a meditation on the complex nature of love and desire. The juxtaposition of external happiness and internal turmoil in the poem highlights the idea that love is not always straightforward or reciprocated. The speaker's obsessive focus on the subject's blush and light in their eye suggests a fixation on beauty and perfection that is ultimately unattainable. The repetition of certain lines underscores the speaker's inability to move past the memory of the subject on their bridal day, emphasizing the lasting impact of unrequited love.

In conclusion, "Song" by Edgar Allan Poe is a poignant exploration of unrequited love, desire, and the pain of longing. Through its form, imagery, literary devices, and personal context, the poem delves into the complexities of human emotion and the enduring nature of unfulfilled longing.

## A Woman's Shortcomings by Elizabeth Barrett Browning

```
She has laughed as softly as if she sighed,
She has counted six, and over,
Of a purse well filled, and a heart well tried -
Oh, each a worthy lover!
They "give her time"; for her soul must slip
Where the world has set the grooving;
She will lie to none with her fair red lip:
But love seeks truer loving.

She trembles her fan in a sweetness dumb,
As her thoughts were beyond recalling;
With a glance for one, and a glance for some,
From her eyelids rising and falling;
Speaks common words with a blushful air,
Hears bold words, unreproving;
But her silence says - what she never will swear -
And love seeks better loving.

Go, lady! lean to the night-guitar,
And drop a smile to the bringer;
Then smile as sweetly, when he is far,
At the voice of an in-door singer.
Bask tenderly beneath tender eyes;
Glance lightly, on their removing;
And join new vows to old perjuries -
But dare not call it loving!

Unless you can think, when the song is done,
No other is soft in the rhythm;
Unless you can feel, when left by One,
That all men else go with him;
Unless you can know, when unpraised by his breath,
That your beauty itself wants proving;
Unless you can swear "For life, for death!" -
Oh, fear to call it loving!

Unless you can muse in a crowd all day
On the absent face that fixed you;
Unless you can love, as the angels may,
With the breadth of heaven betwixt you;
Unless you can dream that his faith is fast,
Through behoving and unbehoving;
Unless you can die when the dream is past -
Oh, never call it loving!
```
