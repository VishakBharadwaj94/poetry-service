That renovates the World --

## Insensibility by Wilfred Owen

```
I

Happy are men who yet before they are killed
Can let their veins run cold.
Whom no compassion fleers
Or makes their feet
Sore on the alleys cobbled with their brothers.
The front line withers,
But they are troops who fade, not flowers
For poets' tearful fooling:
Men, gaps for filling
Losses who might have fought
Longer; but no one bothers.


    II

And some cease feeling
Even themselves or for themselves.
Dullness best solves
The tease and doubt of shelling,
And Chance's strange arithmetic
Comes simpler than the reckoning of their shilling.
They keep no check on Armies' decimation.


    III

Happy are these who lose imagination:
They have enough to carry with ammunition.
Their spirit drags no pack.
Their old wounds save with cold can not more ache.
Having seen all things red,
Their eyes are rid
Of the hurt of the colour of blood for ever.
And terror's first constriction over,
Their hearts remain small drawn.
Their senses in some scorching cautery of battle
Now long since ironed,
Can laugh among the dying, unconcerned.


    IV

Happy the soldier home, with not a notion
How somewhere, every dawn, some men attack,
And many sighs are drained.
Happy the lad whose mind was never trained:
His days are worth forgetting more than not.
He sings along the march
Which we march taciturn, because of dusk,
The long, forlorn, relentless trend
From larger day to huger night.


    V

We wise, who with a thought besmirch
Blood over all our soul,
How should we see our task
But through his blunt and lashless eyes?
Alive, he is not vital overmuch;
Dying, not mortal overmuch;
Nor sad, nor proud,
Nor curious at all.
He cannot tell
Old men's placidity from his.


    VI

But cursed are dullards whom no cannon stuns,
That they should be as stones.
Wretched are they, and mean
With paucity that never was simplicity.
By choice they made themselves immune
To pity and whatever mourns in man
Before the last sea and the hapless stars;
Whatever mourns when many leave these shores;
Whatever shares
The eternal reciprocity of tears.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "Insensibility" by Wilfred Owen is written in free verse, with varying line lengths and no consistent meter or rhyme scheme. This lack of formal structure reflects the chaotic and disordered nature of war, emphasizing the theme of insensitivity and numbness that pervades the poem.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem is the emotional desensitization that war inflicts on soldiers. Owen explores the idea that in order to cope with the horrors of war, soldiers must detach themselves from their emotions and become numb to the suffering around them. This is evident in lines such as "Happy are these who lose imagination: / They have enough to carry with ammunition," where the soldiers are portrayed as being relieved to have their imagination dulled by the brutal reality of war.

The imagery in the poem is stark and brutal, depicting the physical and emotional toll of war on the soldiers. Owen uses vivid descriptions such as "Their eyes are rid / Of the hurt of the colour of blood for ever" to convey the soldiers' emotional detachment and desensitization to violence. The imagery of soldiers laughing among the dying and marching taciturn emphasizes the dehumanizing effect of war on individuals.

### Literary Devices

Owen employs various literary devices to convey the theme of insensibility in the poem. One notable device is irony, as the speaker ironically refers to the soldiers as "Happy" despite their emotional numbness and detachment. This creates a sense of bleakness and cynicism in the poem, highlighting the paradoxical nature of their supposed happiness in war.

Another literary device used by Owen is repetition, particularly in the repeated use of the word "Happy" at the beginning of each stanza. This repetition serves to emphasize the contrast between the soldiers' outward appearance of contentment and their inner emotional numbness.

### Historical and Personal Context

Wilfred Owen was a soldier in World War I, and his poetry reflects his firsthand experience of the horrors of war. "Insensibility" was written during a time when the realities of war were becoming increasingly apparent, and Owen's personal experiences on the front lines heavily influenced the themes and imagery in the poem. The poem captures the disillusionment and emotional numbness that many soldiers felt as a result of the senseless violence and destruction of war.

### Deep Reading

Through the dispassionate tone and detached observations of the speaker, Owen conveys the dehumanizing effects of war on individuals. The soldiers in the poem are portrayed as being stripped of their humanity and reduced to mere shells of their former selves, devoid of emotion and empathy. The poem serves as a powerful critique of the glorification of war and highlights the psychological toll it takes on those who experience it firsthand.

Overall, "Insensibility" is a poignant and haunting portrayal of the emotional desensitization that war engenders in individuals. Owen's vivid imagery, use of irony, and personal insights into the horrors of war combine to create a powerful and thought-provoking poem that resonates with readers long after they have finished reading it.

## May 23 by Edward Thomas

```
THERE never was a finer day,
And never will be while May is May,--
The third, and not the last of its kind;
But though fair and clear the two behind
Seemed pursued by tempests overpast;
And the morrow with fear that it could not last
Was spoiled. To-day ere the stones were warm
Five minutes of thunderstorm
Dashed it with rain, as if to secure,
By one tear, its beauty the luck to endure.

At mid-day then along the lane
Old Jack Noman appeared again,
Jaunty and old, crooked and tall,
And stopped and grinned at me over the wall,
With a cowslip bunch in his button-hole
And one in his cap. Who could say if his roll
Came from flints in the road, the weather, or ale?
He was welcome as the nightingale.
Not an hour of the sun had been wasted on Jack
"I've got my Indian complexion back"
Said he. He was tanned like a harvester,
Like his short clay pipe, like the leaf and bur
That clung to his coat from last night's bed,
Like the ploughland crumbling red.
Fairer flowers were none on the earth
Than his cowslips wet with the dew of their birth,
Or fresher leaves than the cress in his basket.
"Where did they come from, Jack?" "Don't ask it,
And you'll be told no lies." "Very well:
Then I can't buy." "I don't want to sell.
Take them and these flowers, too, free.
Perhaps you have something to give me?
Wait till next time. The better the day . . .
The Lord couldn't make a better, I say;
If he could, he never has done."
So off went Jack with his roll-walk-run,
Leaving his cresses from Oakshott rill
And his cowslips from Wheatham hill.

'Twas the first day that the midges bit;
But though they bit me, I was glad of it:
Of the dust in my face, too, I was glad.
Spring could do nothing to make me sad.
Bluebells hid all the ruts in the copse.
The elm seeds lay in the road like hops,
That fine day, May the twenty-third,
The day Jack Noman disappeared.
```
