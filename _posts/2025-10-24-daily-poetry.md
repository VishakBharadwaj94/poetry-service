## From “Later Life” by Christina Rossetti

```
VI
We lack, yet cannot fix upon the lack:
Not this, nor that; yet somewhat, certainly.
We see the things we do not yearn to see
Around us: and what see we glancing back?
Lost hopes that leave our hearts upon the rack,
Hopes that were never ours yet seem’d to be,
For which we steer’d on life’s salt stormy sea
Braving the sunstroke and the frozen pack.
If thus to look behind is all in vain,
And all in vain to look to left or right,
Why face we not our future once again,
Launching with hardier hearts across the main,
Straining dim eyes to catch the invisible sight,
And strong to bear ourselves in patient pain?

IX
Star Sirius and the Pole Star dwell afar
Beyond the drawings each of other’s strength:
One blazes through the brief bright summer’s length
Lavishing life-heat from a flaming car;
While one unchangeable upon a throne
Broods o’er the frozen heart of earth alone,
Content to reign the bright particular star
Of some who wander or of some who groan.
They own no drawings each of other’s strength,
Nor vibrate in a visible sympathy,
Nor veer along their courses each toward
Yet are their orbits pitch’d in harmony
Of one dear heaven, across whose depth and length
Mayhap they talk together without speech.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

In terms of form, both poems are structured as sonnets, with fourteen lines each. The first poem (VI) follows a traditional Petrarchan or Italian sonnet form with an octave (eight lines) followed by a sestet (six lines). This structure allows for the exploration of contrasting ideas or emotions. The rhyme scheme in this poem is ABBAABBA CDCDCD, typical of Petrarchan sonnets. The second poem (IX) also follows a sonnet structure but with a different rhyme scheme of ABAB CDCD EFEF GG, more reminiscent of a Shakespearean or English sonnet.

In terms of meter, both poems are written in iambic pentameter, with lines consisting of five feet of unstressed and stressed syllables. This meter creates a steady and rhythmic flow, enhancing the musicality of the poems.

### Themes and Imagery

The themes in these poems revolve around introspection, loss, hope, and perseverance. In "VI," Rossetti explores the idea of facing the past and the future, grappling with lost hopes and the uncertainty of the future. The imagery in this poem is vivid, with references to sailing on life's stormy sea, facing sunstroke and frozen pack, and launching with hardier hearts across the main. These images evoke a sense of struggle and determination in the face of adversity.

In "IX," the theme of distance and connection is prominent. Rossetti uses the celestial bodies of Star Sirius and the Pole Star to explore the idea of distance and harmony. The imagery of one star blazing through summer and the other reigning over the frozen heart of earth creates a contrast between warmth and coldness, change and stability. The idea of these stars talking together without speech suggests a deeper connection beyond physical proximity.

### Literary Devices

Rossetti employs various literary devices in these poems to enhance their meaning and emotional impact. In "VI," she uses paradox in the lines "We lack, yet cannot fix upon the lack" to highlight the speaker's sense of longing and confusion. The repetition of "all in vain" emphasizes the futility of looking back and sideways, urging the reader to focus on the future. In "IX," she uses personification in the description of the stars, giving them human-like qualities and emotions. The metaphor of the stars as distant yet harmonious companions conveys a sense of unity and understanding.

Additionally, Rossetti uses symbolism in both poems, with the sea symbolizing life's challenges and the stars representing guidance and connection. These symbols add depth and layers of meaning to the poems, inviting readers to reflect on their own experiences and aspirations.

### Historical and Personal Context

Christina Rossetti was a Victorian poet known for her introspective and religious themes. As a woman living in the 19th century, she faced societal restrictions and expectations that influenced her writing. The themes of loss, hope, and perseverance in these poems reflect the personal struggles and uncertainties that Rossetti may have experienced in her own life.

The reference to sailing on life's stormy sea in "VI" could be seen as a metaphor for the challenges and obstacles faced by individuals in a rapidly changing world. The celestial imagery in "IX" may also reflect Rossetti's spiritual beliefs and fascination with the natural world, which often inspired her poetry.

### Deep Reading

In a deeper analysis, these poems can be seen as reflections on the human experience and the eternal quest for meaning and connection. The contrast between looking back at lost hopes in "VI" and looking ahead with hope and determination resonates with readers on a universal level. The idea of finding harmony in distance and difference in "IX" speaks to the importance of understanding and empathy in relationships.

Overall, Rossetti's exploration of past regrets, future aspirations, and the interconnectedness of all beings invites readers to contemplate their own journeys and connections with the world around them. Through rich imagery, powerful metaphors, and nuanced language, these poems offer profound insights into the complexities of human emotions and relationships.

## I Wandered Lonely As A Cloud by William Wordsworth

```
I wandered lonely as a cloud
That floats on high o'er vales and hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
A host, of golden daffodils;
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.

Continuous as the stars that shine
And twinkle on the milky way,
They stretched in never-ending line
Along the margin of a bay:
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.

 The waves beside them danced, but they
Out-did the sparkling leaves in glee;
A poet could not be but gay,
In such a jocund company!
I gazed—and gazed—but little thought
What wealth the show to me had brought:

For oft, when on my couch I lie
In vacant or in pensive mood,
They flash upon that inward eye
Which is the bliss of solitude;
And then my heart with pleasure fills,
And dances with the daffodils.
```

### Themes and Imagery

One of the central themes of the poem is the beauty and inspiration that can be found in nature. Wordsworth uses vivid imagery to depict a scene of natural beauty, with the speaker encountering a "host of golden daffodils" that are described as "fluttering and dancing in the breeze." The daffodils are portrayed as a source of joy and wonder, bringing a sense of happiness to the speaker's heart.

The imagery of the daffodils "continuous as the stars that shine" and "stretching in never-ending line" conveys a sense of abundance and infinity, emphasizing the timeless and eternal quality of nature. The juxtaposition of the natural world with the human world, as seen in the comparison between the waves and the daffodils, highlights the transcendent power of nature to uplift and inspire.

### Literary Devices

Wordsworth employs several literary devices in the poem to enhance its poetic effect. One notable device is personification, as the daffodils are described as "dancing in the breeze" and "tossing their heads in sprightly dance." This personification imbues the flowers with human-like qualities, creating a sense of animation and vitality in the natural world.

The use of simile is also evident in the comparison of the daffodils to stars and the waves. This simile serves to highlight the beauty and brightness of the daffodils, emphasizing their radiant and celestial quality.

Additionally, the repetition of the word "gazed" in the poem creates a sense of contemplation and reflection, underscoring the profound impact that the daffodils have on the speaker's emotions and thoughts.

The poem reflects Wordsworth's belief in the restorative and spiritual qualities of nature, as well as his interest in exploring the connection between nature and the human experience.

Wordsworth's personal experiences and reflections on nature are evident in the poem, as the speaker's encounter with the daffodils leads to a moment of joy and inspiration. This personal connection to nature reflects Wordsworth's own belief in the importance of nature as a source of solace and renewal in a world marked by industrialization and urbanization.
