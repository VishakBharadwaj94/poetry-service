## I Wandered Lonely As A Cloud by William Wordsworth

```
I wandered lonely as a cloud
That floats on high o'er vales and hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
A host, of golden daffodils;
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.

Continuous as the stars that shine
And twinkle on the milky way,
They stretched in never-ending line
Along the margin of a bay:
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.

 The waves beside them danced, but they
Out-did the sparkling leaves in glee;
A poet could not be but gay,
In such a jocund company!
I gazed—and gazed—but little thought
What wealth the show to me had brought:

For oft, when on my couch I lie
In vacant or in pensive mood,
They flash upon that inward eye
Which is the bliss of solitude;
And then my heart with pleasure fills,
And dances with the daffodils.
```

## Home Thoughts, From Abroad by Robert Browning

```
Oh, to be in England
Now that April's there,
And whoever wakes in England
Sees, some morning, unaware,
That the lowest boughs and the brushwood sheaf
Round the elm-tree bole are in tiny leaf,
While the chaffinch sings on the orchard bough
In England--now!

And after April, when May follows,
And the white-throat builds, and all the swallows!
Hark I where my blossomed pear tree in the hedge
Leans to the field and scatters on the clover
Blossoms and dewdrops--at the bent spray's edge--
That's the wise thrush; he sings each song twice over,
Lest you should think he never could recapture
The first fine careless rapture!
And though the fields look rough with hoary dew,
All will be gay when noontide wakes anew
The buttercups, the little children's dower
--Far brighter than this gaudy melon-flower!
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

In terms of form, "Home Thoughts, From Abroad" by Robert Browning is a sonnet consisting of two stanzas.

## Stars by Joyce Kilmer

```
(For the Rev. James J. Daly, S. J.)

Bright stars, yellow stars, flashing through the air,
Are you errant strands of Lady Mary's hair?
As she slits the cloudy veil and bends down through,
Do you fall across her cheeks and over heaven too?
Gay stars, little stars, you are little eyes,
Eyes of baby angels playing in the skies.
Now and then a winged child turns his merry face
Down toward the spinning world -- what a funny place!
Jesus Christ came from the Cross (Christ receive my soul!)
In each perfect hand and foot there was a bloody hole.
Four great iron spikes there were, red and never dry,
Michael plucked them from the Cross and set them in the sky.
Christ's Troop, Mary's Guard, God's own men,
Draw your swords and strike at Hell and strike again.
Every steel-born spark that flies where God's battles are,
Flashes past the face of God, and is a star.
```

### Word Suggestions

Consider these word pairs that complement your poem's tone:

- **belly** (Germanic) / **abdomen** (Latinate)
  - *The word 'belly' conveys a more intimate and colloquial tone, suggesting a personal and emotional connection.

- **brotherly** (Germanic) / **fraternal** (Latinate)
  - *'Brotherly' carries a sense of familiarity, love, and camaraderie, emphasizing the emotional bond between siblings. 'Fraternal' is more formal and technical, focusing on the biological relationship.

- **spring** (Germanic) / **vernal** (Latinate)
  - *'Spring' is commonly associated with renewal, growth, and vibrant energy, symbolizing new beginnings and fresh starts. 'Vernal' is a more archaic and poetic term for spring, emphasizing its seasonal aspect.
