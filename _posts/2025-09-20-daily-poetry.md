## Heaven by Rupert Brooke

```
Fish (fly-replete, in depth of June,
Dawdling away their wat'ry noon)
Ponder deep wisdom, dark or clear,
Each secret fishy hope or fear.
Fish say, they have their Stream and Pond;
But is there anything Beyond?
This life cannot be All, they swear,
For how unpleasant, if it were!
One may not doubt that, somehow, Good
Shall come of Water and of Mud;
And, sure, the reverent eye must see
A Purpose in Liquidity.
We darkly know, by Faith we cry,
The future is not Wholly Dry.
Mud unto mud!—Death eddies near—
Not here the appointed End, not here!
But somewhere, beyond Space and Time,
Is wetter water, slimier slime!
And there (they trust) there swimmeth One
Who swam ere rivers were begun,
Immense, of fishy form and mind,
Squamous, omnipotent, and kind;
And under that Almighty Fin,
The littlest fish may enter in.
Oh! never fly conceals a hook,
Fish say, in the Eternal Brook,
But more than mundane weeds are there,
And mud, celestially fair;
Fat caterpillars drift around,
And Paradisal grubs are found;
Unfading moths, immortal flies,
And the worm that never dies.
And in that heaven of all their wish,
There shall be no more land, say fish.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

Rupert Brooke's poem "Heaven" consists of a single stanza with a total of twenty-five lines. The poem is written in free verse, meaning it does not adhere to a specific rhyme scheme or meter. This lack of strict form mirrors the theme of the poem, which explores ideas of eternity and the afterlife beyond the constraints of earthly time and space. The irregularity in structure allows for a sense of freedom and expansiveness in the exploration of these profound concepts.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of "Heaven" revolves around the idea of an afterlife for fish, exploring their beliefs and hopes for existence beyond the earthly realm. Through vivid aquatic imagery, Brooke presents a whimsical and imaginative depiction of a fish's perception of heaven. The poem delves into themes of faith, the unknown, and the ineffable nature of the divine. The fish symbolize creatures seeking meaning and purpose in a world that often feels limited and finite.

The imagery in the poem is rich and evocative, painting a picture of a celestial realm filled with water, mud, and various aquatic creatures. Brooke uses vivid descriptions of "Fat caterpillars drift around" and "Unfading moths, immortal flies" to create a sense of abundance and eternal life in this heavenly realm. The contrast between the mundane and the celestial in the imagery underscores the fish's belief in a paradise beyond their current existence.

### Literary Devices

Brooke employs several literary devices in "Heaven" to convey the themes and imagery of the poem. Alliteration is used in phrases like "secret fishy hope or fear" and "Mud unto mud!" to create a musical quality and enhance the sensory experience of the aquatic world being described. The use of personification, as seen in lines like "And mud, celestially fair," imbues non-human elements with human-like qualities, adding depth to the depiction of the fish's heaven.

The poem also features symbolism, with the fish representing beings seeking transcendence and a deeper understanding of existence. The water and mud symbolize the elements of life and death, while the celestial creatures symbolize eternal life and renewal. Through these devices, Brooke conveys complex philosophical ideas in a playful and imaginative manner.

### Historical and Personal Context

Rupert Brooke, a prominent poet of the early 20th century, was known for his idealistic and patriotic verse. "Heaven" was published posthumously in 1918, after Brooke's death during World War I. The poem reflects Brooke's fascination with themes of mortality, spirituality, and the afterlife, which were likely influenced by the wartime experiences and the existential questions raised by the conflict.

The poem can also be seen as a reflection of the broader cultural and intellectual climate of the time, with an increasing interest in spiritualism and metaphysical exploration. The uncertainties and upheavals of the war may have prompted Brooke to contemplate questions of life, death, and the possibility of an existence beyond the physical realm.

### Deep Reading

"Heaven" can be interpreted as a meditation on the human desire for transcendence and the search for meaning in a world filled with uncertainty and impermanence. The fish in the poem symbolize humanity grappling with the mysteries of existence and yearning for a sense of purpose beyond the limitations of earthly life. The fish's belief in a divine presence that is "Squamous, omnipotent, and kind" reflects a longing for a benevolent higher power that guides and protects them in the afterlife.

The poem's exploration of the afterlife as a watery paradise filled with celestial creatures and eternal renewal suggests a vision of heaven that is both fantastical and comforting. Through the whimsical and imaginative portrayal of the fish's beliefs, Brooke invites readers to contemplate their own beliefs about the nature of existence and the possibility of a transcendent reality beyond what can be known or understood.

In conclusion, "Heaven" offers a thought-provoking and imaginative exploration of faith, eternity, and the mysteries of the afterlife. Through its rich imagery, literary devices, and thematic depth, the poem prompts readers to consider the profound questions of existence and the eternal search for meaning in a vast and unknowable universe.

## Winter Song by Wilfred Owen

```
The browns, the olives, and the yellows died,
And were swept up to heaven; where they glowed
Each dawn and set of sun till Christmastide,
And when the land lay pale for them, pale-snowed,
Fell back, and down the snow-drifts flamed and flowed.

From off your face, into the winds of winter,
The sun-brown and the summer-gold are blowing;
But they shall gleam with spiritual glinter,
When paler beauty on your brows falls snowing,
And through those snows my looks shall be soft-going.
```

## Lines Written In Early Spring by William Wordsworth

```
I heard a thousand blended notes,
While in a grove I sate reclined,
In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts
Bring sad thoughts to the mind.

To her fair works did Nature link
The human soul that through me ran;
And much it grieved my heart to think
What man has made of man.

Through primrose tufts, in that green bower,
The periwinkle trailed its wreaths;
And 'tis my faith that every flower
Enjoys the air it breathes.

The birds around me hopped and played,
Their thoughts I cannot measure:--
But the least motion which they made
It seemed a thrill of pleasure.

The budding twigs spread out their fan,
To catch the breezy air;
And I must think, do all I can,
That there was pleasure there.

If this belief from heaven be sent,
If such be Nature's holy plan,
Have I not reason to lament
What man has made of man?
```
