## Roses by Joyce Kilmer

```
(For Katherine Bregy)

I went to gather roses and twine them in a ring,
For I would make a posy, a posy for the King.
I got an hundred roses, the loveliest there be,
From the white rose vine and the pink rose bush and from the red
rose tree.
But when I took my posy and laid it at His feet
I found He had His roses a million times more sweet.
There was a scarlet blossom upon each foot and hand,
And a great pink rose bloomed from His side for the healing of the
land.
Now of this fair and awful King there is this marvel told,
That He wears a crown of linked thorns instead of one of gold.
Where there are thorns are roses, and I saw a line of red,
A little wreath of roses around His radiant head.
A red rose is His Sacred Heart, a white rose is His face,
And His breath has turned the barren world to a rich and flowery
place.
He is the Rose of Sharon, His gardener am I,
And I shall drink His fragrance in Heaven when I die.
```

### Themes and Imagery

One of the central themes of the poem is the contrast between earthly beauty, represented by the roses gathered by the speaker, and divine beauty embodied by the King. The roses symbolize human efforts to offer something beautiful to the King, but they pale in comparison to the beauty and sacrifice of the King himself. The imagery of the roses, particularly the scarlet blossom on the King's foot and hand, and the pink rose blooming from His side, conveys the idea of divine love and redemption.

The poem also explores themes of sacrifice, redemption, and the transformative power of love.

### Literary Devices

Kilmer employs various literary devices to enhance the poem's meaning and imagery. The use of symbolism is prominent throughout the poem, with the roses symbolizing human offerings and the King's wounds symbolizing His sacrifice and love. The repetition of the word "roses" emphasizes their significance in relation to the King's own beauty and sacrifice.

The imagery of the roses, thorns, and crown creates a vivid picture of the King's suffering and glory. The metaphor of the King as the "Rose of Sharon" and the speaker as His gardener conveys a sense of intimacy and devotion in their relationship. The personification of the King's breath turning the world into a "rich and flowery place" adds a mystical and transformative element to the poem.

The contrast between the earthly roses gathered by the speaker and the King's own sacrificial roses highlights the inadequacy of human offerings in comparison to the King's boundless love.

The image of the King wearing a crown of thorns, traditionally associated with His crucifixion, reinforces the theme of sacrifice and suffering as essential components of divine love. The transformation of the barren world into a "rich and flowery place" through the King's presence suggests a vision of renewal and abundance that transcends human understanding.

Overall, "Roses" invites readers to contemplate the profound mystery of divine love and sacrifice, symbolized by the King's beauty and wounds. Kilmer's poetic exploration of these themes through vivid imagery and lyrical language offers a glimpse into the transcendent nature of faith and the transformative power of love.

## Before The Paling Of The Stars by Christina Rossetti

```
Before the winter morn,
Before the earliest cock crow,
Jesus Christ was born:
Born in a stable,
Cradled in a manger,
In the world his hands had made
Born a stranger.

Priest and king lay fast asleep
In Jerusalem;
Young and old lay fast asleep
In crowded Bethlehem;
Saint and angel, ox and ass,
Kept a watch together
Before the Christmas daybreak
In the winter weather.

Jesus on his mother's breast
In the stable cold,
Spotless lamb of God was he,
Shepherd of the fold:
Let us kneel with Mary maid,
With Joseph bent and hoary,
With saint and angel, ox and ass,
To hail the King of Glory.
```

Like one that fed on awe.
More prudent to assault the dawn
Than merit the ethereal scorn
That effervesced from her.
