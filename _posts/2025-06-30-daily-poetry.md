## Before The Paling Of The Stars by Christina Rossetti

```
Before the winter morn,
Before the earliest cock crow,
Jesus Christ was born:
Born in a stable,
Cradled in a manger,
In the world his hands had made
Born a stranger.

Priest and king lay fast asleep
In Jerusalem;
Young and old lay fast asleep
In crowded Bethlehem;
Saint and angel, ox and ass,
Kept a watch together
Before the Christmas daybreak
In the winter weather.

Jesus on his mother's breast
In the stable cold,
Spotless lamb of God was he,
Shepherd of the fold:
Let us kneel with Mary maid,
With Joseph bent and hoary,
With saint and angel, ox and ass,
To hail the King of Glory.
```

## A Thought For A Lonely Death-Bed by Elizabeth Barrett Browning

```
IF God compel thee to this destiny,
To die alone, with none beside thy bed
To ruffle round with sobs thy last word said
And mark with tears the pulses ebb from thee,--
Pray then alone, ' O Christ, come tenderly !
By thy forsaken Sonship in the red
Drear wine-press,--by the wilderness out-spread,--
And the lone garden where thine agony
Fell bloody from thy brow,--by all of those
Permitted desolations, comfort mine !
No earthly friend being near me, interpose
No deathly angel 'twixt my face aud thine,
But stoop Thyself to gather my life's rose,
And smile away my mortal to Divine !
```

The image of Christ gathering the speaker's "life's rose" and transforming their mortal existence into something divine conveys a sense of spiritual reassurance and redemption.

### Literary Devices

Browning employs various literary devices to enhance the emotional impact of the poem. The repetition of the word "alone" in the first line emphasizes the speaker's isolated state. Alliteration is used effectively in phrases like "ruffle round with sobs" and "pulses ebb," creating a sense of melancholy and inevitability. The speaker's plea to Christ is marked by apostrophe, addressing him directly despite his physical absence. The imagery of the "wilderness out-spread" and the "bloody brow" adds vividness to the religious allusions and underscores the intensity of Christ's suffering.

### Historical and Personal Context

## A Door just opened on a street -- by Emily Dickinson

A Door just opened on a street --
I -- lost -- was passing by --

Lost doubly -- but by contrast -- most --
Informing -- misery --
