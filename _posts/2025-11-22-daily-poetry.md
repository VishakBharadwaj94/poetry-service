## Fragment: A Wanderer by Percy Bysshe Shelley

```
He wanders, like a day-appearing dream,
Through the dim wildernesses of the mind;
Through desert woods and tracts, which seem
Like ocean, homeless, boundless, unconfined.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The imagery of "dim wildernesses of the mind" and "desert woods and tracts" conveys a sense of vastness and emptiness that mirrors the wanderer's inner journey. The comparison of the wilderness to an "ocean, homeless, boundless, unconfined" further emphasizes the idea of endless exploration and discovery.

### Literary Devices

Shelley uses metaphor and simile to create vivid imagery and convey complex emotions. The comparison of the wanderer to a "day-appearing dream" suggests a sense of transience and impermanence. The use of personification in describing the mind as a wilderness adds depth to the poem and enhances the reader's understanding of the wanderer's internal struggles. The repetition of the word "through" in the first two lines emphasizes the continuous and ongoing nature of the wanderer's journey.

## Evening Star by Edgar Allan Poe

```
'Twas noontide of summer,
  And midtime of night,
And stars, in their orbits,
  Shone pale, through the light
Of the brighter, cold moon.
  'Mid planets her slaves,
Herself in the Heavens,
  Her beam on the waves.

  I gazed awhile
  On her cold smile;
Too cold--too cold for me--
  There passed, as a shroud,
  A fleecy cloud,
And I turned away to thee,
  Proud Evening Star,
  In thy glory afar
And dearer thy beam shall be;
  For joy to my heart
  Is the proud part
Thou bearest in Heaven at night,
  And more I admire
  Thy distant fire,
Than that colder, lowly light.
```

This theme of warmth and distance is reflected in the imagery of celestial bodies, with the moon symbolizing detachment and the evening star symbolizing closeness and admiration.

### Literary Devices

Poe employs several literary devices in "Evening Star" to enhance its meaning and impact.

The contrast between the coldness of the moon and the warmth of the evening star underscores the idea that what one finds beautiful and comforting may differ from person to person. Ultimately, the poem invites readers to consider their own definitions of beauty and the significance of personal connections to the world around them.

## This Is No Case of Petty Right or Wrong by Edward Thomas

```
THIS is no case of petty right or wrong
That politicians or philosophers
Can judge. I hate not Germans, nor grow hot
With love of Englishmen, to please newspapers.
Beside my hate for one fat patriot
My hatred of the Kaiser is love true:--
A kind of god he is, banging a gong.
But I have not to choose between the two,
Or between justice and injustice. Dinned
With war and argument I read no more
Than in the storm smoking along the wind
Athwart the wood. Two witches' cauldrons roar.
From one the weather shall rise clear and gay;
Out of the other an England beautiful
And like her mother that died yesterday.
Little I know or care if, being dull,
I shall miss something that historians
Can rake out of the ashes when perchance
The phoenix broods serene above their ken.
But with the best and meanest Englishmen
I am one in crying, God save England, lest
We lose what never slaves and cattle blessed.
The ages made her that made us from the dust:
She is all we know and live by, and we trust
She is good and must endure, loving her so:
And as we love ourselves we hate her foe.
```
