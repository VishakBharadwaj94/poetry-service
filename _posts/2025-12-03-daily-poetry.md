## Israfel by Edgar Allan Poe

```
In Heaven a spirit doth dwell
  "Whose heart-strings are a lute;"
None sing so wildly well
As the angel Israfel,
And the giddy Stars (so legends tell),
Ceasing their hymns, attend the spell
  Of his voice, all mute.

Tottering above
  In her highest noon,
  The enamoured Moon
Blushes with love,
  While, to listen, the red levin
  (With the rapid Pleiads, even,
  Which were seven),
  Pauses in Heaven.

And they say (the starry choir
  And the other listening things)
That Israfeli's fire
Is owing to that lyre
  By which he sits and sings--
The trembling living wire
Of those unusual strings.

But the skies that angel trod,
  Where deep thoughts are a duty--
Where Love's a grow-up God--
  Where the Houri glances are
Imbued with all the beauty
  Which we worship in a star.

Therefore, thou art not wrong,
  Israfeli, who despisest
An unimpassioned song;
To thee the laurels belong,
  Best bard, because the wisest!
Merrily live and long!

The ecstasies above
  With thy burning measures suit--
Thy grief, thy joy, thy hate, thy love,
  With the fervor of thy lute--
  Well may the stars be mute!

Yes, Heaven is thine; but this
  Is a world of sweets and sours;
  Our flowers are merely--flowers,
And the shadow of thy perfect bliss
  Is the sunshine of ours.

If I could dwell
Where Israfel
  Hath dwelt, and he where I,
He might not sing so wildly well
  A mortal melody,
While a bolder note than this might swell
  From my lyre within the sky.
```

The first stanza has seven lines, the second and third stanzas have six lines each, and the fourth, fifth, and sixth stanzas have four lines each. This irregular structure adds to the musicality of the poem, echoing the theme of music and singing that runs throughout. The irregular line lengths also contribute to a sense of fluidity and movement, mirroring the ethereal and mystical nature of the angel Israfel.

In terms of meter, the poem does not strictly adhere to a specific pattern. However, there are instances of trochaic and iambic rhythms, reflecting the fluctuating emotions and intensity of the subject matter. The rhyme scheme is also irregular, with a mix of end rhymes and internal rhymes that enhance the lyrical quality of the poem.

### Themes and Imagery

One of the central themes of the poem is the power of music and its ability to evoke intense emotions. The angel Israfel is portrayed as a masterful musician whose singing is so captivating that even the stars fall silent to listen. This theme of music as a transcendent force is reinforced through vivid imagery, such as the moon blushing with love and the stars pausing in heaven to hear Israfel's song.

The poem also explores the contrast between the celestial realm of Israfel and the earthly world. While Israfel dwells in a realm of pure beauty and passion, the speaker acknowledges the imperfections and limitations of the human experience. This contrast is illustrated through imagery of flowers and shadows, symbolizing the fleeting nature of earthly pleasures compared to the eternal bliss of Israfel's world.

### Literary Devices

Poe employs several literary devices to enhance the poetic quality of the poem. One notable device is personification, as Israfel is depicted as a celestial being with human-like emotions and talents. The use of imagery, such as the personification of the moon and stars, creates a vivid and mystical atmosphere that immerses the reader in the world of the poem.

Another important device is symbolism, particularly in the references to Israfel's lyre as a source of his fiery inspiration. The lyre symbolizes creativity and passion, highlighting the transformative power of art and music. Additionally, the use of alliteration and assonance in phrases like "trembling living wire" and "grief, joy, hate, love" adds musicality to the poem and reinforces its thematic focus on music and emotion.

### Historical and Personal Context

Written in the mid-19th century, "Israfel" reflects Edgar Allan Poe's fascination with themes of beauty, love, and the supernatural. Poe's own struggles with loss and despair are echoed in the poem's exploration of heavenly ecstasy and earthly imperfection. The poem also draws on Poe's interest in music and its ability to convey emotions beyond words, a theme that recurs in many of his works.

Poe's use of romantic imagery and symbolism aligns with the literary trends of the Romantic era, which emphasized emotion, nature, and the supernatural. The reference to Israfel as the "best bard, because the wisest" suggests Poe's admiration for artists who can channel profound emotions and insights through their creative endeavors.

### Deep Reading

At its core, "Israfel" is a meditation on the transformative power of art and the eternal pursuit of beauty and truth. Through the figure of Israfel, Poe explores the idea of the artist as a divine messenger, capable of transcending earthly limitations through the sheer force of creativity and passion. The poem's ethereal imagery and musical language invite the reader to contemplate the ineffable nature of beauty and the longing for spiritual connection.

Ultimately, "Israfel" serves as a tribute to the artistic impulse and the enduring quest for transcendence in a world marked by impermanence and imperfection. Poe's evocative language and imaginative vision create a haunting and mesmerizing portrait of the angel Israfel, whose music echoes through the heavens and stirs the souls of all who hear it.

## Thanksgiving by Joyce Kilmer

```
(For John Bunker)

The roar of the world is in my ears.
Thank God for the roar of the world!
Thank God for the mighty tide of fears
Against me always hurled!
Thank God for the bitter and ceaseless strife,
And the sting of His chastening rod!
Thank God for the stress and the pain of life,
And Oh, thank God for God!
```
