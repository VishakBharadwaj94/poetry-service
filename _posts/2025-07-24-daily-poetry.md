## The Haunted Palace by Edgar Allan Poe

```
In the greenest of our valleys
  By good angels tenanted,
Once a fair and stately palace--
  Radiant palace--reared its head.
In the monarch Thought's dominion--
  It stood there!
Never seraph spread a pinion
  Over fabric half so fair!

Banners yellow, glorious, golden,
  On its roof did float and flow,
(This--all this--was in the olden
  Time long ago),
And every gentle air that dallied,
  In that sweet day,
Along the ramparts plumed and pallid,
  A winged odor went away.

Wanderers in that happy valley,
  Through two luminous windows, saw
Spirits moving musically,
  To a lute's well-tunÃ«d law,
Bound about a throne where, sitting
  (Porphyrogene!)
In state his glory well befitting,
  The ruler of the realm was seen.

And all with pearl and ruby glowing
  Was the fair palace door,
Through which came flowing, flowing, flowing,
  And sparkling evermore,
A troop of Echoes, whose sweet duty
  Was but to sing,
In voices of surpassing beauty,
  The wit and wisdom of their king.

But evil things, in robes of sorrow,
  Assailed the monarch's high estate.
(Ah, let us mourn!--for never morrow
  Shall dawn upon him desolate !)
And round about his home the glory
  That blushed and bloomed,
Is but a dim-remembered story
  Of the old time entombed.

And travellers, now, within that valley,
  Through the red-litten windows see
Vast forms, that move fantastically
  To a discordant melody,
  While, like a ghastly rapid river,
  Through the pale door
A hideous throng rush out forever
  And laugh--but smile no more.
```

## A Birthday by Christina Rossetti

```
My heart is like a singing bird
Whose nest is in a water'd shoot;
My heart is like an apple-tree
Whose boughs are bent with thickset fruit;
My heart is like a rainbow shell
That paddles in a halcyon sea;
My heart is gladder than all these
Because my love is come to me.

Raise me a dais of silk and down;
Hang it with vair and purple dyes;
Carve it in doves and pomegranates,
And peacocks with a hundred eyes;
Work it in gold and silver grapes,
In leaves and silver fleurs-de-lys;
Because the birthday of my life
Is come, my love is come to me.
```

## The Night is Darkening Around Me by Emily Bronte

```
The night is darkening round me,
The wild winds coldly blow ;
But a tyrant spell has bound me,
And I cannot, cannot go.

The giant trees are bending
Their bare boughs weighed with snow ;
The storm is fast descending,
And yet I cannot go.

Clouds beyond clouds above me,
Wastes beyond wastes below ;
But nothing drear can move me :
I will not, cannot go.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme
Emily Bronte's poem "The Night is Darkening Around Me" consists of three stanzas, each with four lines.

This theme is reinforced through the imagery of the darkening night, cold winds, giant trees bending under snow, and descending storm. These images create a sense of foreboding and isolation, reflecting the speaker's emotional state. The repetition of the phrase "I cannot go" emphasizes the speaker's helplessness and the overwhelming nature of the situation.

The imagery of "clouds beyond clouds above me, wastes beyond wastes below" conveys a sense of vastness and desolation, highlighting the speaker's feeling of being surrounded by insurmountable obstacles. The use of nature imagery throughout the poem adds to the overall atmosphere of melancholy and despair.

### Literary Devices

### Historical and Personal Context
Emily Bronte, known for her novel "Wuthering Heights," wrote this poem during the 19th century, a time when Romanticism was a dominant literary movement. The themes of nature, emotion, and isolation present in the poem reflect common Romantic ideals, as well as Bronte's own personal experiences and emotions.

Bronte's personal life was marked by tragedy and loss, which may have influenced the melancholic tone of the poem. Additionally, the restrictive societal norms of the time, particularly for women, could have contributed to the theme of feeling trapped or bound by external forces.

### Deep Reading
On a deeper level, "The Night is Darkening Around Me" can be interpreted as a metaphor for the internal struggles and emotional turmoil that the speaker is experiencing. The darkness, cold winds, and storm could symbolize the speaker's inner turmoil and the overwhelming emotions that are weighing them down. The inability to move forward or escape could represent a sense of being stuck in a difficult situation or trapped by one's own thoughts and feelings.

The repeated refusal to go despite the harsh conditions could suggest a sense of resignation or acceptance of one's fate. The speaker's defiance in the face of adversity adds a layer of complexity to the poem, implying a stubbornness or determination to withstand hardship even when it seems insurmountable.

Overall, "The Night is Darkening Around Me" is a poignant exploration of emotional struggle, isolation, and resilience, showcasing Bronte's skill in capturing complex human emotions through vivid imagery and lyrical language.
