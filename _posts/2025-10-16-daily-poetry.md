## Lines Written In Early Spring by William Wordsworth

```
I heard a thousand blended notes,
While in a grove I sate reclined,
In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts
Bring sad thoughts to the mind.

To her fair works did Nature link
The human soul that through me ran;
And much it grieved my heart to think
What man has made of man.

Through primrose tufts, in that green bower,
The periwinkle trailed its wreaths;
And 'tis my faith that every flower
Enjoys the air it breathes.

The birds around me hopped and played,
Their thoughts I cannot measure:--
But the least motion which they made
It seemed a thrill of pleasure.

The budding twigs spread out their fan,
To catch the breezy air;
And I must think, do all I can,
That there was pleasure there.

If this belief from heaven be sent,
If such be Nature's holy plan,
Have I not reason to lament
What man has made of man?
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

"Lines Written In Early Spring" by William Wordsworth is a lyric poem consisting of four quatrains with a rhyme scheme of ABAB. The poem does not strictly adhere to a specific meter, but it flows in iambic tetrameter for the most part, giving it a musical quality. The regular rhyme scheme and the consistent use of four-line stanzas create a sense of unity and balance in the poem. This structured form contrasts with the natural imagery and the contemplative tone of the poem, emphasizing the juxtaposition between the chaos of human existence and the tranquility of nature.

### Themes and Imagery

The central themes in the poem are the beauty of nature, the impact of human actions on the natural world, and the contrast between the innocence of nature and the corruption of humanity. Wordsworth uses vivid imagery to evoke the beauty of springtime - the blended notes of birds, the blooming flowers, and the playful birds all contribute to a sense of vibrant life. This imagery serves to highlight the purity and joy found in nature, which stands in stark contrast to the destructive nature of human beings. The poem also explores the idea of interconnectedness between humans and nature, suggesting that humans are linked to nature and should be more in tune with its rhythms.

### Literary Devices

Wordsworth employs several literary devices in the poem to convey his message effectively. Personification is used when he suggests that flowers and birds experience pleasure and joy, attributing human emotions to elements of nature. This device serves to emphasize the idea that nature is alive and sentient, capable of experiencing emotions just like humans. The use of paradox is evident in the line "In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts / Bring sad thoughts to the mind," highlighting the complex interplay between joy and sorrow in human experience. Additionally, the repetition of the phrase "What man has made of man" serves as a refrain throughout the poem, underscoring the theme of human destruction and the need for reflection.

### Historical and Personal Context

Wordsworth was a Romantic poet who believed in the power of nature to inspire and uplift the human spirit. This poem reflects his deep connection to the natural world and his concern for the destructive tendencies of industrialization and urbanization during the early 19th century. The Industrial Revolution brought about rapid changes to the landscape and social structure, leading Wordsworth to lament the loss of innocence and harmony in society. His personal experiences living in the Lake District also influenced his poetry, as he found solace and inspiration in the natural beauty of the region.

### Deep Reading

"Lines Written In Early Spring" explores the tension between the beauty and tranquility of nature and the harsh realities of human existence. The speaker's contemplation of the joy and harmony found in nature leads him to question the destructive nature of human behavior. The contrast between the innocence of nature and the corruption of humanity serves as a critique of industrialization and progress, suggesting that humans have strayed from their connection to the natural world. Ultimately, Wordsworth's poem urges readers to reflect on their impact on the environment and to strive for a more harmonious relationship with nature.

## Home-Thoughts, From the Sea by Robert Browning

```
Nobly, nobly, Cape Saint Vincent to the Northwest died away;
Sunset ran, one glorious blood-red, reeking into Cadiz Bay;
Bluish 'mid the burning water, full in face Trafalgar lay;

In the dimmest Northeast distance dawned Gibraltar grand and gray;
"Here and here did England help me: how can I help England?"--say,
Whoso turns as I, this evening, turn to God and pray,
While Jove's planet rises yonder, silent over Africa.
```

Ultimately, the poem invites readers to reflect on their own relationships to home, heritage, and the broader world, prompting them to consider the intersection of personal and collective responsibilities in shaping one's sense of belonging.

## Night is Darkening Around Me, The by Emily Bronte

```
The night is darkening round me,
The wild winds coldly blow ;
But a tyrant spell has bound me,
And I cannot, cannot go.

The giant trees are bending
Their bare boughs weighed with snow ;
The storm is fast descending,
And yet I cannot go.

Clouds beyond clouds above me,
Wastes beyond wastes below ;
But nothing drear can move me :
I will not, cannot go.
```
