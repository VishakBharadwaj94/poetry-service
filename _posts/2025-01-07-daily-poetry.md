## Buried Life, The by Matthew Arnold

```
Light flows our war of mocking words, and yet,
Behold, with tears mine eyes are wet!
I feel a nameless sadness o'er me roll.
Yes, yes, we know that we can jest,
We know, we know that we can smile!
But there's a something in this breast,
To which thy light words bring no rest,
And thy gay smiles no anodyne.
Give me thy hand, and hush awhile,
And turn those limpid eyes on mine,
And let me read there, love! thy inmost soul.

Alas! is even love too weak
To unlock the heart, and let it speak?
Are even lovers powerless to reveal
To one another what indeed they feel?
I knew the mass of men conceal'd
Their thoughts, for fear that if reveal'd
They would by other men be met
With blank indifference, or with blame reproved;
I knew they lived and moved
Trick'd in disguises, alien to the rest
Of men, and alien to themselves--and yet
The same heart beats in every human breast!

But we, my love!--doth a like spell benumb
Our hearts, our voices?--must we too be dumb?

Ah! well for us, if even we,
Even for a moment, can get free
Our heart, and have our lips unchain'd;
For that which seals them hath been deep-ordain'd!

Fate, which foresaw
How frivolous a baby man would be--
By what distractions he would be possess'd,
How he would pour himself in every strife,
And well-nigh change his own identity--
That it might keep from his capricious play
His genuine self, and force him to obey
Even in his own despite his being's law,
Bade through the deep recesses of our breast
The unregarded river of our life
Pursue with indiscernible flow its way;
And that we should not see
The buried stream, and seem to be
Eddying at large in blind uncertainty,
Though driving on with it eternally.

But often, in the world's most crowded streets,
But often, in the din of strife,
There rises an unspeakable desire
After the knowledge of our buried life;
A thirst to spend our fire and restless force
In tracking out our true, original course;
A longing to inquire
Into the mystery of this heart which beats
So wild, so deep in us--to know
Whence our lives come and where they go.
And many a man in his own breast then delves,
But deep enough, alas! none ever mines.
And we have been on many thousand lines,
And we have shown, on each, spirit and power;
But hardly have we, for one little hour,
Been on our own line, have we been ourselves--
Hardly had skill to utter one of all
The nameless feelings that course through our breast,
But they course on for ever unexpress'd.
And long we try in vain to speak and act
Our hidden self, and what we say and do
Is eloquent, is well--but 't#is not true!
And then we will no more be rack'd
With inward striving, and demand
Of all the thousand nothings of the hour
Their stupefying power;
Ah yes, and they benumb us at our call!
Yet still, from time to time, vague and forlorn,
From the soul's subterranean depth upborne
As from an infinitely distant land,
Come airs, and floating echoes, and convey
A melancholy into all our day.
Only--but this is rare--
When a belov{'e}d hand is laid in ours,
When, jaded with the rush and glare
Of the interminable hours,
Our eyes can in another's eyes read clear,
When our world-deafen'd ear
Is by the tones of a loved voice caress'd--
A bolt is shot back somewhere in our breast,
And a lost pulse of feeling stirs again.
The eye sinks inward, and the heart lies plain,
And what we mean, we say, and what we would, we know.
A man becomes aware of his life's flow,
And hears its winding murmur; and he sees
The meadows where it glides, the sun, the breeze.

And there arrives a lull in the hot race
Wherein he doth for ever chase
That flying and elusive shadow, rest.
An air of coolness plays upon his face,
And an unwonted calm pervades his breast.
And then he thinks he knows
The hills where his life rose,
And the sea where it goes.
```

### Analysis

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "The Buried Life" by Matthew Arnold is written in a series of stanzas, each consisting of varying lengths. The poem does not adhere to a specific rhyme scheme, which gives it a sense of freedom and fluidity. The lack of a strict rhyme scheme also mirrors the theme of inner turmoil and the struggle to express one's true self. The meter is predominantly iambic, with lines varying in length and rhythm, contributing to the overall reflective and contemplative tone of the poem.

### Themes and Imagery

One of the central themes of the poem is the idea of the "buried life", the inner self that is often hidden or suppressed beneath societal expectations and pressures. Arnold explores the struggle to express one's true feelings and desires amidst the distractions and superficialities of daily life. The imagery of "light flows our war of mocking words" juxtaposed with tears and a "nameless sadness" conveys the contrast between surface interactions and deeper emotional truths. The use of nature imagery, such as the meadows, sun, and breeze, reflects a longing for authenticity and connection with the natural world.

### Literary Devices

Arnold employs various literary devices throughout the poem to convey its themes. The repetition of phrases like "we know, we know" and "but hardly have we" emphasizes the speaker's frustration and sense of disconnect. The use of alliteration in phrases like "deep in us" and "mystery of this heart" creates a sense of rhythm and musicality. The poem also features imagery, such as the metaphor of the "buried stream" and the idea of a "beloved hand" unlocking emotions, which add depth and complexity to the exploration of inner life.

### Historical and Personal Context

Matthew Arnold was a Victorian poet and critic who often grappled with themes of alienation, disillusionment, and the search for meaning in a rapidly changing world. "The Buried Life" reflects the Romantic and Victorian preoccupation with the inner self, authenticity, and the tension between societal norms and individual desires. Arnold's own struggles with identity and disconnection from his contemporaries likely influenced the introspective and philosophical nature of the poem.

### Deep Reading

At its core, "The Buried Life" delves into the universal human experience of longing for self-discovery and authenticity. The speaker's lamentation over the inability to fully express one's true self resonates with readers who have felt constrained by societal expectations or their own internal barriers. The image of a "lost pulse of feeling" stirring again when in the presence of a loved one speaks to the transformative power of genuine connection and intimacy. Ultimately, the poem invites reflection on the nature of identity, the struggle for self-expression, and the fleeting moments of clarity that offer glimpses into our buried selves.

## Winter Song by Wilfred Owen

```
The browns, the olives, and the yellows died,
And were swept up to heaven; where they glowed
Each dawn and set of sun till Christmastide,
And when the land lay pale for them, pale-snowed,
Fell back, and down the snow-drifts flamed and flowed.

From off your face, into the winds of winter,
The sun-brown and the summer-gold are blowing;
But they shall gleam with spiritual glinter,
When paler beauty on your brows falls snowing,
And through those snows my looks shall be soft-going.
```

The first stanza has seven lines, the second stanza has six lines, and the third stanza has seven lines.

### Themes and Imagery
The themes of nature, change, and beauty are prominent in "Winter Song." The poem explores the cycle of seasons and the transformation of colors from autumn to winter. The imagery of browns, olives, yellows, and snow creates a vivid picture of the changing landscape. The contrast between the warmth of summer and the cold of winter is evoked through descriptions of sun-brown and summer-gold giving way to paler beauty and snow. The imagery of snow-drifts flaming and flowing adds a sense of movement and energy to the scene.

### Literary Devices
Owen employs several literary devices in "Winter Song" to enhance its meaning and impact. Alliteration is used in phrases like "browns, the olives, and the yellows" to create a musical quality. Personification is also present, as colors are described as dying, glowing, and falling back. The use of metaphor is evident in lines like "spiritual glinter" to convey a sense of inner beauty shining through external changes. The repetition of the word "pale" emphasizes the theme of fading colors and the onset of winter.

### Historical and Personal Context
Wilfred Owen was a poet who served in World War I, and his poems often reflect his experiences and observations of the war. While "Winter Song" does not directly address war, it can be seen as a reflection of the themes of change, loss, and beauty that are common in Owen's work. The contrast between the vibrancy of summer colors and the starkness of winter imagery may also suggest a deeper commentary on the fleeting nature of life and the inevitability of change.

### Deep Reading
On a deeper level, "Winter Song" can be interpreted as a meditation on the passage of time and the cycle of life. The transformation of colors from vibrant to pale mirrors the process of aging and the eventual decline of beauty. The shifting seasons symbolize the impermanence of all things, highlighting the bittersweet nature of existence. The poem's emphasis on spiritual beauty suggests a deeper, inner source of light that remains constant even as external appearances change. Overall, "Winter Song" invites readers to contemplate the beauty and transience of the natural world, while also pointing towards a deeper, enduring sense of inner grace.
