## Merry Autumn by Paul Laurence Dunbar

```
It's all a farce,—these tales they tell
  About the breezes sighing,
And moans astir o'er field and dell,
  Because the year is dying.

Such principles are most absurd,—
  I care not who first taught 'em;
There's nothing known to beast or bird
  To make a solemn autumn.

In solemn times, when grief holds sway
  With countenance distressing,
You'll note the more of black and gray
  Will then be used in dressing.

Now purple tints are all around;
  The sky is blue and mellow;
And e'en the grasses turn the ground
  From modest green to yellow.

The seed burs all with laughter crack
  On featherweed and jimson;
And leaves that should be dressed in black
  Are all decked out in crimson.

A butterfly goes winging by;
  A singing bird comes after;
And Nature, all from earth to sky,
  Is bubbling o'er with laughter.

The ripples wimple on the rills,
  Like sparkling little lasses;
The sunlight runs along the hills,
  And laughs among the grasses.

The earth is just so full of fun
  It really can't contain it;
And streams of mirth so freely run
  The heavens seem to rain it.

Don't talk to me of solemn days
  In autumn's time of splendor,
Because the sun shows fewer rays,
  And these grow slant and slender.

Why, it's the climax of the year,—
  The highest time of living!—
Till naturally its bursting cheer
  Just melts into thanksgiving.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "Merry Autumn" by Paul Laurence Dunbar is structured into four quatrains with a consistent ABAB rhyme scheme. The meter is predominantly iambic tetrameter, with lines alternating between four and three stresses. This rhythmic pattern gives the poem a light and playful feel that complements the joyful imagery of autumn that the poet describes.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem is the joy and vibrancy of autumn, which is portrayed as a season of mirth and celebration rather than sorrow and decay. Dunbar challenges traditional notions of autumn as a solemn time of dying by highlighting the beauty and liveliness that can be found in nature during this season. The imagery in the poem is rich and vivid, painting a picture of autumn as a time of vibrant colors, laughter, and abundance. The poet uses descriptions of purple tints, blue skies, yellow grasses, and crimson leaves to evoke a sense of joy and vitality in the reader.

### Literary Devices

Dunbar employs several literary devices to enhance the poem's themes and imagery. One of the most prominent devices is personification, as he personifies nature by describing it as "bubbling o'er with laughter" and "full of fun." This personification adds a sense of liveliness and energy to the natural world. The poet also uses vivid sensory imagery, such as the sound of seed burs cracking with laughter and the sight of sunlight running along the hills, to create a vivid and immersive experience for the reader.

### Historical and Personal Context

Paul Laurence Dunbar was an African American poet who wrote during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a time when racial segregation and discrimination were rampant in the United States. Despite facing significant challenges and obstacles, Dunbar's poetry often celebrated the beauty and resilience of the African American experience. In "Merry Autumn," Dunbar's celebration of the joy and vibrancy of autumn can be seen as a reflection of his own resilience and ability to find joy in the face of adversity.

### Deep Reading

One of the most striking aspects of "Merry Autumn" is the way in which Dunbar challenges traditional perceptions of autumn as a season of sadness and decay. By portraying autumn as a time of celebration and abundance, the poet invites the reader to reconsider their preconceived notions about the season and find joy in the beauty of nature. This subversion of expectations serves as a powerful reminder that beauty and joy can be found in unexpected places, even in the midst of change and transition. In this way, Dunbar's poem encourages us to embrace the beauty and vitality of the present moment, rather than dwelling on the passage of time.

## I Wandered Lonely As A Cloud by William Wordsworth

```
I wandered lonely as a cloud
That floats on high o'er vales and hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
A host, of golden daffodils;
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.

Continuous as the stars that shine
And twinkle on the milky way,
They stretched in never-ending line
Along the margin of a bay:
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.

 The waves beside them danced, but they
Out-did the sparkling leaves in glee;
A poet could not be but gay,
In such a jocund company!
I gazed—and gazed—but little thought
What wealth the show to me had brought:

For oft, when on my couch I lie
In vacant or in pensive mood,
They flash upon that inward eye
Which is the bliss of solitude;
And then my heart with pleasure fills,
And dances with the daffodils.
```

The comparison of the daffodils to stars and the Milky Way highlights their beauty and abundance, emphasizing the transcendental quality of nature.

### Literary Devices

Wordsworth employs several literary devices in the poem, including simile, personification, and imagery. The comparison of the speaker to a cloud in the opening line sets the tone for the speaker's solitary wanderings and contemplative mood. Personifying the daffodils as a "host" and describing them as "dancing" and "fluttering" imbues them with life and energy. The use of simile in comparing the daffodils to stars and the Milky Way enhances their ethereal quality and creates a sense of wonder and awe.

## The Strayed Reveller by Matthew Arnold

```
1 Faster, faster,
2 O Circe, Goddess,
3 Let the wild, thronging train
4 The bright procession
5 Of eddying forms,
6 Sweep through my soul!

7 Thou standest, smiling
8 Down on me! thy right arm,
9 Lean'd up against the column there,
10 Props thy soft cheek;
11 Thy left holds, hanging loosely,
12 The deep cup, ivy-cinctured,
13 I held but now.

14 Is it, then, evening
15 So soon? I see, the night-dews,
16 Cluster'd in thick beads, dim
17 The agate brooch-stones
18 On thy white shoulder;
19 The cool night-wind, too,
20 Blows through the portico,
21 Stirs thy hair, Goddess,
22 Waves thy white robe!

Circe.

23 Whence art thou, sleeper?

The Youth.

24 When the white dawn first
25 Through the rough fir-planks
26 Of my hut, by the chestnuts,
27 Up at the valley-head,
28 Came breaking, Goddess!
29 I sprang up, I threw round me
30 My dappled fawn-skin;
31 Passing out, from the wet turf,
32 Where they lay, by the hut door,
33 I snatch'd up my vine-crown, my fir-staff,
34 All drench'd in dew-
35 Came swift down to join
36 The rout early gather'd
37 In the town, round the temple,
38 Iacchus' white fane
39 On yonder hill.

40 Quick I pass'd, following
41 The wood-cutters' cart-track
42 Down the dark valley;-I saw
43 On my left, through the beeches,
44 Thy palace, Goddess,
45 Smokeless, empty!
46 Trembling, I enter'd; beheld
47 The court all silent,
48 The lions sleeping,
49 On the altar this bowl.
50 I drank, Goddess!
51 And sank down here, sleeping,
52 On the steps of thy portico.

Circe.

53 Foolish boy! Why tremblest thou?
54 Thou lovest it, then, my wine?
55 Wouldst more of it? See, how glows,
56 Through the delicate, flush'd marble,
57 The red, creaming liquor,
58 Strown with dark seeds!
59 Drink, thee! I chide thee not,
60 Deny thee not my bowl.
61 Come, stretch forth thy hand, thee-so!
62 Drink-drink again!

The Youth.

63 Thanks, gracious one!
64 Ah, the sweet fumes again!
65 More soft, ah me,
66 More subtle-winding
67 Than Pan's flute-music!
68 Faint-faint! Ah me,
69 Again the sweet sleep!

Circe.

70 Hist! Thou-within there!
71 Come forth, Ulysses!
72 Art tired with hunting?
73 While we range the woodland,
74 See what the day brings.

Ulysses.

75 Ever new magic!
76 Hast thou then lured hither,
77 Wonderful Goddess, by thy art,
78 The young, languid-eyed Ampelus,
79 Iacchus' darling-
80 Or some youth beloved of Pan,
81 Of Pan and the Nymphs?
82 That he sits, bending downward
83 His white, delicate neck
84 To the ivy-wreathed marge
85 Of thy cup; the bright, glancing vine-leaves
86 That crown his hair,
87 Falling forward, mingling
88 With the dark ivy-plants--
89 His fawn-skin, half untied,
90 Smear'd with red wine-stains? Who is he,
91 That he sits, overweigh'd
92 By fumes of wine and sleep,
93 So late, in thy portico?
94 What youth, Goddess,-what guest
95 Of Gods or mortals?

Circe.

96 Hist! he wakes!
97 I lured him not hither, Ulysses.
98 Nay, ask him!

The Youth.

99 Who speaks' Ah, who comes forth
100 To thy side, Goddess, from within?
101 How shall I name him?
102 This spare, dark-featured,
103 Quick-eyed stranger?
104 Ah, and I see too
105 His sailor's bonnet,
106 His short coat, travel-tarnish'd,
107 With one arm bare!--
108 Art thou not he, whom fame
109 This long time rumours
110 The favour'd guest of Circe, brought by the waves?
111 Art thou he, stranger?
112 The wise Ulysses,
113 Laertes' son?

Ulysses.

114 I am Ulysses.
115 And thou, too, sleeper?
116 Thy voice is sweet.
117 It may be thou hast follow'd
118 Through the islands some divine bard,
119 By age taught many things,
120 Age and the Muses;
121 And heard him delighting
122 The chiefs and people
123 In the banquet, and learn'd his songs.
124 Of Gods and Heroes,
125 Of war and arts,
126 And peopled cities,
127 Inland, or built
128 By the gray sea.-If so, then hail!
129 I honour and welcome thee.

The Youth.

130 The Gods are happy.
131 They turn on all sides
132 Their shining eyes,
133 And see below them
134 The earth and men.

135 They see Tiresias
136 Sitting, staff in hand,
137 On the warm, grassy
138 Asopus bank,
139 His robe drawn over
140 His old sightless head,
141 Revolving inly
142 The doom of Thebes.

143 They see the Centaurs
144 In the upper glens
145 Of Pelion, in the streams,
146 Where red-berried ashes fringe
147 The clear-brown shallow pools,
148 With streaming flanks, and heads
149 Rear'd proudly, snuffing
150 The mountain wind.

151 They see the Indian
152 Drifting, knife in hand,
153 His frail boat moor'd to
154 A floating isle thick-matted
155 With large-leaved, low-creeping melon-plants
156 And the dark cucumber.

157 He reaps, and stows them,
158 Drifting--drifting;--round him,
159 Round his green harvest-plot,
160 Flow the cool lake-waves,
161 The mountains ring them.

162 They see the Scythian
163 On the wide stepp, unharnessing
164 His wheel'd house at noon.
165 He tethers his beast down, and makes his meal--
166 Mares' milk, and bread
167 Baked on the embers;--all around
168 The boundless, waving grass-plains stretch, thick-starr'd
169 With saffron and the yellow hollyhock
170 And flag-leaved iris-flowers.
171 Sitting in his cart
172 He makes his meal; before him, for long miles,
173 Alive with bright green lizards,
174 And the springing bustard-fowl,
175 The track, a straight black line,
176 Furrows the rich soil; here and there
177 Cluster of lonely mounds
178 Topp'd with rough-hewn,
179 Gray, rain-blear'd statues, overpeer
180 The sunny waste.

181 They see the ferry
182 On the broad, clay-laden
183 Lone Chorasmian stream;--thereon,
184 With snort and strain,
185 Two horses, strongly swimming, tow
186 The ferry-boat, with woven ropes
187 To either bow
188 Firm harness'd by the mane; a chief
189 With shout and shaken spear,
190 Stands at the prow, and guides them; but astern
191 The cowering merchants, in long robes,
192 Sit pale beside their wealth
193 Of silk-bales and of balsam-drops,
194 Of gold and ivory,
195 Of turquoise-earth and amethyst,
196 Jasper and chalcedony,
197 And milk-barred onyx-stones.
198 The loaded boat swings groaning
199 In the yellow eddies;
200 The Gods behold him.

201 They see the Heroes
202 Sitting in the dark ship
203 On the foamless, long-heaving
204 Violet sea.
205 At sunset nearing
206 The Happy Islands.

207 These things, Ulysses,
208 The wise bards, also
209 Behold and sing.
210 But oh, what labour!
211 O prince, what pain!
212 They too can see
213 Tiresias;--but the Gods,
214 Who give them vision,
215 Added this law:
216 That they should bear too
217 His groping blindness,
218 His dark foreboding,
219 His scorn'd white hairs;
220 Bear Hera's anger
221 Through a life lengthen'd
222 To seven ages.

223 They see the Centaurs
224 On Pelion:--then they feel,
225 They too, the maddening wine
226 Swell their large veins to bursting; in wild pain
227 They feel the biting spears
228 Of the grim Lapithж, and Theseus, drive,
229 Drive crashing through their bones; they feel
230 High on a jutting rock in the red stream
231 Alcmena's dreadful son
232 Ply his bow;--such a price
233 The Gods exact for song:
234 To become what we sing.

235 They see the Indian
236 On his mountain lake; but squalls
237 Make their skiff reel, and worms
238 In the unkind spring have gnawn
239 Their melon-harvest to the heart.--They see
240 The Scythian: but long frosts
241 Parch them in winter-time on the bare stepp,
242 Till they too fade like grass; they crawl
243 Like shadows forth in spring.

244 They see the merchants
245 On the Oxus stream;--but care
246 Must visit first them too, and make them pale.
247 Whether, through whirling sand,
248 A cloud of desert robber-horse have burst
249 Upon their caravan; or greedy kings,
250 In the wall'd cities the way passes through,
251 Crush'd them with tolls; or fever-airs,
252 On some great river's marge,
253 Mown them down, far from home.

254 They see the Heroes
255 Near harbour;--but they share
256 Their lives, and former violent toil in Thebes,
257 Seven-gated Thebes, or Troy;
258 Or where the echoing oars
259 Of Argo first
260 Startled the unknown sea.

261 The old Silenus
262 Came, lolling in the sunshine,
263 From the dewy forest-coverts,
264 This way at noon.
265 Sitting by me, while his Fauns
266 Down at the water-side
267 Sprinkled and smoothed
268 His drooping garland,
269 He told me these things.

270 But I, Ulysses,
271 Sitting on the warm steps,
272 Looking over the valley,
273 All day long, have seen,
274 Without pain, without labour,
275 Sometimes a wild-hair'd Mжnad--
276 Sometimes a Faun with torches--
277 And sometimes, for a moment,
278 Passing through the dark stems
279 Flowing-robed, the beloved,
280 The desired, the divine,
281 Beloved Iacchus.

282 Ah, cool night-wind, tremulous stars!
283 Ah, glimmering water,
284 Fitful earth-murmur,
285 Dreaming woods!
286 Ah, golden-haired, strangely smiling Goddess,
287 And thou, proved, much enduring,
288 Wave-toss'd Wanderer!
289 Who can stand still?
290 Ye fade, ye swim, ye waver before me--
291 The cup again!

292 Faster, faster,
293 O Circe, Goddess.
294 Let the wild, thronging train,
295 The bright procession
296 Of eddying forms,
297 Sweep through my soul!
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "The Strayed Reveller" by Matthew Arnold is written in free verse, without a strict rhyme scheme or meter. The lack of a specific rhyme scheme or meter allows for a more natural flow of language, which complements the dream-like and introspective nature of the poem. 

The poem is divided into three distinct sections: the first section where the youth is addressed by Circe, the second section where Ulysses enters the scene, and the final section where the youth reflects on his experiences. This division helps to structure the narrative and create a sense of progression within the poem.

### Themes and Imagery

One of the main themes of the poem is the exploration of the relationship between mortals and the divine. Through the interactions between Circe, Ulysses, and the youth, the poem delves into the intoxicating allure of the divine and the consequences of seeking out divine experiences. The imagery of wine, sleep, and wild revelry evokes a sense of hedonism and abandonment to pleasure, contrasting with the more sobering presence of Ulysses and the reminder of mortal limitations.

The poem also explores the transient nature of human experience and the fleeting beauty of life. The imagery of nature, such as the night-wind, stars, and water, creates a sense of ephemeral beauty that is both captivating and elusive. The contrast between the wild, thronging train of revelers and the stillness of the night highlights the fleeting nature of joy and the inevitability of change.

### Literary Devices

Arnold employs several literary devices throughout the poem to enhance its themes and imagery. One prominent device is personification, as seen in the depiction of Circe as a goddess who tempts the youth with wine and sleep. This personification adds a mystical and otherworldly quality to the poem, emphasizing the allure of the divine.

The use of vivid sensory imagery, such as the description of the night-dews clustering in thick beads and the cool night-wind blowing through the portico, creates a rich and immersive experience for the reader. These sensory details help to evoke a dream-like atmosphere and draw the reader into the scene.

Arnold also utilizes allusion to classical mythology, referencing figures such as Circe, Ulysses, and Iacchus. These allusions add depth to the poem and contribute to its exploration of themes related to the ancient world and the interactions between mortals and gods.

### Historical and Personal Context

Matthew Arnold was a Victorian poet and critic who often grappled with themes of culture, society, and the human condition in his work. "The Strayed Reveller" reflects Arnold's interest in classical literature and mythology, as well as his exploration of the tensions between reason and emotion, duty and pleasure. The poem can be seen as a meditation on the conflict between worldly desires and higher ideals, a common theme in Arnold's poetry.

The Victorian era was marked by significant social and cultural changes, including industrialization, urbanization, and shifts in religious beliefs. Arnold's poetry often reflects the anxieties and uncertainties of this period, as well as a longing for a deeper connection to the past and to timeless truths. "The Strayed Reveller" can be read as a response to the complexities of Victorian society and a search for meaning and authenticity in a rapidly changing world.

### Deep Reading

In a deeper analysis of "The Strayed Reveller," it becomes evident that the poem is not just a simple narrative but a complex exploration of human desires and limitations. The youth's encounter with Circe and Ulysses can be seen as symbolic of the eternal struggle between indulgence and restraint, pleasure and responsibility.

The poem raises questions about the nature of divine experiences and the consequences of seeking out transcendence. Circe's offer of wine and sleep represents a seductive escape from reality, while Ulysses' presence serves as a reminder of the harsh realities of mortal life. The youth's moment of reflection at the end of the poem suggests a recognition of the transient nature of pleasure and the need to find balance between earthly desires and spiritual fulfillment.

Overall, "The Strayed Reveller" is a nuanced and thought-provoking exploration of human nature, the divine, and the complexities of existence. Through its rich imagery, literary devices, and thematic depth, the poem invites readers to contemplate the eternal themes of pleasure, duty, and the search for meaning in a changing world.
