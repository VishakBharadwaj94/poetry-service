## Instans Tyrannus by Robert Browning

```
Of the million or two, more or less,
I rule and possess,
One man, for some cause undefined,
Was least to my mind.

I struck him, he grovelled of course--
For, what was his force?
I pinned him to earth with my weight
And persistence of hate;
And he lay, would not moan, would not curse,
As his lot might be worse.

"Were the object less mean? would he stand
At the swing of my hand!
For obscurity helps him, and blots
The hole where he squats."
So, I set my five wits on the stretch.
To inveigle the wretch.
All in vain! Gold and jewels I threw,
Still he couched there perdue;
I tempted his blood and his flesh,
Hid in roses my mesh,
Choicest cates and the flagon's best spilth:
Still he kept to his filth.

Had he kith now or kin, were access
To his heart, did I press:
Just a son or a mother to seize!
No such booty as these.
Were it simply a friend to pursue
'Mid my million or two,
Who could pay me, in person or pelf,
What he owes me himself!
No: I could not but smile thro' my chafe:
For the fellow lay safe
As his mates do, the midge and the nit,
--Thro' minuteness, to wit.

Then a humour more great took its place
At the thought of his face:
The droop, the low cares of the mouth,
The trouble uncouth
'Twixt the brows, all that air one is fain
To put out of its pain,
And, "no!" I admonished myself,
"Is one mocked by an elf.
Is one baffled by toad or by rat?
The gravamen's in that!
How the lion, who crouches to suit
His back to my foot,
Would admire that I stand in debate!
But the small turns the great
If it vexes you,--that is the thing!
Toad or rat vex the king?
Tho' I waste half my realm to unearth
Toad or rat, 'tis well worth!"

So, I soberly laid my last plan
To extinguish the man.
Round his creep-hole, with never a break
Ran my fires for his sake;
Overhead, did my thunder combine
With my under-ground mine:
Till I looked from my labour content
To enjoy the event.

When sudden ... how think ye, the end?
Did I say "without friend?"
Say rather, from marge to blue marge
The whole sky grew his targe
With the sun's self for visible boss,
While an Arm ran across
Which the earth heaved beneath like a breast!
Where the wretch was safe prest!
Do you see! Just my vengeance complete,
The man sprang to his feet,
Stood erect, caught at God's skirts, and prayed!
--So,I_ was afraid!
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

This lack of a formal structure mirrors the chaotic and erratic thoughts of the speaker as he narrates his actions and emotions. The irregular meter adds to the sense of unease and unpredictability in the poem, reflecting the inner turmoil of the tyrant speaker.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem is power and its limitations. The speaker, a tyrant, attempts to exert control over a seemingly insignificant man, only to realize that his power is ultimately futile. The imagery of the man's resilience in the face of oppression serves as a metaphor for the indomitable human spirit. The imagery of the tyrant's failed attempts to subjugate the man, using gold, jewels, and other temptations, highlights the emptiness of material wealth in the face of inner strength.

### Literary Devices

Browning employs several literary devices in the poem, including personification, metaphor, and irony. The personification of the man as a symbol of defiance and resilience enhances the contrast between the tyrant's power and the man's inner strength. The metaphor of the man catching "at God's skirts" emphasizes his spiritual resilience and ability to transcend earthly oppression. The irony in the speaker's realization of his own fear and powerlessness underscores the theme of the limitations of tyranny.

### Historical and Personal Context

Robert Browning wrote "Instans Tyrannus" during a period of political upheaval and social change in Europe. The poem reflects Browning's engagement with themes of power, oppression, and resistance, which were prevalent in the political climate of his time. Browning's personal experiences with social and political issues likely influenced his exploration of these themes in his poetry.

### Deep Reading

The poem can be interpreted as a commentary on the nature of power and the hubris of tyrants. The speaker's gradual realization of his own limitations and the ultimate triumph of the man he seeks to oppress suggest a moral lesson about the futility of tyranny. The image of the man standing upright and turning to God for strength symbolizes the victory of the human spirit over oppressive forces. Ultimately, the poem serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of unchecked power and the resilience of the human soul in the face of adversity.

## Life's Tragedy by Paul Laurence Dunbar

```
It may be misery not to sing at all,
And to go silent through the brimming day;
It may be misery never to be loved,
But deeper griefs than these beset the way.

To sing the perfect song,
And by a half-tone lost the key,
There the potent sorrow, there the grief,
The pale, sad staring of Life's Tragedy.

To have come near to the perfect love,
Not the hot passion of untempered youth,
But that which lies aside its vanity,
And gives, for thy trusting worship, truth.

This, this indeed is to be accursed,
For if we mortals love, or if we sing,
We count our joys not by what we have,
But by what kept us from that perfect thing.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

In "Life's Tragedy," Paul Laurence Dunbar utilizes a consistent ABAB rhyme scheme throughout the poem, creating a sense of flow and cohesion. The poem consists of four quatrains, each containing four lines. The structured form of the poem reflects the poet's contemplation of life's complexities and tragedies. In terms of meter, Dunbar employs a mix of iambic tetrameter and iambic trimeter, adding a rhythmic quality to the verses. The variation in meter helps to emphasize certain key phrases and ideas, such as the contrast between the perfect love and the hot passion of youth.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem revolves around the idea of missed opportunities, unattainable perfection, and the melancholy that accompanies such experiences. Through vivid imagery, Dunbar paints a picture of the pain and sorrow that come from not reaching one's potential in love or art. The imagery of singing and music symbolizes expression and emotional fulfillment, while the references to love convey a sense of longing and regret. The poem's title, "Life's Tragedy," encapsulates the overarching theme of the inevitable disappointments and sorrows that life brings.

### Literary Devices

Dunbar employs several literary devices to enhance the emotional impact of the poem. One notable device is repetition, as seen in the repetition of the word "misery" in the first stanza, emphasizing the various forms of sorrow that may afflict individuals. The use of alliteration in phrases like "perfect passion" and "pale, sad staring" adds a musical quality to the verses and draws attention to key ideas. Additionally, the contrast between the "perfect love" and the "hot passion of untempered youth" serves as a powerful juxtaposition that highlights the difference between fleeting desires and enduring connections.

### Historical and Personal Context

Paul Laurence Dunbar, an African American poet who wrote during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, often explored themes of love, longing, and the struggles of the human experience in his work. As a black writer during a time of racial segregation and discrimination, Dunbar's personal experiences likely influenced his exploration of universal themes of sorrow and missed opportunities. The societal context of his time, marked by racial tensions and limitations on personal freedom, may have informed his portrayal of the complexities of human emotions in the face of adversity.

### Deep Reading

At its core, "Life's Tragedy" delves into the profound complexities of human emotions and experiences. The poem suggests that true sorrow lies not in the absence of love or expression, but in the nearness to perfection that remains unattainable. The idea of counting joys not by what one has but by what is out of reach speaks to the human tendency to focus on what is lacking rather than appreciating what is present. Through the contrast between the idealized "perfect love" and the fleeting passions of youth, Dunbar explores the enduring nature of genuine connections that transcend superficial desires. Ultimately, the poem invites readers to reflect on the nature of longing, loss, and the pursuit of that which remains just beyond our grasp.

## Sympathy by Emily Bronte

```
There should be no despair for you
While nightly stars are burning,
While evening pours its silent dew
And sunshine gilds the morning.
There should be no despair - though tears
May flow down like a river:
Are not the best beloved of years
Around your heart forever?

They weep - you weep - it must be so;
Winds sigh as you are sighing,
And Winter sheds his grief in snow
Where Autumn's leaves are lying:
Yet these revive, and from their fate
Your fate cannot be parted,
Then journey on, if not elate,
Still, never broken-hearted!
```
