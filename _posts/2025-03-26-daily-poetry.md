## Disabled by Wilfred Owen

```
He sat in a wheeled chair, waiting for dark,
And shivered in his ghastly suit of grey,
Legless, sewn short at elbow.  Through the park
Voices of boys rang saddening like a hymn,
Voices of play and pleasure after day,
Till gathering sleep had mothered them from him.

About this time Town used to swing so gay
When glow-lamps budded in the light-blue trees
And girls glanced lovelier as the air grew dim,
-- In the old times, before he threw away his knees.
Now he will never feel again how slim
Girls' waists are, or how warm their subtle hands,
All of them touch him like some queer disease.

There was an artist silly for his face,
For it was younger than his youth, last year.
Now he is old; his back will never brace;
He's lost his colour very far from here,
Poured it down shell-holes till the veins ran dry,
And half his lifetime lapsed in the hot race,
And leap of purple spurted from his thigh.
One time he liked a bloodsmear down his leg,
After the matches carried shoulder-high.
It was after football, when he'd drunk a peg,
He thought he'd better join.  He wonders why . . .
Someone had said he'd look a god in kilts.

That's why; and maybe, too, to please his Meg,
Aye, that was it, to please the giddy jilts,
He asked to join.  He didn't have to beg;
Smiling they wrote his lie; aged nineteen years.
Germans he scarcely thought of; and no fears
Of Fear came yet.  He thought of jewelled hilts
For daggers in plaid socks; of smart salutes;
And care of arms; and leave; and pay arrears;
Esprit de corps; and hints for young recruits.
And soon, he was drafted out with drums and cheers.

Some cheered him home, but not as crowds cheer Goal.
Only a solemn man who brought him fruits
Thanked him; and then inquired about his soul.
Now, he will spend a few sick years in Institutes,
And do what things the rules consider wise,
And take whatever pity they may dole.
To-night he noticed how the women's eyes
Passed from him to the strong men that were whole.
How cold and late it is!  Why don't they come
And put him into bed?  Why don't they come?
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "Disabled" by Wilfred Owen is written in free verse, without a consistent meter or rhyme scheme. This lack of formal structure reflects the chaotic and disjointed nature of the soldier's experiences. The poem is divided into seven stanzas, each with varying lengths, contributing to the sense of fragmentation and disconnection.

The enjambment in the poem creates a sense of movement and fluidity, mirroring the soldier's shifting thoughts and emotions. For example, in the third stanza, the lines "Through the park / Voices of boys rang saddening like a hymn" flow seamlessly into each other, conveying a sense of continuous sound and imagery.

The lack of rhyme allows the language to feel more raw and immediate, emphasizing the harsh realities faced by the disabled soldier. Owen's use of descriptive language and vivid imagery conveys the physical and emotional pain experienced by the protagonist, highlighting the devastating consequences of war.

### Themes and Imagery

One of the central themes in the poem is the devastating impact of war on individuals, particularly on young soldiers who are left disabled and disillusioned. The imagery in the poem is stark and powerful, painting a vivid picture of the soldier's physical and emotional suffering. References to the loss of limbs, fading youth, and shattered dreams create a poignant portrayal of the soldier's despair and isolation.

The contrast between the soldier's past and present experiences is highlighted through imagery of light and darkness. The description of the town "swing so gay" with glow-lamps and girls glancing lovelier creates a sense of nostalgia and longing for a time before the soldier's injury. This imagery is juxtaposed with the soldier's current reality of loneliness and alienation.

The poem also explores themes of identity, masculinity, and the societal expectations placed on young men to participate in war. The soldier's decision to join the military out of a desire to impress a girl and conform to societal norms ultimately leads to his physical and emotional destruction.

### Literary Devices

Owen employs various literary devices to convey the themes and emotions of the poem. The use of simile in the line "All of them touch him like some queer disease" compares the soldier's interactions with others to a contagious illness, emphasizing his sense of alienation and otherness.

The repetition of the phrase "Why don't they come" at the end of the poem creates a sense of desperation and abandonment, highlighting the soldier's isolation and longing for companionship. This repetition serves to emphasize the soldier's vulnerability and the lack of support he receives.

Owen also uses symbolism, such as the reference to the soldier's lost color and drained veins, to represent his physical and emotional depletion. The image of the soldier pouring his color down shell-holes conveys the sense of waste and destruction caused by war.

### Historical and Personal Context

Wilfred Owen was a British poet who served as a soldier in World War I, and his poetry often reflects his firsthand experiences of the horrors of war. "Disabled" was written during Owen's time in the trenches, where he witnessed the physical and psychological toll of combat on young men.

The poem captures the disillusionment and trauma faced by soldiers who returned from war with life-altering injuries. Owen's depiction of the disabled soldier's struggles reflects the broader societal impact of war on individuals and communities, shedding light on the often overlooked consequences of armed conflict.

### Deep Reading

"Disabled" explores the devastating consequences of war on both the individual and society as a whole. The poem delves into the themes of loss, isolation, and the dehumanizing effects of conflict. By focusing on the personal struggles of a disabled soldier, Owen challenges the glorification of war and highlights the harsh realities faced by those who are left broken and forgotten.

The poem's poignant imagery and emotional depth serve as a powerful critique of the senseless violence and destruction wrought by war. Through the soldier's experiences of longing, regret, and despair, Owen invites readers to confront the human cost of armed conflict and to question the societal values that perpetuate such suffering.

Overall, "Disabled" is a haunting and poignant reflection on the physical and emotional scars left by war, urging readers to remember the sacrifices made by those who bear the burden of conflict long after the fighting has ceased.

## Sonnet 33 - Yes, call me by my pet-name! let me hear by Elizabeth Barrett Browning

```
Yes, call me by my pet-name! let me hear
The name I used to run at, when a child,
From innocent play, and leave the cowslips piled,
To glance up in some face that proved me dear
With the look of its eyes. I miss the clear
Fond voices which, being drawn and reconciled
Into the music of Heaven's undefiled,
Call me no longer. Silence on the bier,
While I call God—call God!—So let thy mouth
Be heir to those who are now exanimate.
Gather the north flowers to complete the south,
And catch the early love up in the late.
Yes, call me by that name,—and I, in truth,
With the same heart, will answer and not wait.
```

## The Funeral of Youth: Threnody by Rupert Brooke

```
The Day that Youth had died,
There came to his grave-side,
In decent mourning, from the country’s ends,
Those scatter’d friends
Who had lived the boon companions of his prime,
And laughed with him and sung with him and wasted,
In feast and wine and many-crown’d carouse,
The days and nights and dawnings of the time
When Youth kept open house,
Nor left untasted
Aught of his high emprise and ventures dear,
No quest of his unshar’d—
All these, with loitering feet and sad head bar’d,
Followed their old friend’s bier.
Folly went first,
With muffled bells and coxcomb still revers’d;
And after trod the bearers, hat in hand—
Laughter, most hoarse, and Captain Pride with tanned
And martial face all grim, and fussy Joy
Who had to catch a train, and Lust, poor, snivelling boy;
These bore the dear departed.
Behind them, broken-hearted,
Came Grief, so noisy a widow, that all said,
“Had he but wed
Her elder sister Sorrow, in her stead!”
And by her, trying to soothe her all the time,
The fatherless children, Colour, Tune, and Rhyme
(The sweet lad Rhyme), ran all-uncomprehending.
Then, at the way’s sad ending,
Round the raw grave they stay’d. Old Wisdom read,
In mumbling tone, the Service for the Dead.
There stood Romance,
The furrowing tears had mark’d her rougиd cheek;
Poor old Conceit, his wonder unassuaged;
Dead Innocency’s daughter, Ignorance;
And shabby, ill-dress’d Generosity;
And Argument, too full of woe to speak;
Passion, grown portly, something middle-aged;
And Friendship—not a minute older, she;
Impatience, ever taking out his watch;
Faith, who was deaf, and had to lean, to catch
Old Wisdom’s endless drone.
Beauty was there,
Pale in her black; dry-eyed; she stood alone.
Poor maz’d Imagination; Fancy wild;
Ardour, the sunlight on his greying hair;
Contentment, who had known Youth as a child
And never seen him since. And Spring came too,
Dancing over the tombs, and brought him flowers—
She did not stay for long.
And Truth, and Grace, and all the merry crew,
The laughing Winds and Rivers, and lithe Hours;
And Hope, the dewy-eyed; and sorrowing Song;—
Yes, with much woe and mourning general,
At dead Youth’s funeral,
Even these were met once more together, all,
Who erst the fair and living Youth did know;
All, except only Love. Love had died long ago.
```
