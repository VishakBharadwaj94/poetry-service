## To Marie Louise (Shew) by Edgar Allan Poe

```
Not long ago, the writer of these lines,
In the mad pride of intellectuality,
Maintained "the power of words"--denied that ever
A thought arose within the human brain
Beyond the utterance of the human tongue:
And now, as if in mockery of that boast,
Two words--two foreign soft dissyllables--
Italian tones, made only to be murmured
By angels dreaming in the moonlit "dew
That hangs like chains of pearl on Hermon hill,"--
Have stirred from out the abysses of his heart,
Unthought-like thoughts that are the souls of thought,
Richer, far wilder, far diviner visions
Than even the seraph harper, Israfel,
(Who has "the sweetest voice of all God's creatures,")
Could hope to utter. And I! my spells are broken.
The pen falls powerless from my shivering hand.
With thy dear name as text, though hidden by thee,
I cannot write--I cannot speak or think--
Alas, I cannot feel; for 'tis not feeling,
This standing motionless upon the golden
Threshold of the wide-open gate of dreams,
Gazing, entranced, adown the gorgeous vista,
And thrilling as I see, upon the right,
Upon the left, and all the way along,
Amid empurpled vapors, far away
To where the prospect terminates--_thee only_!
```

## From “Later Life” by Christina Rossetti

```
VI
We lack, yet cannot fix upon the lack:
Not this, nor that; yet somewhat, certainly.
We see the things we do not yearn to see
Around us: and what see we glancing back?
Lost hopes that leave our hearts upon the rack,
Hopes that were never ours yet seem’d to be,
For which we steer’d on life’s salt stormy sea
Braving the sunstroke and the frozen pack.
If thus to look behind is all in vain,
And all in vain to look to left or right,
Why face we not our future once again,
Launching with hardier hearts across the main,
Straining dim eyes to catch the invisible sight,
And strong to bear ourselves in patient pain?

IX
Star Sirius and the Pole Star dwell afar
Beyond the drawings each of other’s strength:
One blazes through the brief bright summer’s length
Lavishing life-heat from a flaming car;
While one unchangeable upon a throne
Broods o’er the frozen heart of earth alone,
Content to reign the bright particular star
Of some who wander or of some who groan.
They own no drawings each of other’s strength,
Nor vibrate in a visible sympathy,
Nor veer along their courses each toward
Yet are their orbits pitch’d in harmony
Of one dear heaven, across whose depth and length
Mayhap they talk together without speech.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

Section VI follows a rhyme scheme of ABAB CDCD, while Section IX follows a rhyme scheme of ABAB CCDD. This structured rhyme scheme adds a sense of cohesion to the poem.

### Themes and Imagery

The themes in "Later Life" revolve around introspection, loss, and the passage of time. In Section VI, Rossetti explores the idea of longing for a past that was filled with lost hopes and unfulfilled dreams. The imagery of a "life’s salt stormy sea" and "braving the sunstroke and the frozen pack" paints a vivid picture of life's challenges and uncertainties. In contrast, Section IX delves into the theme of distance and connection. The images of Star Sirius and the Pole Star symbolize the idea of beings existing in harmony despite their physical separation. The imagery of one star "lavishing life-heat" and the other "brooding o’er the frozen heart of earth alone" conveys a sense of both warmth and isolation.

### Literary Devices

Rossetti employs various literary devices to enhance the themes and imagery in "Later Life." In Section VI, the use of paradox is evident in lines like "We lack, yet cannot fix upon the lack" and "Braving the sunstroke and the frozen pack," highlighting the contradictory nature of human experiences. Additionally, the repetition of the word "vain" in "all in vain to look to left or right" emphasizes the futility of looking back. In Section IX, the personification of the stars as having conversations "without speech" adds a mystical quality to the poem. The use of symbolism in the stars represents the idea of distant yet connected souls.

### Historical and Personal Context

Christina Rossetti was a Victorian poet known for her introspective and melancholic themes. "Later Life" reflects the poet's own struggles with loss and longing, which were common themes in her work. Rossetti's religious background and personal experiences likely influenced the spiritual undertones present in the poem. The Victorian era was characterized by societal changes and a fascination with the passage of time, which are reflected in Rossetti's exploration of these themes in "Later Life."

### Deep Reading

A deeper analysis of "Later Life" reveals a contemplation on the complexities of human emotions and relationships. The poet grapples with the idea of looking back on the past with regret and longing, yet also looks forward to the future with a sense of resilience and determination. The contrast between the turbulent sea imagery in Section VI and the celestial harmony of the stars in Section IX highlights the dualities present in life - chaos and order, longing and contentment. Ultimately, Rossetti suggests that despite the uncertainties and hardships of life, there is a sense of interconnectedness and harmony that transcends physical distance. The poem serves as a meditation on the cyclical nature of existence and the eternal search for meaning and connection.

## All but Death, can be Adjusted -- by Emily Dickinson

```
All but Death, can be Adjusted --
Dynasties repaired --
Systems -- settled in their Sockets --

Wastes of Lives -- resown with Colors
By Succeeding Springs --
Death -- unto itself -- Exception --
Is exempt from Change --
