## Little Brown Baby by Paul Laurence Dunbar

```
Little brown baby wif spa'klin' eyes,
Come to yo' pappy an' set on his knee.
What you been doin', suh -- makin' san' pies?
Look at dat bib -- you's es du'ty ez me.
Look at dat mouf -- dat's merlasses, I bet;
Come hyeah, Maria, an' wipe off his han's.
Bees gwine to ketch you an' eat you up yit,
Bein' so sticky an sweet -- goodness lan's!
Little brown baby wif spa'klin' eyes,
Who's pappy's darlin' an' who's pappy's chile?
Who is it all de day nevah once tries
Fu' to be cross, er once loses dat smile?
Whah did you git dem teef? My, you's a scamp!
Whah did dat dimple come f'om in yo' chin?
Pappy do' know you -- I b'lieves you's a tramp;
Mammy, dis hyeah's some ol' straggler got in!

Let's th'ow him outen de do' in de san',
We do' want stragglers a-layin' 'roun' hyeah;
Let's gin him 'way to de big buggah-man;
I know he's hidin' erroun' hyeah right neah.
Buggah-man, buggah-man, come in de do',
Hyeah's a bad boy you kin have fu' to eat.
Mammy an' pappy do' want him no mo',
Swaller him down f'om his haid to his feet!

Dah, now, I t'ought dat you'd hug me up close.
Go back, ol' buggah, you sha'n't have dis boy.
He ain't no tramp, ner no straggler, of co'se;
He's pappy's pa'dner an' play-mate an' joy.
Come to you' pallet now -- go to yo' res';
Wisht you could allus know ease an' cleah skies;
Wisht you could stay jes' a chile on my breas'--
Little brown baby wif spa'klin' eyes!
```

## How far is it to Heaven? by Emily Dickinson

```
How far is it to Heaven?
As far as Death this way --
Of River or of Ridge beyond
Was no discovery.

How far is it to Hell?
As far as Death this way --
How far left hand the Sepulchre
Defies Topography.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

In terms of form, this poem by Emily Dickinson consists of two stanzas, each comprised of four lines. The rhyme scheme in each stanza is ABCB, with the second and fourth lines rhyming. This consistent structure adds a sense of symmetry and balance to the poem. 

There is no strict meter in this poem, as Dickinson often employed free verse in her works. However, there is a rhythmic quality to the lines, with a mix of shorter and longer phrases creating a natural flow when read aloud.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of this poem revolves around the concept of the afterlife and the unknown distances to Heaven and Hell. The speaker ponders the distance to these realms, using Death as a metaphorical marker. The imagery of rivers, ridges, and sepulchres adds a sense of mystery and otherworldliness to the exploration of these existential questions.

The imagery of a river or ridge representing the distance to Heaven suggests a natural barrier or boundary that cannot be easily crossed. In contrast, the idea of Hell being as far as Death implies a sense of inevitability and finality. The use of these vivid images creates a haunting and contemplative atmosphere in the poem.

### Literary Devices

One of the key literary devices used in this poem is metaphor. Death is metaphorically equated with the distance to Heaven and Hell, highlighting the uncertainty and unknowability of the afterlife. The speaker also personifies Death by suggesting it has a hand that defies topography, adding a sense of agency and power to this abstract concept.

Additionally, Dickinson employs paradox in the lines "How far left hand the Sepulchre / Defies Topography." The idea of a left hand defying topography is a striking image that emphasizes the mysterious and enigmatic nature of Death and its relationship to the afterlife.

### Historical and Personal Context

Emily Dickinson's poems often explore themes of death, immortality, and the afterlife, reflecting her own personal struggles and beliefs. As a reclusive poet who grappled with questions of mortality and spirituality, Dickinson's work is deeply introspective and contemplative. This poem can be seen as a reflection of her own musings on the nature of existence and what lies beyond this life.

In a historical context, the mid-19th century in which Dickinson lived was a time of great social and religious upheaval in America. The concept of Heaven and Hell, as well as the idea of death as a gateway to the afterlife, were central to the prevailing religious beliefs of the time. Dickinson's exploration of these themes in her poetry reflects the broader cultural and philosophical debates of her era.

### Deep Reading

On a deeper level, "How far is it to Heaven?" can be interpreted as a meditation on the unknowable nature of the afterlife and the limitations of human understanding. By using Death as a point of reference for measuring the distance to Heaven and Hell, the poem suggests that these realms are beyond the grasp of mortal comprehension. The speaker's contemplation of these mysteries evokes a sense of awe and humility in the face of the unknown.

The imagery of rivers, ridges, and sepulchres serves to underscore the idea that the boundaries between life and death, this world and the next, are not easily defined or traversed. The poem challenges conventional notions of spatial distance and invites readers to consider the metaphysical dimensions of existence. In this way, Dickinson's poem encourages a deeper reflection on the mysteries of life, death, and what lies beyond.

## V. The Soldier by Rupert Brooke

```
If I should die, think only this of me:
That there's some corner of a foreign field
That is for ever England. There shall be
In that rich earth a richer dust concealed;
A dust whom England bore, shaped, made aware,
Gave, once, her flowers to love, her ways to roam,
A body of England's, breathing English air,
Washed by the rivers, blest by suns of home.

And think, this heart, all evil shed away,
A pulse in the eternal mind, no less
Gives somewhere back the thoughts by England given;
Her sights and sounds; dreams happy as her day;
And laughter, learnt of friends; and gentleness,
In hearts at peace, under an English heaven.
```

The imagery of nature and landscape serves to highlight the soldier's deep-rooted connection to England.

### Literary Devices

Brooke employs various literary devices to enhance the poem's meaning and evoke emotion. One of the most prominent devices is personification, as England is personified as a nurturing mother who shapes and gives life to her children.
