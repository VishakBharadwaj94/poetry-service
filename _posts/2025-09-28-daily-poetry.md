## Good-Night by Percy Bysshe Shelley

```
Good-night? ah! no; the hour is ill
Which severs those it should unite;
Let us remain together still,
Then it will be GOOD night.

How can I call the lone night good,
Though thy sweet wishes wing its flight?
Be it not said, thought, understood--
Then it will be--GOOD night.

To hearts which near each other move
From evening close to morning light,
The night is good; because, my love,
They never SAY good-night.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

In terms of form, "Good-Night" by Percy Bysshe Shelley is a three-stanza poem with a consistent rhyme scheme of ABAB. The meter is primarily iambic tetrameter, with lines alternating between four and three feet. This gives the poem a rhythmic flow and a sense of balance. The structure is simple yet effective, with each stanza building upon the previous one to convey the central message of the poem.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem revolves around the idea of separation and the longing to remain together. The speaker expresses reluctance to say goodnight, as it symbolizes a temporary farewell that disrupts the unity between two hearts. The imagery of night is used to represent this separation, with darkness symbolizing loneliness and distance. The poem conveys a sense of emotional intimacy and the desire for continuity in relationships.

### Literary Devices

Shelley employs several literary devices in "Good-Night" to enhance its meaning. One notable device is the use of repetition, particularly the phrase "Good night." This repetition emphasizes the speaker's internal conflict and highlights the importance of staying together. Additionally, the poem features alliteration in lines such as "sweet wishes wing" and "my love," adding a musical quality to the verses. The use of personification, such as giving night the ability to understand, adds depth to the poem.

### Historical and Personal Context

Shelley's personal life, marked by tumultuous relationships and tragic losses, likely influenced the themes of love and separation in the poem. The poet's own experiences of longing and emotional intensity are reflected in the speaker's plea to remain together despite the night's arrival. Additionally, the Romantic era's focus on individual emotion and nature is evident in the poem's exploration of love and connection.

### Deep Reading

On a deeper level, "Good-Night" can be seen as a reflection on the transient nature of human relationships and the fear of losing connection with a loved one. The speaker's reluctance to say goodnight stems from a desire for permanence and continuity in a world that is constantly changing. By framing the concept of goodnight as a symbolic gesture of parting, Shelley invites readers to consider the significance of small moments in relationships and the impact of separation on emotional bonds. Ultimately, the poem highlights the importance of cherishing time spent together and the power of love to transcend distance and time.

## Stars by Joyce Kilmer

```
(For the Rev. James J. Daly, S. J.)

Bright stars, yellow stars, flashing through the air,
Are you errant strands of Lady Mary's hair?
As she slits the cloudy veil and bends down through,
Do you fall across her cheeks and over heaven too?
Gay stars, little stars, you are little eyes,
Eyes of baby angels playing in the skies.
Now and then a winged child turns his merry face
Down toward the spinning world -- what a funny place!
Jesus Christ came from the Cross (Christ receive my soul!)
In each perfect hand and foot there was a bloody hole.
Four great iron spikes there were, red and never dry,
Michael plucked them from the Cross and set them in the sky.
Christ's Troop, Mary's Guard, God's own men,
Draw your swords and strike at Hell and strike again.
Every steel-born spark that flies where God's battles are,
Flashes past the face of God, and is a star.
```

## At Home by Christina Rossetti

```
When I was dead, my spirit turned
To seek the much-frequented house:
I passed the door, and saw my friends
Feasting beneath green orange boughs;
From hand to hand they pushed the wine,
They sucked the pulp of plum and peach;
They sang, they jested, and they laughed,
For each was loved of each.

I listened to thier honest chat:
Said one: "To-morrow we shall be
Plod plod along the featureless sands,
And coasting miles and miles of sea."
Said one: "Before the turn of tide
We will achieve the eyrie-seat."
Said one: "To-morrow shall be like
To-day, but much more sweet."

"To-morrow," said they, strong with hope,
And dwelt upon the pleasant way:
"To-morrow," cried they, one and all,
While no one spoke of yesterday.
Their life stood full at blessed noon;
I, only I, had passed away:
"To-morrow and to-day," they cried;
I was of yesterday.

I shivered comfortless, but cast
No chill across the table-cloth;
I, all-forgotten, shivered, sad
To stay, and yet to part how loth:
I passed from the familiar room,
I who from love had passed away,
Like the remembrance of a guest
That tarrieth but a day.
```
