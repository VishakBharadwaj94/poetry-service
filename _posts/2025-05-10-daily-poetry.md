## Hymn of Apollo by Percy Bysshe Shelley

```
The sleepless Hours who watch me as I lie,
Curtained with star-inwoven tapestries
From the broad moonlight of the sky,
Fanning the busy dreams from my dim eyes,--
Waken me when their Mother, the gray Dawn,
Tells them that dreams and that the moon is gone.

Then I arise, and climbing Heaven's blue dome,
I walk over the mountains and the waves,
Leaving my robe upon the ocean foam;
My footsteps pave the clouds with fire; the caves
Are filled with my bright presence, and the air
Leaves the green Earth to my embraces bare.

The sunbeams are my shafts, with which I kill
Deceit, that loves the night and fears the day;
All men who do or even imagine ill
Fly me, and from the glory of my ray
Good minds and open actions take new might,
Until diminished by the reign of Night.

I feed the clouds, the rainbows and the flowers
With their aethereal colours; the moon's globe
And the pure stars in their eternal bowers
Are cinctured with my power as with a robe;
Whatever lamps on Earth or Heaven may shine
Are portions of one power, which is mine.

I stand at noon upon the peak of Heaven,
Then with unwilling steps I wander down
Into the clouds of the Atlantic even;
For grief that I depart they weep and frown:
What look is more delightful than the smile
With which I soothe them from the western isle?

I am the eye with which the Universe
Beholds itself and knows itself divine;
All harmony of instrument or verse,
All prophecy, all medicine is mine,
All light of art or nature;--to my song
Victory and praise in its own right belong.
```

The imagery of star-inwoven tapestries, moonlight, mountains, waves, and clouds conveys Apollo's dominion over nature and his ability to bring beauty and order to the universe. The sunbeams symbolize Apollo's role in dispelling darkness and deceit, while the references to rainbows, flowers, and celestial bodies emphasize his creative and nurturing presence.

### Literary Devices

Shelley employs various literary devices to enhance the poem's impact. Personification is used to depict the Hours as watchful beings who awaken Apollo at dawn, adding a mystical quality to the narrative. Symbolism is evident in the sunbeams representing truth and enlightenment, as well as in Apollo's role as the eye through which the Universe sees itself. Alliteration, assonance, and imagery are utilized to create a sense of awe and wonder, as seen in phrases like "Fanning the busy dreams" and "My footsteps pave the clouds with fire." These devices contribute to the poem's ethereal and transcendent tone.

### Historical and Personal Context

Written during the Romantic era, a period marked by a fascination with nature, imagination, and the supernatural, Shelley's poem reflects these thematic concerns. The Romantic poets often drew inspiration from classical mythology, as seen in Shelley's portrayal of Apollo as a majestic and benevolent deity.

## Sonnet Reversed by Rupert Brooke

```
Hand trembling towards hand; the amazing lights
Of heart and eye. They stood on supreme heights.

Ah, the delirious weeks of honeymoon!
Soon they returned, and, after strange adventures,
Settled at Balham by the end of June.
Their money was in Can. Pacs. B. Debentures,
And in Antofagastas. Still he went
Cityward daily; still she did abide
At home. And both were really quite content
With work and social pleasures. Then they died.
They left three children (besides George, who drank):
The eldest Jane, who married Mr Bell,
William, the head-clerk in the County Bank,
And Henry, a stock-broker, doing well.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme
The poem "Sonnet Reversed" by Rupert Brooke is a sonnet that deviates from the traditional form and structure of a sonnet. While traditional sonnets often consist of 14 lines with a specific rhyme scheme and meter, this poem consists of 16 lines. The poem is divided into four quatrains, each with alternating rhyme scheme (ABAB) except for the last quatrain which follows a AABB rhyme scheme. The irregular structure of the sonnet mirrors the unconventional nature of the content.

In terms of meter, the poem does not adhere strictly to a specific meter such as iambic pentameter. Instead, the lines vary in length and rhythm, adding to the conversational tone of the poem. This deviation from traditional sonnet form reflects the theme of the poem, which explores the mundane reality of a marriage after the initial excitement of the honeymoon phase.

### Themes and Imagery
The poem delves into the theme of disillusionment and the passage of time in a marriage. The imagery of "Hand trembling towards hand" and "the amazing lights/ Of heart and eye" in the opening lines conveys the initial excitement and intimacy of a newlywed couple. However, as the poem progresses, the imagery shifts to depict a more mundane existence, with the couple settling into routine and eventually passing away.

The theme of financial stability and societal expectations is also present in the poem, as seen in the mention of the couple's investments and the successful careers of their children. The contrast between the initial passion of the couple and the eventual ordinariness of their lives highlights the passage of time and the inevitability of change.

### Literary Devices
Brooke employs various literary devices in the poem to convey the themes and emotions of the narrative. The use of enjambment, where a sentence or phrase continues from one line to the next without punctuation, creates a sense of continuity and flow in the poem. For example, in the lines "Their money was in Can. Pacs. B. Debentures,/ And in Antofagastas. Still he went," the enjambment connects the couple's financial investments to the husband's daily routine.

The poem also utilizes irony, particularly in the final lines where the children of the couple are described. The mention of George, who "drank," juxtaposed with the successful careers of the other children, adds a layer of complexity to the portrayal of family dynamics and societal expectations.

### Historical and Personal Context
Rupert Brooke, the author of the poem, was known for his romantic and patriotic poetry. However, "Sonnet Reversed" departs from his usual themes of idealism and heroism to explore the realities of everyday life and relationships. The poem was likely influenced by Brooke's own experiences and observations of marriage and societal expectations.

Written in the early 20th century, the poem reflects the changing social norms and values of the time, particularly regarding marriage and family dynamics. The mention of the couple's investments and the successful careers of their children allude to the growing importance of financial stability and social status in society.

### Deep Reading
On a deeper level, "Sonnet Reversed" can be seen as a meditation on the fleeting nature of passion and the inevitability of time passing. The reversal of the typical sonnet structure and the unconventional portrayal of marriage challenge traditional romantic ideals and highlight the complexities of long-term relationships.

The poem's exploration of disillusionment and resignation in marriage serves as a critique of societal expectations and the pressure to conform to traditional roles. By juxtaposing the initial excitement of the honeymoon phase with the eventual ordinariness of daily life, Brooke captures the bittersweet reality of love and marriage.

Overall, "Sonnet Reversed" offers a nuanced and thought-provoking reflection on the complexities of human relationships and the passage of time, inviting readers to consider the evolving nature of love and commitment.

## Lines Written In Early Spring by William Wordsworth

```
I heard a thousand blended notes,
While in a grove I sate reclined,
In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts
Bring sad thoughts to the mind.

To her fair works did Nature link
The human soul that through me ran;
And much it grieved my heart to think
What man has made of man.

Through primrose tufts, in that green bower,
The periwinkle trailed its wreaths;
And 'tis my faith that every flower
Enjoys the air it breathes.

The birds around me hopped and played,
Their thoughts I cannot measure:--
But the least motion which they made
It seemed a thrill of pleasure.

The budding twigs spread out their fan,
To catch the breezy air;
And I must think, do all I can,
That there was pleasure there.

If this belief from heaven be sent,
If such be Nature's holy plan,
Have I not reason to lament
What man has made of man?
```
