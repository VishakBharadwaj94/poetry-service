## Why I am a Liberal by Robert Browning

```
"Why?" Because all I haply can and do,
  All that I am now, all I hope to be,--
  Whence comes it save from fortune setting free
Body and soul the purpose to pursue,
God traced for both? If fetters, not a few,
  Of prejudice, convention, fall from me,
  These shall I bid men--each in his degree
Also God-guided--bear, and gayly too?
  But little do or can the best of us:
That little is achieved thro' Liberty.
  Who then dares hold, emancipated thus,
His fellow shall continue bound? not I,
  Who live, love, labour freely, nor discuss
A brother's right to freedom. That is "Why."
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "Why I am a Liberal" by Robert Browning consists of a single stanza of fourteen lines, following a traditional sonnet form. It is written in iambic pentameter, with a rhyme scheme of ABBAABBACDCDCD. This structure is typical of a Petrarchan or Italian sonnet, with an octave (first eight lines) presenting a problem or question and a sestet (last six lines) providing a resolution or answer.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem is the speaker's justification for being a liberal. Browning explores the idea of freedom, both personal and societal, as well as the concept of individual agency in pursuing one's purpose. The imagery of "fetters" of prejudice and convention falling away suggests a liberation from societal constraints, allowing for personal growth and the pursuit of one's goals. The mention of being "God-guided" implies a sense of divine purpose and the belief in the inherent goodness of humanity.

### Literary Devices

Browning employs several literary devices in the poem. One notable device is anaphora, seen in the repetition of "Why?" at the beginning of the poem, emphasizing the speaker's reason for being a liberal. The use of alliteration in phrases like "fetters, not a few" and "live, love, labour freely" adds a rhythmic quality to the poem. Additionally, the metaphor of being "emancipated" symbolizes breaking free from societal constraints and embracing personal freedom.

### Historical and Personal Context

Written in the 19th century, Browning's poem reflects the political and social climate of the time. The term "liberal" in this context likely refers to a belief in individual rights, freedom of expression, and progressive values. Browning himself was known for his progressive views, and this poem can be seen as a reflection of his own political beliefs.

### Deep Reading

Through a deeper analysis of the poem, we can see that Browning is advocating for individual freedom and autonomy. The speaker's assertion that their own liberty is achieved through freedom implies a belief in the interconnectedness of individual rights. By questioning the idea of one person's freedom being dependent on another's oppression, Browning challenges the traditional power structures of his time. The final line, "A brother's right to freedom. That is 'Why'", reinforces the idea that true liberalism is rooted in a respect for the rights and freedoms of all individuals. Overall, the poem serves as a powerful statement on the importance of personal agency, societal progress, and the pursuit of individual purpose.

## For largest Woman's Hearth I knew by Emily Dickinson

```
For largest Woman's Hearth I knew --
'Tis little I can do --
And yet the largest Woman's Heart
Could hold an Arrow -- too --
And so, instructed by my own,
I tenderer, turn Me to.
```

## It Rains by Edward Thomas

```
IT rains, and nothing stirs within the fence
Anywhere through the orchard's untrodden, dense
Forest of parsley. The great diamonds
Of rain on the grassblades there is none to break,
Or the fallen petals further down to shake.

And I am nearly as happy as possible
To search the wilderness in vain though well,
To think of two walking, kissing there,
Drenched, yet forgetting the kisses of the rain:
Sad, too, to think that never, never again,

Unless alone, so happy shall I walk
In the rain. When I turn away, on its fine stalk
Twilight has fined to naught, the parsley flower
Figures, suspended still and ghostly white,
The past hovering as it revisits the light.
```
