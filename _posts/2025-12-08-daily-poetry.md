## How still, how happy! by Emily Bronte

```
How still, how happy! Those are words
That once would scarce agree together;
I loved the plashing of the surge -
The changing heaven the breezy weather,

More than smooth seas and cloudless skies
And solemn, soothing, softened airs
That in the forest woke no sighs
And from the green spray shook no tears.

How still, how happy! now I feel
Where silence dwells is sweeter far
Than laughing mirth's most joyous swell
However pure its raptures are.

Come, sit down on this sunny stone:
'Tis wintry light o'er flowerless moors -
But sit - for we are all alone
And clear expand heaven's breathless shores.

I could think in the withered grass
Spring's budding wreaths we might discern;
The violet's eye might shyly flash
And young leaves shoot among the fern.

It is but thought - full many a night
The snow shall clothe those hills afar
And storms shall add a drearier blight
And winds shall wage a wilder war,

Before the lark may herald in
Fresh foliage twined with blossoms fair
And summer days again begin
Their glory - haloed crown to wear.

Yet my heart loves December's smile
As much as July's golden beam;
Then let us sit and watch the while
The blue ice curdling on the stream -
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "How still, how happy!" by Emily Bronte is written in four stanzas with varying line lengths, creating a sense of movement and progression within the poem. The rhyme scheme is irregular, with a mix of rhymed and unrhymed lines, contributing to the poem's contemplative and reflective tone. The meter is also irregular, with a mix of iambic and trochaic rhythms, adding to the natural flow and organic feel of the poem.

### Themes and Imagery

The main themes of the poem revolve around the contrasts between stillness and happiness, nature, and the passage of time. The speaker reflects on their past love for the dynamic elements of nature like surging waves and changing skies, finding beauty in their impermanence. The imagery in the poem is vivid and evocative, with descriptions of the sea, forest, grass, flowers, and changing seasons painting a rich picture of the natural world.

### Literary Devices

Bronte employs several literary devices to enhance the poem's themes and imagery. There is personification in lines like "the changing heaven" and "laughing mirth," giving human-like qualities to nature and emotions. The use of simile in "December's smile / As much as July's golden beam" highlights the speaker's appreciation for different seasons. The contrast between stillness and movement serves as a powerful metaphor for the speaker's internal conflicts and shifting perspectives.

### Historical and Personal Context

Emily Bronte, a renowned 19th-century English novelist and poet, is known for her introspective and nature-inspired works. This poem reflects her deep connection to the natural world and her exploration of complex emotions. The contrast between the speaker's past and present feelings towards nature may reflect Bronte's own struggles with change and the passage of time, as well as her appreciation for the beauty found in impermanence.

### Deep Reading

At its core, "How still, how happy!" delves into the idea of finding contentment and beauty in the midst of change and impermanence. The speaker's shifting preferences from dynamic nature to stillness and silence suggest a deeper internal transformation and acceptance of life's transience. The poem invites readers to reflect on their own relationship with nature, time, and the ever-changing seasons of life, urging them to find peace and joy in the present moment, even amidst the inevitable storms and winters that lie ahead.

## Robbed by Death -- but that was easy -- by Emily Dickinson

```
Robbed by Death -- but that was easy --
To the failing Eye
I could hold the latest Glowing --
Robbed by Liberty

For Her Jugular Defences --
This, too, I endured --
Hint of Glory -- it afforded --
For the Brave Beloved --

Fraud of Distance -- Fraud of Danger,
Fraud of Death -- to bear --
It is Bounty -- to Suspense's
Vague Calamity --

Stalking our entire Possession
On a Hair's result --
Then -- seesawing -- coolly -- on it --
Trying if it split --
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme
In terms of form, this poem consists of 12 lines divided into three quatrains. The poem does not follow a strict rhyme scheme, with only a few instances of rhyme such as "easy" and "Liberty" in the first stanza. This lack of consistent rhyme scheme contributes to the fragmented and disjointed feeling of the poem. Additionally, the irregular line lengths and enjambment create a sense of unease and instability, mirroring the theme of facing death and uncertainty.

There is no strict meter in this poem, allowing for a more free-flowing and natural rhythm. The lack of a specific meter reflects the speaker's tumultuous emotions and the chaotic nature of dealing with loss and mortality.

### Themes and Imagery
The central theme of the poem revolves around the inevitability of death and the speaker's grappling with loss and mortality. The imagery of being "Robbed by Death" and "Robbed by Liberty" conveys a sense of helplessness and vulnerability in the face of forces beyond control. The image of holding onto the "latest Glowing" suggests a fleeting grasp on life and vitality.

The poem also explores themes of courage and resilience in the face of danger and uncertainty. The mention of "Fraud of Distance" and "Fraud of Danger" implies that these threats may not be as insurmountable as they seem, highlighting the speaker's willingness to endure and persevere.

### Literary Devices
One prominent literary device in this poem is personification, as death is portrayed as a thief ("Robbed by Death") and liberty as a force that can be taken away. This personification adds depth to the theme of mortality and loss, giving abstract concepts tangible qualities.

The poem also utilizes imagery to evoke emotion and create a vivid picture for the reader. The image of "Stalking our entire Possession
On a Hair's result" conveys the precariousness of life and the delicate balance between existence and non-existence.

### Historical and Personal Context
Emily Dickinson's work often delves into themes of death, immortality, and the human experience. As a poet who grappled with loss and isolation, Dickinson's personal experiences likely influenced the themes of this poem. Living in the 19th century, Dickinson would have been surrounded by the realities of death and the fragility of life, which is reflected in her poetry.

### Deep Reading
In a deeper analysis, the poem can be seen as a meditation on the complexities of life and death. The speaker's willingness to endure the "Fraud of Death" and bear the uncertainties of existence reflects a sense of resilience and acceptance in the face of mortality. The idea of "Hint of Glory" being afforded for the "Brave Beloved" suggests that there is a sense of honor and nobility in facing death with courage.

Overall, "Robbed by Death -- but that was easy --" offers a poignant reflection on the transient nature of life, the inevitability of death, and the strength found in confronting mortality with courage and grace.

## Andrea Del Sarto (Called "the Faultless Painter") by Robert Browning

```
But do not let us quarrel any more,
No, my Lucrezia! bear with me for once:
Sit down and all shall happen as you wish.
You turn your face, but does it bring your heart?
I'll work then for your friend's friend, never fear.
Treat his own subject after his own way,
Fix his own time, accept too his own price,
And shut the money into this small hand
When next it takes mine. Will it? tenderly?
Oh, I'll content him,--but to-morrow, Love!
I often am much wearier than you think,
This evening more than usual: and it seems
As if--forgive now--should you let me sit
Here by the window, with your hand in mine,
And look a half-hour forth on Fiesole,
Both of one mind, as married people use,
Quietly, quietly the evening through,
I might get up to-morrow to my work
Cheerful and fresh as ever. Let us try.
To-morrow, how you shall be glad for this!
Your soft hand is a woman of itself,
And mine the man's bared breast she curls inside.
Don't count the time lost, neither; you must serve
For each of the five pictures we require:
It saves a model. So! keep looking so--
My serpentining beauty, rounds on rounds!
--How could you ever prick those perfect ears,
Even to put the pearl there! oh, so sweet--
My face, my moon, my everybody's moon.
Which everybody looks on and calls his,
And, I suppose, is looked on by in turn,
While she looks--no one's: very dear, no less.
You smile? why, there's my picture ready made,
There's what we painters call our harmony!
A common grayness silvers everything,--
All in a twilight, you and I alike
--You, at the point of your first pride in me
(That's gone, you know)--but I, at every point;
My youth, my hope, my art, being all toned down
To yonder sober pleasant Fiesole.
There's the bell clinking from the chapel-top;
That length of convent-wall across the way
Holds the trees safer, huddled more inside;
The last monk leaves the garden; days decrease,
And autumn grows, autumn in everything.
Eh? the whole seems to fall into a shape,
As if I saw alike my work and self
And all that I was born to be and do,
A twilight-piece. Love, we are in God's hand.
How strange now, looks the life he makes us lead;
So free we seem, so fettered fast we are!
I feel he laid the fetter: let it lie!
This chamber for example--turn your head--
All that's behind us! You don't understand
Nor care to understand about my art,
But you can hear at least when people speak:
And that cartoon, the second from the door
--It is the thing, Love! so such things should be--
Behold Madonna!--I am bold to say.
I can do with my pencil what I know,
What I see, what at bottom of my heart
I wish for, if I ever wish so deep--
Do easily, too--when I say, perfectly,
I do not boast, perhaps: yourself are judge,
Who listened to the Legate's talk last week;
And just as much they used to say in France.
At any rate 'tis easy, all of it!
No sketches first, no studies, that's long past:
I do what many dream of, all their lives,
--Dream? strive to do, and agonize to do,
And fail in doing. I could count twenty such
On twice your fingers, and not leave this town,
Who strive--you don't know how the others strive
To paint a little thing like that you smeared
Carelessly passing with your robes afloat,--
Yet do much less, so much less. Someone says,
(I know his name, no matter)--so much less!
Well, less is more, Lucrezia: I am judged.
There burns a truer light of God in them,
In their vexed beating stuffed and stopped-up brain,
Heart, or whate'er else, than goes on to prompt
This low-pulsed forthright craftsman's hand of mine.
Their works drop groundward, but themselves, I know,
Reach many a time a heaven that's shut to me,
Enter and take their place there sure enough,
Tho' they come back and cannot tell the world.
My works are nearer heaven, but I sit here.
The sudden blood of these men! at a word--
Praise them, it boils, or blame them, it boils too.
I, painting from myself and to myself,
Know what I do, am unmoved by men's blame
Or their praise either. Somebody remarks
Morello's outline there is wrongly traced,
His hue mistaken; what of that? or else,
Rightly traced and well ordered; what of that?
Speak as they please, what does the mountain care?
Ah, but a man's reach should exceed his grasp,
Or what's a heaven for? All is silver-gray,
Placid and perfect with my art: the worse!
I know both what I want and what might gain,
And yet how profitless to know, to sigh
"Had I been two, another and myself,
Our head would have o'erlooked the world!" No doubt.

Yonder's a work now, of that famous youth
The Urbinate who died five years ago.
('Tis copied, George Vasari sent it me.)
Well, I can fancy how he did it all,
Pouring his soul, with kings and popes to see,
Reaching, that heaven might so replenish him,
Above and thro' his art--for it gives way;
That arm is wrongly put--and there again--
A fault to pardon in the drawing's lines,
Its body, so to speak: its soul is right,
He means right--that, a child may understand.
Still, what an arm! and I could alter it:
But all the play, the insight and the stretch--
Out of me, out of me! And wherefore out?
Had you enjoined them on me, given me soul,
We might have risen to Rafael, I and you!
Nay, Love, you did give all I asked, I think--
More than I merit, yes, by many times.
But had you--oh, with the same perfect brow,
And perfect eyes, and more than perfect mouth,
And the low voice my soul hears, as a bird
The fowler's pipe, and follows to the snare--
Had you, with these the same, but brought a mind!
Some women do so. Had the mouth there urged
"God and the glory! never care for gain.

The present by the future, what is that?
Live for fame, side by side with Agnolo!
Rafael is waiting: up to God, all three!"
I might have done it for you. So it seems:
Perhaps not. All is as God over-rules.
Beside, incentives come from the soul's self;
The rest avail not. Why do I need you?
What wife had Rafael, or has Agnolo?
In this world, who can do a thing, will not;
And who would do it, cannot, I perceive:
Yet the will's somewhat--somewhat, too, the power--
And thus we half-men struggle. At the end,
God, I conclude, compensates, punishes.
'Tis safer for me, if the award be strict,
That I am something underrated here,
Poor this long while, despised, to speak the truth.
I dared not, do you know, leave home all day,
For fear of chancing on the Paris lords.
The best is when they pass and look aside;
But they speak sometimes; I must bear it all.
Well may they speak. That Francis, that first time,
And that long festal year at Fontainebleau!
I surely then could sometimes leave the ground,
Put on the glory, Rafael's daily wear,
In that humane great monarch's golden look,--
One finger in his beard or twisted curl
Over his mouth's good mark that made the smile.
One arm, about my shoulder, round my neck,
The jingle of his gold chain in my ear,
I painting proudly with his breath on me,
All his court round him, seeing with his eyes.
Such frank French eyes, and such a fire of souls
Profuse, my hand kept plying by those hearts,--
And, best of all, this, this, this face beyond,
This in the background, waiting on my work,
To crown the issue with a last reward!
A good tune, was it not, my kingly days?
And had you not grown restless ... but I know--
'Tis done and past; 'twas right, my instinct said;
Too live the life grew, golden and not gray:
And I'm the weak-eyed bat no sun should tempt
Out of the grange whose four walls make his world,
How could it end in any other way?
You called me, and I came home to your heart,
The triumph was--to reach and stay there; since
I reached it ere the triumph, what is lost?
Let my hands frame your face in your hair's gold,
You beautiful Lucrezia that are mine!
"Rafael did this, Andrea painted that;
The Roman's is the better when you pray,
But still the other's Virgin was his wife--"
Men will excuse me. I am glad to judge
Both pictures in your presence; clearer grows
My better fortune, I resolve to think.
For, do you know, Lucrezia, as God lives,
Said one day Agnolo, his very self,
To Rafael... I have known it all these years...
(When the young man was flaming out his thoughts
Upon a palace-wall for Rome to see,
Too lifted up in heart because of it)
"Friend, there's a certain sorry little scrub
Goes up and down our Florence, none cares how,
Who, were he set to plan and execute
As you are, pricked on by your popes and kings,
Would bring the sweat into that brow of yours!"
To Rafael's!--And indeed the arm is wrong.
I hardly dare ... yet, only you to see,
Give the chalk here--quick, thus the line should go!
Ay, but the soul! he's Rafael! rub it out!
Still, all I care for, if he spoke the truth,
(What he? why, who but Michel Agnolo?
Do you forget already words like those?)
If really there was such a chance so lost,--
Is, whether you're--not grateful--but more pleased.
Well, let me think so. And you smile indeed!

This hour has been an hour! Another smile?
If you would sit thus by me every night
I should work better, do you comprehend?
I mean that I should earn more, give you more.
See, it is settled dusk now; there's a star;
Morello's gone, the watch-lights show the wall,
The cue-owls speak the name we call them by.
Come from the window, Love,--come in, at last,
Inside the melancholy little house
We built to be so gay with. God is just.
King Francis may forgive me: oft at nights
When I look up from painting, eyes tired out,
The walls become illumined, brick from brick
Distinct, instead of mortar, fierce, bright gold,
That gold of his I did cement them with!
Let us but love each other. Must you go?
That Cousin here again? he waits outside?
Must see you--you, and not with me? Those loans?
More gaming debts to pay? you smiled for that?
Well, let smiles buy me! have you more to spend?
While hand and eye and something of a heart
Are left me, work's my ware, and what's it worth?
I'll pay my fancy. Only let me sit
The gray remainder of the evening out,
Idle, you call it, and muse perfectly
How I could paint, were I but back in France,
One picture, just one more--the Virgin's face,
Not yours this time! I want you at my side
To hear them--that is, Michel Agnolo--
Judge all I do and tell you of its worth.
Will you? To-morrow, satisfy your friend.
I take the subjects for his corridor,
Finish the portrait out of hand--there, there,
And throw him in another thing or two
If he demurs; the whole should prove enough
To pay for this same Cousin's freak. Beside,
What's better and what's all I care about,
Get you the thirteen scudi for the ruff!
Love, does that please you? Ah, but what does he,
The Cousin! what does he to please you more?

I am grown peaceful as old age to-night.
I regret little, I would change still less.
Since there my past life lies, why alter it?
The very wrong to Francis!--it is true
I took his coin, was tempted and complied,
And built this house and sinned, and all is said
My father and my mother died of want.
Well, had I riches of my own? you see
How one gets rich! Let each one bear his lot.
They were born poor, lived poor, and poor they died:
And I have laboured somewhat in my time
And not been paid profusely. Some good son
Paint my two hundred pictures--let him try!
No doubt, there's something strikes a balance. Yes,
You love me quite enough, it seems to-night.
This must suffice me here. What would one have?
In heaven, perhaps, new chances, one more chance--
Four great walls in the New Jerusalem,
Meted on each side by the angel's reed,
For Leonard, Rafael, Agnolo, and me
To cover--the three first without a wife,
While I have mine! So--still they overcome
Because there's still Lucrezia,--as I choose.

  Again the Cousin's whistle! Go, my Love.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "Andrea Del Sarto" by Robert Browning is written in blank verse, which is unrhymed iambic pentameter. The lack of rhyme scheme allows the focus to be on the content and the flow of the narrative. The poem is structured as a dramatic monologue, with the speaker, Andrea Del Sarto, addressing his wife Lucrezia. The use of iambic pentameter gives the poem a natural and conversational tone, allowing the reader to immerse themselves in the speaker's thoughts and emotions.

Andrea Del Sarto is portrayed as a talented but flawed artist who struggles with his desire for artistic perfection and his personal life. The imagery in the poem is rich and vivid, with references to painting, art, and the city of Florence. Browning uses imagery such as the painting of the Virgin, the walls of the house illuminated with gold, and the twilight in Fiesole to convey the speaker's inner turmoil and longing for artistic fulfillment.

### Literary Devices

Browning employs various literary devices in the poem to enhance its meaning and evoke emotion. The use of dramatic monologue allows the reader to delve into the inner thoughts and conflicts of Andrea Del Sarto. There is also a use of symbolism, such as the reference to the Virgin's face representing artistic perfection and the gold symbolizing wealth and temptation. The repetition of phrases like "Love" and "I know" creates a sense of intimacy and introspection in the speaker's musings. Additionally, Browning utilizes enjambment to create a natural flow of thoughts and emotions throughout the poem.

### Historical and Personal Context

Robert Browning's poem "Andrea Del Sarto" is based on the life of the real-life Italian Renaissance painter Andrea del Sarto, known for his technical skill and attention to detail. Browning takes artistic liberties in portraying Del Sarto's inner conflicts and struggles, drawing on historical elements such as his relationship with his wife Lucrezia and his interactions with other artists of his time. The poem reflects Browning's interest in exploring the complexities of human nature and the pursuit of artistic excellence.

### Deep Reading

The poem delves deep into the psyche of Andrea Del Sarto, portraying him as a conflicted artist torn between his artistic ambitions and his personal relationships. Del Sarto's longing for artistic perfection is juxtaposed with his realization of his own limitations and failures. The repeated references to Raphael and Michelangelo serve as a reminder of Del Sarto's unfulfilled potential and his desire to achieve greatness. The poem ultimately explores the idea of compromise and acceptance, as Del Sarto comes to terms with his own shortcomings and finds solace in the love of his wife. The final lines of the poem, with the Cousin's whistle calling Lucrezia away, symbolize the inevitability of external influences disrupting the fragile balance of Del Sarto's life. Through a nuanced exploration of art, love, and ambition, Browning brings to life the complex inner world of a flawed but deeply human artist.
