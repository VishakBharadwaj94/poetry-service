## The Happiest Day by Edgar Allan Poe

```
The happiest day--the happiest hour
  My seared and blighted heart hath known,
The highest hope of pride and power,
  I feel hath flown.

Of power! said I? Yes! such I ween
  But they have vanished long, alas!
The visions of my youth have been--
  But let them pass.

And pride, what have I now with thee?
  Another brow may ev'n inherit
The venom thou hast poured on me--
  Be still my spirit!

The happiest day--the happiest hour
  Mine eyes shall see--have ever seen
The brightest glance of pride and power
  I feel have been:

But were that hope of pride and power
  Now offered with the pain
Ev'n _then_ I felt--that brightest hour
  I would not live again:

For on its wing was dark alloy
  And as it fluttered--fell
An essence--powerful to destroy
  A soul that knew it well.
```

The poem "The Happiest Day" by Edgar Allan Poe is a melancholic reflection on lost hope, pride, and power. Structurally, the poem consists of four stanzas, each with four lines. This consistent structure creates a sense of stability and balance in the poem, contrasting with the tumultuous emotions expressed within the verses.

In terms of meter, the poem follows a regular pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables, giving it a rhythmic flow. The rhyme scheme is ABAB, with the second and fourth lines of each stanza rhyming. This rhyme scheme adds a musical quality to the poem, enhancing its lyrical nature.

### Themes and Imagery

The speaker reflects on a time when they experienced the "happiest day" and "happiest hour," only to have their hopes of pride and power dashed. The imagery of a "seared and blighted heart" conveys a sense of deep emotional pain and suffering.

The poem also explores the themes of youth, pride, and power. The speaker acknowledges the transience of these qualities, as they lament the visions of their youth fading away and the venom of pride poisoning their spirit. The imagery of a "brightest glance of pride and power" symbolizes moments of success and achievement that ultimately prove to be fleeting and tainted.

### Literary Devices

Poe employs several literary devices to enhance the emotional impact of the poem. One notable device is the use of alliteration, as seen in the repetition of the "happiest day" and "happiest hour," emphasizing the fleeting nature of happiness. The metaphor of power as a wing that carries both joy and darkness adds depth to the speaker's reflections on their past experiences.

Another literary device used in the poem is personification, particularly in the lines "Another brow may ev'n inherit / The venom thou hast poured on me." Here, pride is personified as a malevolent force that has inflicted harm on the speaker. This personification adds a dramatic element to the speaker's internal struggle with their emotions.

### Historical and Personal Context

The poem also reflects the broader cultural context of the Romantic era, with its emphasis on individual emotion and introspection. The Romantic movement valued personal expression and the exploration of inner turmoil, both of which are evident in Poe's work.

### Deep Reading

At its core, "The Happiest Day" is a meditation on the fleeting nature of happiness and the inevitable disillusionment that accompanies the pursuit of power and pride. The speaker's reflections on past moments of joy underscore the transient nature of human experience, as even the brightest moments are tinged with darkness.

The poem serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of placing too much emphasis on external markers of success and validation. The speaker's rejection of reliving their "brightest hour" highlights the transformative power of pain and suffering, suggesting that true growth and self-awareness can only come through facing adversity.

Overall, "The Happiest Day" delves into the complexities of human emotion and the inevitability of loss and disillusionment. Through its introspective tone and vivid imagery, the poem invites readers to contemplate the nature of happiness and the true source of inner fulfillment.

## The Night Journey by Rupert Brooke

```
Hands and lit faces eddy to a line;
The dazed last minutes click; the clamour dies.
Beyond the great-swung arc o' the roof, divine,
Night, smoky-scarv'd, with thousand coloured eyes

Glares the imperious mystery of the way.
Thirsty for dark, you feel the long-limbed train
Throb, stretch, thrill motion, slide, pull out and sway,
Strain for the far, pause, draw to strength again. . . .

As a man, caught by some great hour, will rise,
Slow-limbed, to meet the light or find his love;
And, breathing long, with staring sightless eyes,
Hands out, head back, agape and silent, move

Sure as a flood, smooth as a vast wind blowing;
And, gathering power and purpose as he goes,
Unstumbling, unreluctant, strong, unknowing,
Borne by a will not his, that lifts, that grows,

Sweep out to darkness, triumphing in his goal,
Out of the fire, out of the little room. . . .
-- There is an end appointed, O my soul!
Crimson and green the signals burn; the gloom

Is hung with steam's far-blowing livid streamers.
Lost into God, as lights in light, we fly,
Grown one with will, end-drunken huddled dreamers.
The white lights roar. The sounds of the world die.

And lips and laughter are forgotten things.
Speed sharpens; grows. Into the night, and on,
The strength and splendour of our purpose swings.
The lamps fade; and the stars. We are alone.
```
