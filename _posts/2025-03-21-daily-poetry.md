## Our journey had advanced -- by Emily Dickinson

```
Our journey had advanced --
Our feet were almost come
To that odd Fork in Being's Road --
Eternity -- by Term --

Our pace took sudden awe --
Our feet -- reluctant -- led --
Before -- were Cities -- but Between --
The Forest of the Dead --

Retreat -- was out of Hope --
Behind -- a Sealed Route --
Eternity's White Flag -- Before --
And God -- at every Gate --
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

This poem by Emily Dickinson consists of four quatrains with a regular rhyme scheme of ABCB. The meter is predominantly iambic tetrameter, with four iambs (unstressed syllable followed by a stressed syllable) in each line. This regular structure gives the poem a sense of stability and control, mirroring the idea of a journey progressing steadily towards a destination. The consistent rhyme scheme also contributes to the poem's musicality and cohesion.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem revolves around the concept of a journey towards an uncertain destination, possibly symbolic of life's journey towards death or the afterlife. The imagery of the "odd Fork in Being's Road" represents a crucial juncture or decision point in life's path. The mention of "Eternity" and "The Forest of the Dead" conveys a sense of mystery, fear, and inevitability associated with the unknown future. The poem explores themes of mortality, uncertainty, and the presence of a higher power guiding or controlling human existence.

### Literary Devices

Dickinson employs several literary devices to enhance the meaning and impact of the poem. The use of personification is evident in lines such as "Eternity's White Flag" and "God -- at every Gate," where abstract concepts are given human-like qualities. Alliteration is also present in phrases like "Our pace took sudden awe," adding a rhythmic quality to the poem. The repeated use of dashes throughout the poem creates pauses and emphasizes certain words or ideas, adding a sense of fragmentation and uncertainty to the narrative.

### Historical and Personal Context

Emily Dickinson lived a reclusive life and her poetry often delves into themes of death, spirituality, and the afterlife. This poem reflects her preoccupation with mortality and the unknown, as well as her complex relationship with religious beliefs. The mention of "God" and "Eternity" suggests a spiritual undercurrent in the poem, which aligns with Dickinson's exploration of faith and existence in her work.

### Deep Reading

In a deeper analysis, the poem can be interpreted as a meditation on the inevitability of death and the existential journey of the soul. The mention of "Cities" and "The Forest of the Dead" suggests a transition from the familiar and tangible to the unknown and intangible realms of the afterlife. The reluctance of the feet to advance and the sense of awe and uncertainty reflect the human experience of facing mortality and the fear of the unknown. The presence of "God" at every gate symbolizes a divine presence or judgement awaiting the travelers at the end of their journey, adding a spiritual dimension to the poem's exploration of life, death, and eternity.

## Funeral Of Youth, The: Threnody by Rupert Brooke

```
The day that YOUTH had died,
There came to his grave-side,
In decent mourning, from the country's ends,
Those scatter'd friends
Who had lived the boon companions of his prime,
And laughed with him and sung with him and wasted,
In feast and wine and many-crown'd carouse,
The days and nights and dawnings of the time
When YOUTH kept open house,
Nor left untasted
Aught of his high emprise and ventures dear,
No quest of his unshar'd --
All these, with loitering feet and sad head bar'd,
Followed their old friend's bier.
FOLLY went first,
With muffled bells and coxcomb still revers'd;
And after trod the bearers, hat in hand --
LAUGHTER, most hoarse, and Captain PRIDE with tanned
And martial face all grim, and fussy JOY,
Who had to catch a train, and LUST, poor, snivelling boy;
These bore the dear departed.
Behind them, broken-hearted,
Came GRIEF, so noisy a widow, that all said,
"Had he but wed
Her elder sister SORROW, in her stead!"
And by her, trying to soothe her all the time,
The fatherless children, COLOUR, TUNE, and RHYME
(The sweet lad RHYME), ran all-uncomprehending.
Then, at the way's sad ending,
Round the raw grave they stay'd. Old WISDOM read,
In mumbling tone, the Service for the Dead.
There stood ROMANCE,
The furrowing tears had mark'd her rouged cheek;
Poor old CONCEIT, his wonder unassuaged;
Dead INNOCENCY's daughter, IGNORANCE;
And shabby, ill-dress'd GENEROSITY;
And ARGUMENT, too full of woe to speak;
PASSION, grown portly, something middle-aged;
And FRIENDSHIP -- not a minute older, she;
IMPATIENCE, ever taking out his watch;
FAITH, who was deaf, and had to lean, to catch
Old WISDOM's endless drone.
BEAUTY was there,
Pale in her black; dry-eyed; she stood alone.
Poor maz'd IMAGINATION; FANCY wild;
ARDOUR, the sunlight on his greying hair;
CONTENTMENT, who had known YOUTH as a child
And never seen him since. And SPRING came too,
Dancing over the tombs, and brought him flowers --
She did not stay for long.
And TRUTH, and GRACE, and all the merry crew,
The laughing WINDS and RIVERS, and lithe HOURS;
And HOPE, the dewy-eyed; and sorrowing SONG; --
Yes, with much woe and mourning general,
At dead YOUTH's funeral,
Even these were met once more together, all,
Who erst the fair and living YOUTH did know;
All, except only LOVE. LOVE had died long ago.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

In terms of form, Rupert Brooke's "Funeral Of Youth, The: Threnody" is a narrative poem that follows a structured and organized pattern. It consists of six stanzas, each with varying numbers of lines. The poem is written in free verse, meaning it does not adhere to a strict rhyme scheme or meter. This lack of formal structure mirrors the chaotic and mournful tone of the poem as it describes the funeral procession of Youth.

The irregularity in the number of lines in each stanza also adds to the sense of disorder and grief depicted in the poem. The lack of rhyme scheme contributes to the somber and melancholic atmosphere, allowing the focus to be on the content and themes of the poem rather than on any formal constraints.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem revolves around the passage of time and the inevitable loss of youth and innocence. Through vivid imagery and personification, Brooke portrays Youth as a beloved figure who is mourned by various abstract concepts and emotions, such as Folly, Laughter, Grief, Wisdom, and Beauty. The funeral procession serves as a metaphor for the end of youthful exuberance and the acceptance of mortality.

The imagery in the poem is rich and evocative, with descriptions of characters like Folly with "muffled bells and coxcomb still revers'd," and Grief as "so noisy a widow." Each character represents a different aspect of Youth that is now lost, adding depth and complexity to the poem's exploration of the passage of time and the fleeting nature of life.

### Literary Devices

Brooke employs several literary devices to enhance the thematic depth and emotional impact of the poem. Personification is a prominent device used throughout the poem, giving abstract concepts human-like qualities and allowing them to participate in the funeral procession as if they were living beings. This personification adds a sense of drama and poignancy to the poem.

Symbolism is another key literary device in the poem, with characters like Wisdom, Romance, and Beauty symbolizing different aspects of life and experience. The funeral procession itself serves as a powerful symbol of the end of Youth and the inevitability of mortality.

Additionally, the use of imagery, such as the description of Spring dancing over the tombs and the portrayal of Youth's children as personified concepts like Colour, Tune, and Rhyme, helps to create a vivid and emotionally resonant portrait of loss and remembrance.

### Historical and Personal Context

Rupert Brooke, a prominent English poet who lived during the early 20th century, was deeply affected by the events of World War I. His poetry often reflected themes of youth, beauty, and mortality, as well as a sense of nostalgia for a lost innocence. "Funeral Of Youth, The: Threnody" can be seen in this context as a reflection on the loss of innocence and the passing of time in the face of war and upheaval.

The poem also speaks to a broader cultural moment in which traditional values and beliefs were being challenged, and the certainties of the past were giving way to uncertainty and disillusionment. The funeral procession can be interpreted as a metaphor for the end of an era and the mourning of lost ideals and dreams.

### Deep Reading

At its core, "Funeral Of Youth, The: Threnody" is a poignant meditation on the transient nature of life and the inevitability of death. Through the funeral procession of Youth and the mournful gathering of abstract concepts and emotions, Brooke reflects on the passage of time, the loss of innocence, and the enduring power of memory.

The absence of Love at Youth's funeral serves as a poignant reminder of the ultimate loneliness and isolation that death brings. Despite the presence of various other emotions and experiences, Love remains conspicuously absent, highlighting the finality and irrevocability of death.

Overall, the poem invites readers to contemplate the fleeting nature of youth and the inevitability of mortality, urging them to cherish the present moment and appreciate the beauty and wonder of life before it is too late. Through its powerful imagery, emotional resonance, and thematic depth, "Funeral Of Youth, The: Threnody" continues to resonate with readers as a timeless meditation on the human experience.
