## Fragment: To the Moon by Percy Bysshe Shelley

```
Bright wanderer, fair coquette of Heaven,
To whom alone it has been given
To change and be adored for ever,
Envy not this dim world, for never
But once within its shadow grew
One fair as--
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

In this poem, "Fragment: To the Moon," Percy Bysshe Shelley employs a free verse form with irregular meter and rhyme scheme. The poem consists of a single stanza with six lines. The irregular meter and lack of a consistent rhyme scheme contribute to the dreamlike and ethereal quality of the poem, mirroring the fleeting and transient nature of the moon itself. The lack of a set structure reflects the theme of impermanence and change that runs throughout the poem.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem revolves around the transient nature of beauty and the fickle admiration it receives. Shelley addresses the moon as a "Bright wanderer" and a "fair coquette of Heaven," highlighting its ever-changing appearance and the adoration it receives from mortals. The imagery of the moon as a "bright wanderer" evokes a sense of mystery and allure, while the comparison to a "coquette" suggests a teasing and playful nature. The moon is portrayed as a celestial being that exists beyond the confines of the earthly world, envied for its eternal beauty.

### Literary Devices

Shelley employs several literary devices in this poem to convey his message effectively. The use of personification is evident in the portrayal of the moon as a "fair coquette of Heaven," attributing human-like qualities to the celestial body. The repetition of the word "never" in the lines "for never / But once within its shadow grew" emphasizes the rarity of finding true beauty in the world. Additionally, the use of enjambment in the final line creates a sense of incompleteness, leaving the reader to ponder the significance of the unfinished thought.

### Historical and Personal Context

Written in the early 19th century, Shelley's poem reflects the Romantic ideals of beauty, nature, and the ephemeral nature of existence. Shelley himself was a prominent Romantic poet known for his exploration of these themes in his works. The poem can be seen as a reflection of Shelley's own fascination with the natural world and his belief in the power of beauty to inspire and enchant.

### Deep Reading

At its core, "Fragment: To the Moon" serves as a meditation on the fleeting nature of beauty and the transience of admiration. By addressing the moon as a "Bright wanderer" and a "fair coquette of Heaven," Shelley highlights the ever-changing and elusive nature of beauty. The comparison of the moon to a celestial being underscores its otherworldly allure and the envy it evokes in mortals who can never attain its eternal beauty. Through the use of vivid imagery and evocative language, Shelley invites readers to contemplate the impermanence of beauty and the longing for that which is unattainable. The poem's open-ended conclusion leaves a sense of longing and contemplation, inviting readers to reflect on the ephemeral nature of existence and the enduring allure of beauty.

## The Young Soldier by Wilfred Owen

```
It is not death
Without hereafter
To one in dearth
Of life and its laughter,

Nor the sweet murder
Dealt slow and even
Unto the martyr
Smiling at heaven:

It is the smile
Faint as a (waning) myth,
Faint, and exceeding small
On a boy's murdered mouth.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme
The poem "The Young Soldier" by Wilfred Owen consists of three stanzas, each with four lines. The structure is simple yet effective in conveying the poet's message. The meter is irregular, with varying syllable counts in each line, adding to the sense of unpredictability and chaos that often accompanies war. 

There is no consistent rhyme scheme in the poem, contributing to a feeling of unease and disruption. However, the lack of rhyme also mirrors the harsh realities of war, where order and predictability are often absent.

### Themes and Imagery
One of the central themes of the poem is the senselessness and tragedy of war. Owen explores the idea that death in war is not the end but rather a continuation of suffering. The imagery used is powerful and evocative, depicting the young soldier's death as a "sweet murder" and highlighting the contrast between the brutality of war and the innocence of youth.

The image of the "smile / Faint as a myth" on the boy's face is particularly striking. It conveys the idea that even in the face of death, there is a fleeting moment of beauty and innocence that is quickly extinguished. This image serves as a poignant reminder of the loss of youth and potential that war brings.

### Literary Devices
Owen employs several literary devices to enhance the poem's impact. The use of alliteration in "sweet murder," "martyr smiling," and "boy's murdered mouth" creates a sense of rhythm and emphasis, drawing attention to the harsh realities of war. 

The repetition of the word "faint" emphasizes the fragility and fleeting nature of the smile on the young soldier's face, underscoring the tragic loss of innocence. Owen also uses personification in describing death as "smiling at heaven," adding a sense of irony and inevitability to the soldier's fate.

### Historical and Personal Context

"The Young Soldier" reflects the disillusionment and horror of war that Owen witnessed firsthand. The poem speaks to the sense of loss and despair that war brings, highlighting the devastating impact it has on young lives.

During World War I, many young soldiers were sent to fight in a conflict they did not fully understand, leading to widespread suffering and loss. Owen's poem captures the sense of futility and tragedy that characterized the war, shedding light on the human cost of conflict.

### Deep Reading
In "The Young Soldier," Wilfred Owen delves into the profound emotional and psychological toll of war on young soldiers. The image of the boy's "murdered mouth" encapsulates the brutality and senselessness of conflict, highlighting the tragic loss of innocence and potential. Owen's use of imagery, themes, and literary devices creates a haunting portrait of the impact of war on the individual, underscoring the need to remember and honor those who have sacrificed their lives in the service of their country.

Overall, "The Young Soldier" is a poignant and powerful reflection on the devastating effects of war, serving as a reminder of the human cost of conflict and the importance of peace.

## Talk not to me of Summer Trees by Emily Dickinson

```
Talk not to me of Summer Trees
The foliage of the mind
A Tabernacle is for Birds
Of no corporeal kind
And winds do go that way at noon
To their Ethereal Homes
Whose Bugles call the least of us
To undepicted Realms
```
