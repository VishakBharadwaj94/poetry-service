## Disabled by Wilfred Owen

```
He sat in a wheeled chair, waiting for dark,
And shivered in his ghastly suit of grey,
Legless, sewn short at elbow.  Through the park
Voices of boys rang saddening like a hymn,
Voices of play and pleasure after day,
Till gathering sleep had mothered them from him.

About this time Town used to swing so gay
When glow-lamps budded in the light-blue trees
And girls glanced lovelier as the air grew dim,
-- In the old times, before he threw away his knees.
Now he will never feel again how slim
Girls' waists are, or how warm their subtle hands,
All of them touch him like some queer disease.

There was an artist silly for his face,
For it was younger than his youth, last year.
Now he is old; his back will never brace;
He's lost his colour very far from here,
Poured it down shell-holes till the veins ran dry,
And half his lifetime lapsed in the hot race,
And leap of purple spurted from his thigh.
One time he liked a bloodsmear down his leg,
After the matches carried shoulder-high.
It was after football, when he'd drunk a peg,
He thought he'd better join.  He wonders why . . .
Someone had said he'd look a god in kilts.

That's why; and maybe, too, to please his Meg,
Aye, that was it, to please the giddy jilts,
He asked to join.  He didn't have to beg;
Smiling they wrote his lie; aged nineteen years.
Germans he scarcely thought of; and no fears
Of Fear came yet.  He thought of jewelled hilts
For daggers in plaid socks; of smart salutes;
And care of arms; and leave; and pay arrears;
Esprit de corps; and hints for young recruits.
And soon, he was drafted out with drums and cheers.

Some cheered him home, but not as crowds cheer Goal.
Only a solemn man who brought him fruits
Thanked him; and then inquired about his soul.
Now, he will spend a few sick years in Institutes,
And do what things the rules consider wise,
And take whatever pity they may dole.
To-night he noticed how the women's eyes
Passed from him to the strong men that were whole.
How cold and late it is!  Why don't they come
And put him into bed?  Why don't they come?
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "Disabled" by Wilfred Owen consists of seven stanzas, each with a varying number of lines. The irregular structure of the poem mirrors the disjointed and fragmented thoughts of the disabled soldier. The lack of a consistent meter and rhyme scheme also adds to the chaotic and disorienting feeling of the poem. 

The poem is written in free verse, allowing Owen to convey the soldier's inner turmoil and sense of isolation. The enjambment in the poem further emphasizes the soldier's disjointed and fragmented state of mind. For example, in the lines "He's lost his colour very far from here, / Poured it down shell-holes till the veins ran dry," the enjambment creates a sense of continuous flow, mirroring the soldier's memories and experiences.

### Themes and Imagery

One of the central themes of the poem is the devastating impact of war on individuals, particularly on young soldiers who are physically and emotionally scarred. The imagery in the poem vividly depicts the soldier's physical disability, as seen in lines such as "Legless, sewn short at elbow" and "lost his colour very far from here." This imagery serves to highlight the soldier's loss of identity and sense of self.

The poem also explores themes of isolation, alienation, and the disillusionment that comes with realizing the harsh realities of war. The contrast between the soldier's past memories of joy and vitality and his current state of despair and loneliness is striking. The imagery of the soldier waiting for darkness and feeling cold and abandoned further reinforces these themes.

### Literary Devices

Owen employs various literary devices to convey the emotional depth of the poem. The use of simile is evident in lines like "All of them touch him like some queer disease," where the soldier's physical disability is likened to a disease that repels others. This comparison serves to highlight the soldier's sense of alienation and isolation.

The poem also includes imagery of youth and vitality juxtaposed with images of decay and despair. The soldier's memories of happier times contrast sharply with his current reality, emphasizing the profound impact of war on his physical and emotional well-being.

Owen uses irony in the depiction of the soldier's decision to join the war out of a desire to impress others and feel a sense of belonging. The irony lies in the fact that his decision ultimately leads to his physical and emotional destruction, highlighting the futility and senselessness of war.

### Historical and Personal Context

Wilfred Owen was a soldier in World War I and wrote "Disabled" based on his own experiences and observations of the devastating effects of war. The poem reflects the disillusionment and trauma faced by soldiers who returned home physically and mentally scarred. Owen's personal connection to the subject matter adds depth and authenticity to the poem, allowing readers to glimpse the harsh realities of war through his eyes.

The historical context of World War I, known for its brutal trench warfare and high casualty rates, sheds light on the experiences of soldiers like the protagonist of the poem. The aftermath of the war left many young men disabled and traumatized, struggling to reintegrate into society and come to terms with their physical and emotional scars.

### Deep Reading

"Disabled" delves deep into the psychological and emotional impact of war on individuals, particularly young soldiers who were thrust into the horrors of battle. The poem explores themes of identity, loss, disillusionment, and the harsh realities of war. Through vivid imagery and poignant language, Owen paints a haunting portrait of a disabled soldier grappling with his physical and emotional wounds.

The juxtaposition of the soldier's past memories of youth and vitality with his current state of isolation and despair highlights the profound transformation brought about by war. The poem serves as a powerful commentary on the senseless destruction and human cost of conflict, urging readers to confront the harsh truths of war and its lasting effects on individuals and society.

Overall, "Disabled" is a poignant and moving portrayal of the physical and emotional toll of war, shedding light on the personal struggles and sacrifices of those who have experienced its horrors firsthand. Through its evocative imagery and heartfelt language, the poem invites readers to empathize with the soldier's plight and reflect on the profound impact of war on individuals and humanity as a whole.

## Life's Tragedy by Paul Laurence Dunbar

```
It may be misery not to sing at all,
And to go silent through the brimming day;
It may be misery never to be loved,
But deeper griefs than these beset the way.

To sing the perfect song,
And by a half-tone lost the key,
There the potent sorrow, there the grief,
The pale, sad staring of Life's Tragedy.

To have come near to the perfect love,
Not the hot passion of untempered youth,
But that which lies aside its vanity,
And gives, for thy trusting worship, truth.

This, this indeed is to be accursed,
For if we mortals love, or if we sing,
We count our joys not by what we have,
But by what kept us from that perfect thing.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "Life's Tragedy" by Paul Laurence Dunbar is written in four stanzas, each consisting of four lines. The rhyme scheme of the poem is ABAB, with alternating rhymes in each stanza. The consistent structure and rhyme scheme give the poem a sense of symmetry and balance, reflecting the theme of seeking perfection and the tragedy that can result from falling short.

In terms of meter, the poem follows a predominantly iambic tetrameter, with lines having eight syllables each. This regular meter adds a musical quality to the poem, emphasizing the themes of singing and love that are central to the poem's message.

### Themes and Imagery

The central themes of the poem revolve around the idea of longing for perfection in love and art, and the tragedy that ensues when this perfection is not achieved. The speaker reflects on the misery of not being able to fully express oneself through singing or being loved, but suggests that the deepest grief comes from coming close to perfection but ultimately falling short.

The imagery in the poem is vivid and evocative, painting a picture of sorrow and yearning. The image of going silent through the "brimming day" conveys a sense of missed opportunities and unfulfilled potential. The idea of singing the perfect song only to lose the key by a half-tone symbolizes the fleeting nature of perfection and the sorrow that comes with it.

### Literary Devices

Dunbar employs several literary devices to convey the themes of the poem effectively. One notable device is the use of contrast, such as contrasting the "hot passion of untempered youth" with the more mature and enduring love that the speaker desires. This contrast highlights the speaker's longing for a deeper, more meaningful connection.

The poem also features imagery and personification to create a sense of emotional depth. The personification of Life's Tragedy as a figure that causes "pale, sad staring" emphasizes the profound impact of falling short of perfection in love and art.

### Historical and Personal Context

Paul Laurence Dunbar, an African American poet, often explored themes of love, loss, and longing in his work. As a writer who faced racial discrimination and personal struggles, Dunbar's poetry often reflects the complexities of the human experience and the challenges of striving for perfection in a flawed world.

The themes of unrequited love and the pursuit of artistic excellence in "Life's Tragedy" may also resonate with Dunbar's own experiences of longing for acceptance and recognition in a society that marginalized African American voices.

### Deep Reading

At its core, "Life's Tragedy" delves into the universal human experience of longing for perfection in love and art, only to be met with the harsh reality of imperfection and loss. The speaker's lament over missed opportunities and unattainable ideals speaks to the inherent vulnerability and fragility of the human condition.

The poem serves as a poignant reminder of the bittersweet nature of life, where joy is measured not by what we have but by what we long for and cannot attain. Through its introspective tone and evocative imagery, "Life's Tragedy" invites readers to reflect on the complexities of desire, grief, and the pursuit of perfection in a world fraught with limitations.
