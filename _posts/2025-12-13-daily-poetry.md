## Summer in the South by Paul Laurence Dunbar

```
The Oriole sings in the greening grove
As if he were half-way waiting,
The rosebuds peep from their hoods of green,
Timid, and hesitating.
The rain comes down in a torrent sweep
And the nights smell warm and pinety,
The garden thrives, but the tender shoots
Are yellow-green and tiny.
Then a flash of sun on a waiting hill,
Streams laugh that erst were quiet,
The sky smiles down with a dazzling blue
And the woods run mad with riot.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme
In "Summer in the South," Paul Laurence Dunbar employs a traditional rhyming scheme of ABABCC, with alternating rhymes in the first four lines and a rhyming couplet at the end. The poem consists of seven quatrains, each with a consistent structure of alternating tetrameter and trimeter lines. The meter is predominantly iambic, creating a smooth and flowing rhythm throughout the poem. This regular structure and meter contribute to the poem's musicality and make it a pleasure to read aloud.

### Themes and Imagery
The central theme of "Summer in the South" revolves around the arrival of summer in the southern region. Dunbar vividly captures the transition from spring to summer through rich imagery. The poem paints a picture of nature coming to life, with images of orioles singing, rosebuds blooming, rain falling, and the sun breaking through the clouds. The juxtaposition of elements like rain and sun, growth and stagnation, creates a sense of tension and anticipation, echoing the cyclical nature of seasons.

### Literary Devices
Dunbar incorporates several literary devices to enhance the poem's imagery and meaning. Alliteration is present in phrases like "torrent sweep" and "yellow-green," adding a musical quality to the language. Personification is used to anthropomorphize nature, as seen in lines like "Streams laugh that erst were quiet" and "the sky smiles down." Additionally, the use of similes, such as "as if he were half-way waiting," helps to create vivid comparisons that bring the scenes to life.

### Historical and Personal Context
As an African American poet writing in the late 19th century, Dunbar faced significant challenges due to racial discrimination. Despite these obstacles, he achieved recognition for his poetry, which often explored themes of nature, love, and racial identity. "Summer in the South" reflects Dunbar's deep connection to nature and his ability to find beauty and joy in the world around him, even in the face of adversity. The poem also serves as a celebration of the natural world and the changing of seasons, highlighting the beauty and wonder of the southern landscape.

### Deep Reading
On a deeper level, "Summer in the South" can be seen as a reflection of the cyclical nature of life and the inevitability of change. The poem captures the fleeting beauty of summer, with its vibrant colors and sounds, while also hinting at the impermanence of these moments. The contrast between growth and decay, warmth and coolness, creates a sense of balance and harmony in the natural world. By immersing the reader in this sensory experience, Dunbar invites us to appreciate the beauty of the present moment and savor the fleeting joys of life.

## Lord Walter's Wife by Elizabeth Barrett Browning

```
I

'But where do you go?' said the lady, while both sat under the yew,
And her eyes were alive in their depth, as the kraken beneath the sea-blue.

II

'Because I fear you,' he answered;--'because you are far too fair,
And able to strangle my soul in a mesh of your golfd-coloured hair.'

III

'Oh that,' she said, 'is no reason! Such knots are quickly undone,
And too much beauty, I reckon, is nothing but too much sun.'

IV

'Yet farewell so,' he answered; --'the sunstroke's fatal at times.
I value your husband, Lord Walter, whose gallop rings still from the limes.

V

'Oh that,' she said, 'is no reason. You smell a rose through a fence:
If two should smell it what matter? who grumbles, and where's the pretense?

VI

'But I,' he replied, 'have promised another, when love was free,
To love her alone, alone, who alone from afar loves me.'

VII

'Why, that,' she said, 'is no reason. Love's always free I am told.
Will you vow to be safe from the headache on Tuesday, and think it will hold?

VIII

'But you,' he replied, 'have a daughter, a young child, who was laid
In your lap to be pure; so I leave you: the angels would make me afraid."

IX

'Oh that,' she said, 'is no reason. The angels keep out of the way;
And Dora, the child, observes nothing, although you should please me and stay.'

X

At which he rose up in his anger,--'Why now, you no longer are fair!
Why, now, you no longer are fatal, but ugly and hateful, I swear.'

XI

At which she laughed out in her scorn: 'These men! Oh these men overnice,
Who are shocked if a colour not virtuous is frankly put on by a vice.'

XII

Her eyes blazed upon him--'And you! You bring us your vices so near
That we smell them! You think in our presence a thought 'twould defame us to hear!

XIII

'What reason had you, and what right,--I appel to your soul from my life,--
To find me so fair as a woman? Why, sir, I am pure, and a wife.

XIV

'Is the day-star too fair up above you? It burns you not. Dare you imply
I brushed you more close than the star does, when Walter had set me as high?

XV

'If a man finds a woman too fair, he means simply adapted too much
To use unlawful and fatal. The praise! --shall I thank you for such?

XVI

'Too fair?--not unless you misuse us! and surely if, once in a while,
You attain to it, straightaway you call us no longer too fair, but too vile.

XVII

'A moment,--I pray your attention!--I have a poor word in my head
I must utter, though womanly custom would set it down better unsaid.

XVIII

'You grew, sir, pale to impertinence, once when I showed you a ring.
You kissed my fan when I dropped it. No matter! I've broken the thing.

XIX

'You did me the honour, perhaps, to be moved at my side now and then
In the senses--a vice, I have heard, which is common to beasts and some men.

XX

'Love's a virtue for heroes!--as white as the snow on high hills,
And immortal as every great soul is that struggles, endures, and fulfils.

XXI
'I love my Walter profoundly,--you, Maude, though you faltered a week,
For the sake of . . . what is it--an eyebrow? or, less still, a mole on the cheek?

XXII
'And since, when all's said, you're too noble to stoop to the frivolous cant
About crimes irresistable, virtues that swindle, betray and supplant.

XXIII

'I determined to prove to yourself that, whate'er you might dream or avow
By illusion, you wanted precisely no more of me than you have now.

XXIV

'There! Look me full in the face!--in the face. Understand, if you can,
That the eyes of such women as I am are clean as the palm of a man.

XXV
'Drop his hand, you insult him. Avoid us for fear we should cost you a scar--
You take us for harlots, I tell you, and not for the women we are.

XXVI

'You wronged me: but then I considered . . . there's Walter! And so at the end
I vowed that he should not be mulcted, by me, in the hand of a friend.

XXVII

'Have I hurt you indeed? We are quits then. Nay, friend of my Walter, be mine!
Come, Dora, my darling, my angel, and help me to ask him to dine.'

## A Day Dream by Emily Bronte

```
On a sunny brae, alone I lay
One summer afternoon;
It was the marriage-time of May
With her young lover, June.

From her mother's heart, seemed loath to part
That queen of bridal charms,
But her father smiled on the fairest child
He ever held in his arms.

The trees did wave their plumy crests,
The glad birds caroled clear;
And I, of all the wedding guests,
Was only sullen there!

There was not one, but wished to shun
My aspect void of cheer;
The very grey rocks, looking on,
Asked, "What do you here?"

And I could utter no reply;
In sooth, I did not know
Why I had brought a clouded eye
To greet the general glow.

So, resting on a heathy bank,
I took my heart to me;
And we together sadly sank
Into a reverie.

We thought, "When winter comes again,
Where will these bright things be?
All vanished, like a vision vain,
An unreal mockery!

The birds that now so blithely sing,
Through deserts, frozen dry,
Poor spectres of the perished spring,
In famished troops, will fly.

And why should we be glad at all?
The leaf is hardly green,
Before a token of its fall
Is on the surface seen!"

Now, whether it were really so,
I never could be sure;
But as in fit of peevish woe,
I stretched me on the moor.

A thousand thousand gleaming fires
Seemed kindling in the air;
A thousand thousand silvery lyres
Resounded far and near:

Methought, the very breath I breathed
Was full of sparks divine,
And all my heather-couch was wreathed
By that celestial shine!

And, while the wide earth echoing rung
To their strange minstrelsy,
The little glittering spirits sung,
Or seemed to sing, to me.

"O mortal! mortal! let them die;
Let time and tears destroy,
That we may overflow the sky
With universal joy!

Let grief distract the sufferer's breast,
And night obscure his way;
They hasten him to endless rest,
And everlasting day.

To thee the world is like a tomb,
A desert's naked shore;
To us, in unimagined bloom,
It brightens more and more!

And could we lift the veil, and give
One brief glimpse to thine eye,
Thou wouldst rejoice for those that live,
Because they live to die."

The music ceased; the noonday dream,
Like dream of night, withdrew;
But Fancy, still, will sometimes deem
Her fond creation true.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

Emily Bronte's poem "A Day Dream" consists of 42 lines divided into six stanzas. The poem follows a consistent rhyme scheme of ABAB CDCD, with alternating rhyme pairs. This rhyme scheme creates a sense of harmony and balance within the poem. The meter is primarily iambic tetrameter, with four beats per line, contributing to a rhythmic flow that enhances the dream-like quality of the poem. The structured form of the poem mirrors the speaker's contemplative mood and adds to the overall coherence of the piece.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem revolves around the fleeting nature of beauty, life, and joy. Through vivid imagery, Bronte contrasts the ephemeral nature of the seasons and the cyclical passage of time with the eternal and transcendent qualities of the spiritual realm. The imagery of nature, such as the changing seasons, birds, and rocks, serves as a metaphor for the transience of human existence and the inevitability of death. The contrast between the earthly realm and the celestial realm highlights the speaker's contemplation of mortality and the afterlife.

### Literary Devices

Bronte employs various literary devices to enhance the thematic depth of the poem. Personification is used to imbue nature with human-like qualities, such as the trees waving their plumy crests and the rocks questioning the speaker's presence. This personification adds a sense of surrealism to the scene and underscores the speaker's alienation from the joyous occasion. Imagery is another prominent device, with descriptions of "a thousand thousand gleaming fires" and "silvery lyres" creating a sense of enchantment and otherworldliness. The use of symbolism, such as the heather-couch wreathed by celestial shine, conveys the speaker's spiritual awakening and connection to the divine.

### Historical and Personal Context

Emily Bronte, known for her introspective and imaginative poetry, often explored themes of nature, mortality, and spirituality in her work. As a member of the Romantic literary movement, Bronte's poetry reflects the era's fascination with nature, emotion, and the supernatural. "A Day Dream" can be seen as a reflection of Bronte's own contemplation of life's transience and the search for meaning in the face of mortality. The poem's exploration of the tension between earthly existence and spiritual enlightenment resonates with Bronte's personal struggles and philosophical beliefs.

### Deep Reading

At its core, "A Day Dream" delves into the existential questions of life, death, and the nature of reality. The speaker's contemplation of the fleeting nature of beauty and joy serves as a meditation on the impermanence of human existence. Through the contrast between the earthly realm of sorrow and the celestial realm of eternal joy, Bronte suggests a deeper spiritual truth about the cyclical nature of life and death. The celestial spirits' message to embrace mortality as a pathway to eternal bliss challenges conventional notions of grief and suffering, inviting the reader to ponder the interconnectedness of life and death. Ultimately, "A Day Dream" invites us to reflect on our own mortality and the possibility of transcendence through acceptance and spiritual awakening.
