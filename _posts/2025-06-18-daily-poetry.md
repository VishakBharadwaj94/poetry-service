## The Laboratory (Ancien Regime) by Robert Browning

```
Now that I, tying thy glass mask tightly,
May gaze through these faint smokes curling whitely,
As thou pliest thy trade in this devil's-smithy--
Which is the poison to poison her, prithee?

He is with her, and they know that I know
Where they are, what they do: they believe my tears flow
While they laugh, laugh at me, at me fled to the drear
Empty church, to pray God in, for them!--I am here!

Grind away, moisten and mash up thy paste,
Pound at thy powder, I am not in haste!
Better sit thus and observe thy strange things,
Than go where men wait me, and dance at the King's.

That in the mortar--you call it a gum?
Ah, the brave tree whence such gold oozings come!
And yonder soft phial, the exquisite blue,
Sure to taste sweetly,--is that poison, too?
Had I but all of them, thee and thy treasures,
What a wild crowd of Invisible pleasures!
To carry pure death in an earring, a casket,
A signet, a fan-mount, a filigree basket!

Soon, at the King's, a mere lozenge to give
And Pauline should have just thirty minutes to live!
But to light a pastille, and Elise, with her head
And her breast and her arms and her hands, should drop dead!

Quick--is it finished? The colour's too grim!
Why not soft like the phial's, enticing and dim?
Let it brighten her drink, let her turn it and stir,
And try it and taste, ere she fix and prefer!

What a drop! She's not little, no minion like me!
That's why she ensnared him: this never will free
The soul from those masculine eyes,--say "No!"
To that pulse's magnificent come-and-go.

For only last night, as they whispered, I brought
My own eyes to bear on her so that I thought
Could I keep them one half-minute fixed, she would fall
Shrivelled; she fell not: yet this does it all!

Not that I bid you spare her the pain;
Let death be felt and the proof remain:
Brand, burn up, bite into its grace--
He is sure to remember her dying face!

Is it done? Take my mask off! Nay, be not morose;
It kills her, and this prevents seeing it close:
The delicate droplet, my whole fortune's fee!
If it hurts her, beside, can it ever hurt me?

Now, take all my jewels, gorge gold to your fill,
You may kiss me, old man, on my mouth if you will!
But brush this dust off me, lest horror it brings
Ere I know it--next moment I dance at the King's!
```

The meter of the poem is predominantly iambic tetrameter, with four metrical feet per line. This consistent structure creates a sense of rhythm and flow throughout the poem, guiding the reader through the speaker's dark and obsessive thoughts.

### Themes and Imagery

The themes in this poem revolve around jealousy, revenge, obsession, and the destructive nature of desire. The speaker is consumed by jealousy towards a woman who has captured the attention of the man she desires. She seeks revenge by visiting a chemist's laboratory to acquire poisons that will bring about the woman's demise. The imagery in the poem is vivid and macabre, with descriptions of poisonous substances, elaborate jewels, and the speaker's twisted fantasies of death and destruction. The imagery of the laboratory itself serves as a metaphor for the speaker's inner turmoil and desire for control over the situation.

### Literary Devices

Browning uses several literary devices to enhance the themes and imagery of the poem. One prominent device is dramatic monologue, as the speaker directly addresses an implied listener, revealing her inner thoughts and emotions. The use of enjambment and caesura adds to the sense of urgency and tension in the speaker's narrative. Browning also employs alliteration, assonance, and metaphor to create a rich tapestry of language that conveys the speaker's obsession and malevolent intentions.

### Historical and Personal Context

The poem is set during the Ancien RÃ©gime in France, a period known for its decadence, extravagance, and social inequality. The speaker's fixation on wealth, status, and revenge reflects the values and attitudes of this era. Browning himself was influenced by the Romantic movement, which often explored themes of the darker aspects of human nature and the complexities of human relationships. The poem can also be seen as a critique of the power dynamics and moral decay of society at the time.

### Deep Reading

"The Laboratory" delves into the depths of human emotion, particularly jealousy and the desire for control. The speaker's obsession with revenge and the lengths she is willing to go to achieve it reveal a dark and twisted psyche. The poem raises questions about the nature of power, morality, and the consequences of unchecked ambition. The speaker's manipulation of poison as a means of asserting dominance over her rival highlights the destructive nature of envy and the tragic consequences of allowing it to consume one's soul. Ultimately, the poem serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of allowing jealousy and resentment to drive one's actions, leading to a path of self-destruction and moral decay.

## Mother and Poet by Elizabeth Barrett Browning

```
I.

Dead ! One of them shot by the sea in the east,
And one of them shot in the west by the sea.
Dead ! both my boys ! When you sit at the feast
And are wanting a great song for Italy free,
Let none look at me !

II.
Yet I was a poetess only last year,
And good at my art, for a woman, men said ;
But this woman, this, who is agonized here,
-- The east sea and west sea rhyme on in her head
For ever instead.

III.
What art can a woman be good at ? Oh, vain !
What art is she good at, but hurting her breast
With the milk-teeth of babes, and a smile at the pain ?
Ah boys, how you hurt ! you were strong as you pressed,
And I proud, by that test.

IV.
What art's for a woman ? To hold on her knees
Both darlings ! to feel all their arms round her throat,
Cling, strangle a little ! to sew by degrees
And 'broider the long-clothes and neat little coat ;
To dream and to doat.

V.
To teach them ... It stings there ! I made them indeed
Speak plain the word country. I taught them, no doubt,
That a country's a thing men should die for at need.
I prated of liberty, rights, and about
The tyrant cast out.

VI.
And when their eyes flashed ... O my beautiful eyes ! ...
I exulted ; nay, let them go forth at the wheels
Of the guns, and denied not. But then the surprise
When one sits quite alone ! Then one weeps, then one kneels !
God, how the house feels !

VII.
At first, happy news came, in gay letters moiled
With my kisses, -- of camp-life and glory, and how
They both loved me ; and, soon coming home to be spoiled
In return would fan off every fly from my brow
With their green laurel-bough.

VIII.
Then was triumph at Turin : `Ancona was free !'
And some one came out of the cheers in the street,
With a face pale as stone, to say something to me.
My Guido was dead ! I fell down at his feet,
While they cheered in the street.

IX.
I bore it ; friends soothed me ; my grief looked sublime
As the ransom of Italy. One boy remained
To be leant on and walked with, recalling the time
When the first grew immortal, while both of us strained
To the height he had gained.

X.
And letters still came, shorter, sadder, more strong,
Writ now but in one hand, `I was not to faint, --
One loved me for two -- would be with me ere long :
And Viva l' Italia ! -- he died for, our saint,
Who forbids our complaint."

XI.
My Nanni would add, `he was safe, and aware
Of a presence that turned off the balls, -- was imprest
It was Guido himself, who knew what I could bear,
And how 'twas impossible, quite dispossessed,
To live on for the rest."

XII.
On which, without pause, up the telegraph line
Swept smoothly the next news from Gaeta : -- Shot.
Tell his mother. Ah, ah, ` his, ' ` their ' mother, -- not ` mine, '
No voice says "My mother" again to me. What !
You think Guido forgot ?

XIII.
Are souls straight so happy that, dizzy with Heaven,
They drop earth's affections, conceive not of woe ?
I think not. Themselves were too lately forgiven
Through THAT Love and Sorrow which reconciled so
The Above and Below.

XIV.
O Christ of the five wounds, who look'dst through the dark
To the face of Thy mother ! consider, I pray,
How we common mothers stand desolate, mark,
Whose sons, not being Christs, die with eyes turned away,
And no last word to say !

XV.
Both boys dead ? but that's out of nature. We all
Have been patriots, yet each house must always keep one.
'Twere imbecile, hewing out roads to a wall ;
And, when Italy 's made, for what end is it done
If we have not a son ?

XVI.
Ah, ah, ah ! when Gaeta's taken, what then ?
When the fair wicked queen sits no more at her sport
Of the fire-balls of death crashing souls out of men ?
When the guns of Cavalli with final retort
Have cut the game short ?

XVII.
When Venice and Rome keep their new jubilee,
When your flag takes all heaven for its white, green, and red,
When you have your country from mountain to sea,
When King Victor has Italy's crown on his head,
(And I have my Dead) --

XVIII.
What then ? Do not mock me. Ah, ring your bells low,
And burn your lights faintly ! My country is there,
Above the star pricked by the last peak of snow :
My Italy 's THERE, with my brave civic Pair,
To disfranchise despair !

XIX.
Forgive me. Some women bear children in strength,
And bite back the cry of their pain in self-scorn ;
But the birth-pangs of nations will wring us at length
Into wail such as this -- and we sit on forlorn
When the man-child is born.

XX.
Dead ! One of them shot by the sea in the east,
And one of them shot in the west by the sea.
Both ! both my boys ! If in keeping the feast
You want a great song for your Italy free,
Let none look at me !


[This was Laura Savio, of Turin, a poetess and patriot, whose sonswere killed at Ancona and Gaeta.]

## Merry Autumn by Paul Laurence Dunbar

```
It's all a farce,âthese tales they tell
  About the breezes sighing,
And moans astir o'er field and dell,
  Because the year is dying.

Such principles are most absurd,â
  I care not who first taught 'em;
There's nothing known to beast or bird
  To make a solemn autumn.

In solemn times, when grief holds sway
  With countenance distressing,
You'll note the more of black and gray
  Will then be used in dressing.

Now purple tints are all around;
  The sky is blue and mellow;
And e'en the grasses turn the ground
  From modest green to yellow.

The seed burs all with laughter crack
  On featherweed and jimson;
And leaves that should be dressed in black
  Are all decked out in crimson.

A butterfly goes winging by;
  A singing bird comes after;
And Nature, all from earth to sky,
  Is bubbling o'er with laughter.

The ripples wimple on the rills,
  Like sparkling little lasses;
The sunlight runs along the hills,
  And laughs among the grasses.

The earth is just so full of fun
  It really can't contain it;
And streams of mirth so freely run
  The heavens seem to rain it.

Don't talk to me of solemn days
  In autumn's time of splendor,
Because the sun shows fewer rays,
  And these grow slant and slender.

Why, it's the climax of the year,â
  The highest time of living!â
Till naturally its bursting cheer
  Just melts into thanksgiving.
```

### Word Suggestions

Consider these word pairs that complement your poem's tone:

- **guess** (Germanic) / **estimate** (Latinate)
  - *While 'guess' implies a more casual and uncertain approach to determining something, 'estimate' carries a tone of precision and calculation. 'Guess' may evoke a sense of whimsy and spontaneity, whereas 'estimate' conveys a more serious and deliberate assessment.*
  - **Recommended:** Use the latinate version to enhance your poem's tone

- **foe** (Germanic) / **enemy** (Latinate)
  - *'Foe' has a slightly archaic or poetic feel, often used to describe an adversary in a more literary context. In contrast, 'enemy' is a more commonly used term that directly signifies opposition or hostility. 'Foe' may add a touch of elegance or nostalgia, while 'enemy' is more straightforward and modern.*
  - **Recommended:** Use the latinate version to enhance your poem's tone

- **belive** (Germanic) / **remain** (Latinate)
  - *While 'belive' is an uncommon word in modern English, 'remain' is widely understood and used. 'Belive' may sound more poetic and evoke a sense of old-world charm, while 'remain' is clear and unambiguous in its meaning. Using 'belive' could add a sense of mystique or antiquity to the poem.*
