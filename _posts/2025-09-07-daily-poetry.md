## Could Hope inspect her Basis by Emily Dickinson

Could Hope inspect her Basis
Her Craft were done --
Has a fictitious Charter
Or it has none --

Balked in the vastest instance
But to renew --
Felled by but one assassin --
Prosperity --

## The Valley Of Unrest by Edgar Allan Poe

```
_Once_ it smiled a silent dell
Where the people did not dwell;
They had gone unto the wars,
Trusting to the mild-eyed stars,
Nightly, from their azure towers,
To keep watch above the flowers,
In the midst of which all day
The red sun-light lazily lay,
_Now_ each visitor shall confess
The sad valley's restlessness.
Nothing there is motionless--
Nothing save the airs that brood
Over the magic solitude.
Ah, by no wind are stirred those trees
That palpitate like the chill seas
Around the misty Hebrides!
Ah, by no wind those clouds are driven
That rustle through the unquiet Heaven
Unceasingly, from morn till even,
Over the violets there that lie
In myriad types of the human eye--
Over the lilies that wave
And weep above a nameless grave!
They wave:--from out their fragrant tops
Eternal dews come down in drops.
They weep:--from off their delicate stems
Perennial tears descend in gems.
```

The use of enjambment, where sentences and phrases continue from one line to the next without punctuation, adds to the flowing and uninterrupted feel of the poem.

### Themes and Imagery

One of the central themes in "The Valley of Unrest" is the idea of restlessness and unease.

The imagery in the poem is vivid and evocative, drawing on elements of nature to convey a sense of melancholy and decay. The description of the trees that "palpitate like the chill seas" and the clouds that "rustle through the unquiet Heaven" paints a picture of a desolate and eerie landscape.
