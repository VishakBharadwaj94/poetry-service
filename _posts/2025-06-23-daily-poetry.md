## Moonlight, summer moonlight by Emily Bronte

```
'Tis moonlight, summer moonlight,
All soft and still and fair;
The solemn hour of midnight
Breathes sweet thoughts everywhere,

But most where trees are sending
Their breezy boughs on high,
Or stooping low are lending
A shelter from the sky.

And there in those wild bowers
A lovely form is laid;
Green grass and dew-steeped flowers
Wave gently round her head.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

Emily Bronte's poem "Moonlight, summer moonlight" is structured as a four-stanza poem with a consistent rhyme scheme of AABB.

This rhythmic pattern contributes to the gentle and flowing nature of the poem, mirroring the peaceful and tranquil mood evoked by the imagery of moonlit summer nights.

### Themes and Imagery

The imagery of the moonlight, soft and still, creates a sense of calm and serenity, while the mention of trees and wild bowers adds a touch of mystery and enchantment to the scene. The image of a "lovely form" laid among green grass and dew-steeped flowers conveys a sense of peaceful repose and harmony with the natural world.

Bronte employs several literary devices to enhance the poem's imagery and mood. The use of alliteration in phrases like "soft and still and fair" and "green grass and dew-steeped flowers" creates a musical quality and reinforces the gentle, soothing atmosphere of the poem.

### Historical and Personal Context

Emily Bronte, known for her introspective and nature-inspired poetry, likely drew inspiration from her own experiences and observations of the natural world. The Romantic movement of the 19th century, which celebrated nature's beauty and its ability to evoke deep emotions, may have influenced Bronte's portrayal of the moonlit summer night as a time of reflection and tranquility.

Overall, "Moonlight, summer moonlight" by Emily Bronte is a poignant and evocative poem that captures the timeless beauty of nature and the profound sense of connection it can inspire within us.

## Home by Rupert Brooke

```
I came back late and tired last night
Into my little room,
To the long chair and the firelight
And comfortable gloom.

But as I entered softly in
I saw a woman there,
The line of neck and cheek and chin,
The darkness of her hair,
The form of one I did not know
Sitting in my chair.

I stood a moment fierce and still,
Watching her neck and hair.
I made a step to her; and saw
That there was no one there.

It was some trick of the firelight
That made me see her there.
It was a chance of shade and light
And the cushion in the chair.

Oh, all you happy over the earth,
That night, how could I sleep?
I lay and watched the lonely gloom;
And watched the moonlight creep
From wall to basin, round the room,
All night I could not sleep.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme
The poem "Home" by Rupert Brooke is written in free verse, lacking a consistent rhyme scheme or meter. The lack of a strict structure mirrors the speaker's sense of disorientation and unease upon returning home to find a mysterious woman in his room. The irregularity of the form adds to the overall sense of tension and confusion in the poem.

### Themes and Imagery
The central theme of the poem revolves around the idea of home being a place of comfort and familiarity, which is disrupted by the unexpected presence of a stranger. The imagery in the poem is vivid and evocative, with descriptions of the woman's physical features such as her neck, hair, and chin creating a sense of mystery and intrigue. The contrast between the cozy firelight and the unsettling presence of the unknown woman adds to the overall atmosphere of unease and suspense.

### Literary Devices
Brooke employs several literary devices in the poem to enhance its meaning and impact. The use of personification is evident in the description of the firelight and the moonlight creeping around the room, giving these inanimate objects a sense of agency and movement. The repeated use of the word "watched" emphasizes the speaker's sense of vigilance and unease in the face of the unknown presence in his home.

### Historical and Personal Context
Rupert Brooke was a poet associated with the early 20th-century Georgian poets, known for their focus on nature, beauty, and a sense of nostalgia for a simpler past. Brooke's personal experiences, including his travels and relationships, often influenced his poetry. In the case of "Home," it is likely that the poem reflects Brooke's own feelings of displacement and alienation, perhaps stemming from his own experiences of returning home to find things changed or unfamiliar.

### Deep Reading
On a deeper level, "Home" can be interpreted as a meditation on the fragility of our sense of security and belonging. The sudden appearance of the unknown woman in the speaker's home disrupts his sense of comfort and routine, forcing him to confront the unknown and unsettling aspects of life. The poem suggests that even the most familiar and intimate spaces can become strange and unsettling under certain circumstances, highlighting the vulnerability of our sense of home and belonging. Ultimately, "Home" speaks to the universal experience of feeling out of place or unsettled in one's own surroundings, inviting readers to consider the complexities of the concept of home and the ways in which it can be both comforting and disorienting.
