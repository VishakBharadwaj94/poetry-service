## Epilogue to "Asolando" by Robert Browning

```
At the midnight in the silence of the sleep-time,
  When you set your fancies free,
Will they pass to where--by death, fools think, imprisoned--
Low he lies who once so loved you whom you loved so,
        --Pity me?

Oh to love so, be so loved, yet so mistaken!
  What had I on earth to do
With the slothful, with the mawkish, the unmanly?
Like the aimless, helpless, hopeless, did I drivel
          --Being--who?

One who never turned his back but marched breast forward,
  Never doubted clouds would break,
Never dreamed, tho' right were worsted, wrong would triumph,
  Held we fall to rise, are baffled to fight better,
          Sleep to wake.

No, at noonday in the bustle of man's work-time
  Greet the unseen with a cheer!
Bid him forward, breast and back as either should be,
  "Strive and thrive!" cry "Speed,--fight on, fare ever
          There as here!"
```

## A Letter to a Live Poet by Rupert Brooke

```
Sir, since the last Elizabethan died,
Or, rather, that more Paradisal muse,
Blind with much light, passed to the light more glorious
Or deeper blindness, no man's hand, as thine,
Has, on the world's most noblest chord of song,
Struck certain magic strains. Ears satiate
With the clamorous, timorous whisperings of to-day,
Thrilled to perceive once more the spacious voice
And serene unterrance of old. We heard
-- With rapturous breath half-held, as a dreamer dreams
Who dares not know it dreaming, lest he wake --
The odorous, amorous style of poetry,
The melancholy knocking of those lines,
The long, low soughing of pentameters,
-- Or the sharp of rhyme as a bird's cry --
And the innumerable truant polysyllables
Multitudinously twittering like a bee.
Fulfilled our hearts were with the music then,
And all the evenings sighed it to the dawn,
And all the lovers heard it from all the trees.
All of the accents upon the all the norms!
-- And ah! the stress of the penultimate!
We never knew blank verse could have such feet.

Where is it now? Oh, more than ever, now
I sometimes think no poetry is read
Save where some sepultured Cѕsura bled,
Royally incarnadining all the line.
Is the imperial iamb laid to rest,
And the young trochee, having done enough?
Ah! turn again! Sing so to us, who are sick
Of seeming-simple rhymes, bizarre emotions,
Decked in the simple verses of the day,
Infinite meaning in a little gloom,
Irregular thoughts in stanzas regular,
Modern despair in antique metres, myths
Incomprehensible at evening,
And symbols that mean nothing in the dawn.
The slow lines swell. The new style sighs. The Celt
Moans round with many voices.
God! to see
Gaunt anapѕsts stand up out of the verse,
Combative accents, stress where no stress should be,
Spondee on spondee, iamb on choriamb,
The thrill of all the tribrachs in the world,
And all the vowels rising to the E!
To hear the blessed mutter of those verbs,
Conjunctions passionate toward each other's arms,
And epithets like amaranthine lovers
Stretching luxuriously to the stars,
All prouder pronouns than the dawn, and all
The thunder of the trumpets of the noun!
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

In "A Letter to a Live Poet," Rupert Brooke employs a free verse form with irregular line lengths and a lack of strict rhyme scheme. The poem is structured as a letter addressed to a contemporary poet, expressing a longing for the return of traditional poetic elements such as meter and rhyme. Despite the lack of a consistent structure in the poem itself, Brooke's plea for the revival of classical poetic forms is evident through his use of various metrical patterns and rhyme schemes within the text. 

Brooke references traditional poetic devices such as "pentameters," "rhyme," and "polysyllables" in the poem, highlighting the absence of these elements in modern poetry. By juxtaposing the traditional with the contemporary, Brooke emphasizes his desire for a return to the classical forms of poetry that he admires.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem revolves around the contrast between traditional and modern poetry. Brooke celebrates the beauty and richness of classical poetic forms, longing for the return of meter, rhyme, and complex language in contemporary poetry. Through vivid imagery, he paints a picture of the lost artistry of poetry, using phrases like "odorous, amorous style of poetry" and "melancholy knocking of those lines" to evoke a sense of nostalgia for the past.

The imagery in the poem also conveys a sense of yearning and dissatisfaction with the current state of poetry. References to "bizarre emotions" and "infinite meaning in a little gloom" suggest a critique of modern poetry's tendency towards simplicity and lack of depth. Brooke's use of imagery effectively conveys his frustration with the perceived decline of poetic standards.

### Literary Devices

Brooke employs various literary devices throughout the poem to convey his message effectively. One notable device is alliteration, as seen in phrases like "the stress of the penultimate" and "the thrill of all the tribrachs." This use of alliteration adds a musical quality to the text and emphasizes certain key ideas.

The poem also features personification, as Brooke personifies poetic elements such as verbs, conjunctions, and epithets, giving them human-like qualities. This personification serves to highlight the importance of these elements in creating rich and meaningful poetry.

Additionally, Brooke uses metaphorical language, comparing poetry to a living entity that has been diminished in its vitality. By likening poetry to a dying muse or a buried figure like Cѕsura, he emphasizes the loss of poetic beauty and complexity in the modern age.

### Historical and Personal Context

Written during the early 20th century, Rupert Brooke's "A Letter to a Live Poet" reflects the poet's disillusionment with the contemporary literary scene. The poem captures a time when traditional poetic forms were giving way to more experimental and modernist styles of writing. Brooke's frustration with the direction of poetry in his era mirrors a broader cultural shift towards innovation and individuality in art.

As a well-known poet himself, Brooke's personal context as a literary figure adds depth to the poem's plea for a return to classical poetry. His desire to see a revival of traditional poetic forms may stem from a sense of nostalgia for a bygone era of literary excellence, as well as a concern for the future of poetry in a rapidly changing world.

### Deep Reading

In a deeper analysis, "A Letter to a Live Poet" can be seen as a passionate defense of the enduring power of classical poetic forms. Brooke's longing for the return of meter, rhyme, and complex language is not merely a call for nostalgia but a plea for a reconnection with the timeless beauty and depth of traditional poetry. Through his use of vivid imagery, literary devices, and historical context, Brooke crafts a poignant reminder of the importance of preserving the artistry and craftsmanship of poetry in an ever-evolving literary landscape.

## Lines Written In Early Spring by William Wordsworth

```
I heard a thousand blended notes,
While in a grove I sate reclined,
In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts
Bring sad thoughts to the mind.

To her fair works did Nature link
The human soul that through me ran;
And much it grieved my heart to think
What man has made of man.

Through primrose tufts, in that green bower,
The periwinkle trailed its wreaths;
And 'tis my faith that every flower
Enjoys the air it breathes.

The birds around me hopped and played,
Their thoughts I cannot measure:--
But the least motion which they made
It seemed a thrill of pleasure.

The budding twigs spread out their fan,
To catch the breezy air;
And I must think, do all I can,
That there was pleasure there.

If this belief from heaven be sent,
If such be Nature's holy plan,
Have I not reason to lament
What man has made of man?
```

This imagery serves to highlight the contrast between the purity of nature and the corruption of human society.

### Literary Devices
Wordsworth employs several literary devices in the poem to enhance its themes and imagery. One notable device is personification, where nature is described as having human-like qualities. For example, Nature is said to "link / The human soul" and the flowers are believed to "enjoy the air they breathe." This personification serves to emphasize the interconnectedness between humans and nature. Additionally, the repetition of the phrase "What man has made of man" throughout the poem acts as a refrain, underscoring the poet's lament for the state of humanity.

### Historical and Personal Context
William Wordsworth was a key figure in the Romantic literary movement, which emphasized the beauty of nature, the importance of emotion and imagination, and a rejection of industrialization and urbanization.

### Deep Reading
"Lines Written In Early Spring" can be seen as a meditation on the duality of human existence - the capacity for both destruction and harmony. The speaker's contemplation of nature's beauty and innocence serves as a stark contrast to the speaker's sorrow over the actions of humanity. The poem ultimately urges readers to reflect on their own relationship with nature and the world around them, prompting a deeper consideration of the consequences of human actions on the environment and society.
