## Fragment: 'Alas! This Is Not What I Thought Life Was' by Percy Bysshe Shelley

```
Alas! this is not what I thought life was.
I knew that there were crimes and evil men,
Misery and hate; nor did I hope to pass
Untouched by suffering, through the rugged glen.
In mine own heart I saw as in a glass
The hearts of others ... And when
I went among my kind, with triple brass
Of calm endurance my weak breast I armed,
To bear scorn, fear, and hate, a woful mass!
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

In terms of form, this poem is a fragment, indicating that it is part of a larger work that may be incomplete. The poem consists of a single stanza with 14 lines. It follows a loose iambic pentameter, with alternating lines of 10 and 11 syllables, giving it a rhythmic flow. The rhyme scheme is ABABCCDDEEFFGG, with the rhyming couplets at the end providing a sense of closure to the fragment.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem revolves around disillusionment and the harsh realities of life. The speaker expresses disappointment and surprise at the extent of evil, suffering, and hatred in the world. The imagery of a "rugged glen" symbolizes the difficult and treacherous path of life, while the metaphor of seeing "hearts of others" in his own heart reflects the speaker's empathy and understanding of human nature. The use of "triple brass" to describe the armor of endurance highlights the speaker's determination to withstand the negativity and cruelty of the world.

### Literary Devices

Shelley employs several literary devices in the poem to convey the speaker's feelings of disillusionment and resilience. The use of alliteration in "scorn, fear, and hate" emphasizes the weight of the suffering that the speaker must endure. The comparison of the speaker's heart to a mirror ("I saw as in a glass") employs simile to underscore the reflective nature of empathy. Additionally, the repetition of "Alas!" at the beginning of the poem conveys a sense of lamentation and sorrow.

### Historical and Personal Context

Written during the Romantic era, Shelley's poem reflects the disillusionment and idealism that characterized much of the Romantic movement. Shelley himself was known for his radical views and his criticism of social injustices, which likely influenced the themes of the poem. The personal context of Shelley's own experiences with suffering and persecution may have also informed the speaker's reflections on the harsh realities of life.

### Deep Reading

At a deeper level, the poem can be seen as a meditation on the nature of empathy and resilience in the face of adversity. The speaker's realization of the pervasive evil and suffering in the world leads to a sense of disillusionment, yet the decision to armor oneself with "calm endurance" suggests a resolve to confront these challenges with strength and fortitude. Through the speaker's introspection and empathy, Shelley highlights the interconnectedness of human experiences and the importance of facing life's hardships with courage and compassion.

## Merry Autumn by Paul Laurence Dunbar

```
It's all a farce,—these tales they tell
  About the breezes sighing,
And moans astir o'er field and dell,
  Because the year is dying.

Such principles are most absurd,—
  I care not who first taught 'em;
There's nothing known to beast or bird
  To make a solemn autumn.

In solemn times, when grief holds sway
  With countenance distressing,
You'll note the more of black and gray
  Will then be used in dressing.

Now purple tints are all around;
  The sky is blue and mellow;
And e'en the grasses turn the ground
  From modest green to yellow.

The seed burs all with laughter crack
  On featherweed and jimson;
And leaves that should be dressed in black
  Are all decked out in crimson.

A butterfly goes winging by;
  A singing bird comes after;
And Nature, all from earth to sky,
  Is bubbling o'er with laughter.

The ripples wimple on the rills,
  Like sparkling little lasses;
The sunlight runs along the hills,
  And laughs among the grasses.

The earth is just so full of fun
  It really can't contain it;
And streams of mirth so freely run
  The heavens seem to rain it.

Don't talk to me of solemn days
  In autumn's time of splendor,
Because the sun shows fewer rays,
  And these grow slant and slender.

Why, it's the climax of the year,—
  The highest time of living!—
Till naturally its bursting cheer
  Just melts into thanksgiving.
```

The use of quatrains allows Dunbar to present his ideas in a structured and organized manner, while the rhyme scheme adds a musical quality to the poem. The consistent meter and rhyme scheme contribute to the overall light and playful tone of the poem, mirroring the joy and liveliness of autumn that Dunbar describes.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem is the joy and vibrancy of autumn, which is contrasted with the traditional idea of autumn as a solemn and melancholic season.

The imagery used in the poem vividly depicts the beauty of autumn, with colorful descriptions of purple tints, blue skies, yellow grasses, crimson leaves, and laughing streams. The imagery of nature bursting with life and laughter conveys a sense of joy and exuberance that is characteristic of autumn in the poem.

### Literary Devices

Dunbar employs several literary devices to enhance the meaning and impact of the poem.

Additionally, Dunbar uses imagery, such as the laughter of streams and the sunlight running among the hills, to create a vivid and sensory experience for the reader. The use of these literary devices helps to convey the theme of joy and celebration in the poem.

### Historical and Personal Context

Paul Laurence Dunbar was an African American poet who wrote during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a time marked by racial segregation and discrimination in America.

## The Englishman in Italy by Robert Browning

```
Piano di Sorrento

Fortù, Fortù, my beloved one,
        Sit here by my side,
On my knees put up both little feet!
        I was sure, if I tried,
I could make you laugh spite of Scirocco.
        Now, open your eyes,
Let me keep you amused till he vanish
        In black from the skies,
With telling my memories over
        As you tell your beads;
All the Plain saw me gather, I garland
        --The flowers or the weeds.

Time for rain! for your long hot dry Autumn
        Had net-worked with brown
The white skin of each grape on the bunches,
        Marked like a quail's crown,
Those creatures you make such account of,
        Whose heads--speckled white
Over brown like a great spider's back,
        As I told you last night--
Your mother bites off for her supper.
        Red-ripe as could be,
Pomegranates were chapping and splitting
        In halves on the tree:
And betwixt the loose walls of great flintstone,
        Or in the thick dust
On the path, or straight out of the rockside,
        Wherever could thrust
Some burnt sprig of bold hardy rock-flower
        Its yellow face up,
For the prize were great butterflies fighting,
        Some five for one cup.
So, I guessed, ere I got up this morning,
        What change was in store,
By the quick rustle-down of the quail-nets
        Which woke me before
I could open my shutter, made fast
        With a bough and a stone,
And look thro' the twisted dead vine-twigs,
        Sole lattice that's known.
Quick and sharp rang the rings down the net-poles,
        While, busy beneath,
Your priest and his brother tugged at them,
        The rain in their teeth.
And out upon all the flat house-roofs
        Where split figs lay drying,
The girls took the frails under cover:
        Nor use seemed in trying
To get out the boats and go fishing,
        For, under the cliff,
Fierce the black water frothed o'er the blind-rock.
        No seeing our skiff
Arrive about noon from Amalfi,
        --Our fisher arrive,
And pitch down his basket before us,
        All trembling alive
With pink and grey jellies, your sea-fruit;
        You touch the strange lumps,
And mouths gape there, eyes open, all manner
        Of horns and of humps,
Which only the fisher looks grave at,
        While round him like imps
Cling screaming the children as naked
        And brown as his shrimps;
Himself too as bare to the middle
        --You see round his neck
The string and its brass coin suspended,
        That saves him from wreck.
But to-day not a boat reached Salerno,
        So back, to a man,
Came our friends, with whose help in the vineyards
        Grape-harvest began.
In the vat, halfway up in our houseside,
        Like blood the juice spins,
While your brother all bare-legged is dancing
        Till breathless he grins
Dead-beaten in effort on effort
        To keep the grapes under,
Since still when he seems all but master,
        In pours the fresh plunder
From girls who keep coming and going
        With basket on shoulder,
And eyes shut against the rain's driving;
        Your girls that are older,--
For under the hedges of aloe,
        And where, on its bed
Of the orchard's black mould, the love-apple
        Lies pulpy and red,
All the young ones are kneeling and filling
        Their laps with the snails
Tempted out by this first rainy weather,--
        Your best of regales,
As to-night will be proved to my sorrow,
        When, supping in state,
We shall feast our grape-gleaners (two dozen,
        Three over one plate)
With lasagne so tempting to swallow,
        In slippery ropes,
And gourds fried in great purple slices,
        That colour of popes.
Meantime, see the grape bunch they've brought you:
        The rain-water slips
O'er the heavy blue bloom on each globe
        Which the wasp to your lips
Still follows with fretful persistence:
        Nay, taste, while awake,
This half of a curd-white smooth cheese-ball
        That peels, flake by flake,
Like an onion, each smoother and whiter;
        Next, sip this weak wine
From the thin green glass flask, with its stopper,
        A leaf of the vine;
And end with the prickly-pear's red flesh
        That leaves thro' its juice
The stony black seeds on your pearl-teeth.
        Scirocco is loose!
Hark, the quick, whistling pelt of the olives
        Which, thick in one's track,
Tempt the stranger to pick up and bite them,
        Tho' not yet half black!
How the old twisted olive trunks shudder,
        The medlars let fall
Their hard fruit, and the brittle great fig-trees
        Snap off, figs and all,
For here comes the whole of the tempest!
        No refuge, but creep
Back again to my side and my shoulder,
        And listen or sleep.
O how will your country show next week,
        When all the vine-boughs
Have been stripped of their foliage to pasture
        The mules and the cows?
Last eve, I rode over the mountains,
        Your brother, my guide,
Soon left me, to feast on the myrtles
        That offered, each side,
Their fruit-balls, black, glossy and luscious,--
        Or strip from the sorbs
A treasure, or, rosy and wondrous,
        Those hairy gold orbs!
But my mule picked his sure sober path out,
        Just stopping to neigh
When he recognized down in the valley
        His mates on their way
With the faggots and barrels of water;
        And soon we emerged
From the plain, where the woods could scarce follow;
        And still as we urged
Our way, the woods wondered, and left us,
        As up still we trudged
Though the wild path grew wilder each instant,
        And place was e'en grudged
'Mid the rock-chasms and piles of loose stones
        Like the loose broken teeth
Of some monster which climbed there to die
        From the ocean beneath--
Place was grudged to the silver-grey fume-weed
        That clung to the path,
And dark rosemary ever a-dying
        That, 'spite the wind's wrath,
So loves the salt rock's face to seaward,
        And lentisks as staunch
To the stone where they root and bear berries,
        And... what shows a branch
Coral-coloured, transparent, with circlets
        Of pale seagreen leaves;
Over all trod my mule with the caution
        Of gleaners o'er sheaves,
Still, foot after foot like a lad
        Till, round after round,
He climbed to the top of Calvano,
        And God's own profound
Was above me, and round me the mountains,
        And under, the sea,
And within me my heart to bear witness
        What was and shall be.

Oh, heaven and the terrible crystal!
        No rampart excludes
Your eye from the life to be lived
        In the blue solitudes.
Oh, those mountains, their infinite movement!
        Still moving with you;
For, ever some new head and breast of them
        Thrusts into view
To observe the intruder; you see it
        If quickly you turn
And, before they escape you surprise them.
        They grudge you should learn
How the soft plains they look on, lean over
        And love (they pretend)
--Cower beneath them, the flat sea-pine crouches,
        The wild fruit-trees bend,
E'en the myrtle-leaves curl, shrink and shut:
        All is silent and grave:
'Tis a sensual and timorous beauty,
        How fair! but a slave.
So, I turned to the sea; and there slumbered
        As greenly as ever
Those isles of the siren, your Galli;
        No ages can sever
The Three, nor enable their sister
        To join them,--halfway
On the voyage, she looked at Ulysses--
        No farther to-day,
Tho' the small one, just launched in the wave,
        Watches breast-high and steady
From under the rock, her bold sister
        Swum halfway already.
Fortù, shall we sail there together
        And see from the sides
Quite new rocks show their faces, new haunts
        Where the siren abides?
Shall we sail round and round them, close over
        The rocks, tho' unseen,
That ruffle the grey glassy water
        To glorious green?
Then scramble from splinter to splinter,
        Reach land and explore,
On the largest, the strange square black turret
        With never a door,
Just a loop to admit the quick lizards;
        Then, stand there and hear
The birds' quiet singing, that tells us
        What life is, so clear?
--The secret they sang to Ulysses
        When, ages ago,
He heard and he knew this life's secret
        I hear and I know.

Ah, see! The sun breaks o'er Calvano;
        He strikes the great gloom
And flutters it o'er the mount's summit
        In airy gold fume.
All is over.  Look out, see the gipsy,
        Our tinker and smith,
Has arrived, set up bellows and forge,
        And down-squatted forthwith
To his hammering, under the wall there;
        One eye keeps aloof
The urchins that itch to be putting
        His jews'-harps to proof,
While the other, thro' locks of curled wire,
        Is watching how sleek
Shines the hog, come to share in the windfall
        --Chew, abbot's own cheek!
All is over.  Wake up and come out now,
        And down let us go,
And see the fine things got in order
        At church for the show
Of the Sacrament, set forth this evening.
        To-morrow's the Feast
Of the Rosary's Virgin, by no means
        Of Virgins the least,
As you'll hear in the off-hand discourse
        Which (all nature, no art)
The Dominican brother, these three weeks,
        Was getting by heart.
Not a pillar nor post but is dizened
        With red and blue papers;
All the roof waves with ribbons, each altar
        A-blaze with long tapers;
But the great masterpiece is the scaffold
        Rigged glorious to hold
All the fiddlers and fifers and drummers
        And trumpeters bold,
Not afraid of Bellini nor Auber,
        Who, when the priest's hoarse,
Will strike us up something that's brisk
        For the feast's second course.
And then will the flaxen-wigged Image
        Be carried in pomp
Thro' the plain, while in gallant procession
        The priests mean to stomp.
All round the glad church lie old bottles
        With gunpowder stopped,
Which will be, when the Image re-enters,
        Religiously popped;
And at night from the crest of Calvano
        Great bonfires will hang,
On the plain will the trumpets join chorus,
        And more poppers bang.
At all events, come-to the garden
        As far as the wall;
See me tap with a hoe on the plaster
        Till out there shall fall
A scorpion with wide angry nippers!

        --"Such trifles!" you say?
Fortù, in my England at home,
        Men meet gravely to-day
And debate, if abolishing Corn-laws
        Be righteous and wise
--If 'twere proper, Scirocco should vanish
        In black from the skies!
```
