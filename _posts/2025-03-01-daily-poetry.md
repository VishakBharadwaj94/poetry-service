## The Heretic's Tragedy: A Middle-Age Interlude by Robert Browning

```
The Lord, we look to once for all,
        Is the Lord we should look at, all at once:
He knows not to vary, saith Saint Paul,
        Nor the shadow of turning, for the nonce.
See him no other than as he is!
        Give both the infinitudes their due--
Infinite mercy, but, I wis,
        As infinite a justice too.

As infinite a justice too.

John, Master of the Temple of God,
        Falling to sin the Unknown Sin,
What he bought of Emperor Aldabrod,
        He sold it to Sultan Saladin:
Till, caught by Pope Clement, a-buzzing there,
        Hornet-prince of the mad wasps' hive,
And clipt of his wings in Paris square,
        They bring him now to be burned alive.
                        [And wanteth there grace of lute or
                                clavicithern, ye shall say to
                                confirm him who singeth--
        We bring John now to be burned alive.

In the midst is a goodly gallows built;
        'Twixt fork and fork, a stake is stuck;
But first they set divers tumbrils a-tilt,
        Make a trench all round with the city muck;
Inside they pile log upon log, good store;
        Faggots no few, blocks great and small,
Reach a man's mid-thigh, no less, no more,--
        For they mean he should roast in the sight of all.

        We mean he should roast in the sight of all.

Good sappy bavins that kindle forthwith;
        Billets that blaze substantial and slow;
Pine-stump split deftly, dry as pith;
        Larch-heart that chars to a chalk-white glow:
They up they hoist me John in a chafe,
        Sling him fast like a hog to scorch,
Spit in his face, then leap back safe,
Sing "Laudes" and bid clap-to the torch.

        Laus deo--who bids clap-to the torch.

John of the Temple, whose fame so bragged,
        Is burning alive in Paris square!
How can he curse, if his mouth is gagged?
        Or wriggle his neck, with a collar there?
Or heave his chest, which a band goes round?
        Or threat with his fist, since his arms are spliced?
Or kick with his feet, now his legs are bound?
        --Thinks John, I will call upon Jesus Christ.

Jesus Christ--John had bought and sold,
        Jesus Christ--John had eaten and drunk;
To him, the Flesh meant silver and gold.
        (Salva reverentia.)
Now it was, "Saviour, bountiful lamb,
        "I have roasted thee Turks, though men roast me!
"See thy servant, the plight wherein I am!
        "Art thou a saviour? Save thou me!"

       'Tis John the mocker cries, "Save thou me!"

Who maketh God's menace an idle word?
        --Saith, it no more means what it proclaims,
Than a damsel's threat to her wanton bird?
        For she too prattles of ugly names.
--Saith, he knoweth but one thing--what he knows?
        That God is good and the rest is breath;
Why else is the same styled Sharon's rose?
        Once a rose, ever a rose, he saith.

        O, John shall yet find a rose, he saith!

Alack, there be roses and roses, John!
        Some, honied of taste like your leman's  tongue:
Some, bitter; for why? (roast gaily on!)
        Their tree struck root in devil's-dung.
When Paul once reasoned of righteousness
        And of temperance and of judgment to come,
Good Felix trembled, he could no less:
        John, snickering, crook'd his wicked thumb.

        What cometh to John of the wicked thumb?

Ha ha, John plucketh now at his rose
        To rid himself of a sorrow at heart!
Lo,--petal on petal, fierce rays unclose;
        Anther on anther, sharp spikes outstart;
And with blood for dew, the bosom boils;
        And a gust of sulphur is all its smell;
And lo, he is horribly in the toils
        Of a coal-black giant flower of hell!

        What maketh heaven, That maketh hell.

So, as John called now, through the fire amain,
        On the Name, he had cursed with, all his life--
To the Person, he bought and sold again--
        For the Face, with his daily buffets rife--
Feature by feature It took its place:
        And his voice, like a mad dog's choking bark,
At the steady whole of the Judge's face--
        Died. Forth John's soul flared into the dark.

        God help all poor souls lost in the dark!

## Sonnet 19 - The soul's Rialto hath its merchandise by Elizabeth Barrett Browning

```
XIX

The soul's Rialto hath its merchandise;
I barter curl for curl upon that mart,
And from my poet's forehead to my heart
Receive this lock which outweighs argosies,â€”
As purply black, as erst to Pindar's eyes
The dim purpureal tresses gloomed athwart
The nine white Muse-brows. For this counterpart, . . .
The bay-crown's shade, Beloved, I surmise,
Still lingers on thy curl, it is so black!
Thus, with a fillet of smooth-kissing breath,
I tie the shadows safe from gliding back,
And lay the gift where nothing hindereth;
Here on my heart, as on thy brow, to lack
No natural heat till mine grows cold in death.
```

### Word Suggestions

Consider these word pairs that complement your poem's tone:

- **foe** (Germanic) / **enemy** (Latinate)
  - *While both words convey the idea of someone who is opposed or hostile, 'foe' has a more archaic and poetic feel, invoking a sense of ancient conflicts or rivalries. 'Enemy', on the other hand, is more straightforward and commonly used in everyday language.*
  - **Recommended:** Use the germanic version to enhance your poem's tone

- **fast** (Germanic) / **rapid** (Latinate)
  - *'Fast' suggests speed but also a sense of immediacy and urgency, while 'rapid' emphasizes quickness and swiftness. 'Fast' has a stronger emotional impact and can convey a sense of intensity, making it more suitable for a poem focused on power and unpredictability in nature.*
  - **Recommended:** Use the germanic version to enhance your poem's tone

- **lie** (Germanic) / **repose** (Latinate)
  - *'Lie' conveys a sense of rest or being at rest, often associated with sleep or relaxation. 'Repose' also means rest, but it carries a more formal and poetic tone, suggesting a peaceful and tranquil state. In the context of the poem's themes of natural beauty and wonder, 'repose' would enhance the emotional resonance.*
