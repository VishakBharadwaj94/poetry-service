## Roses by Joyce Kilmer

```
(For Katherine Bregy)

I went to gather roses and twine them in a ring,
For I would make a posy, a posy for the King.
I got an hundred roses, the loveliest there be,
From the white rose vine and the pink rose bush and from the red
rose tree.
But when I took my posy and laid it at His feet
I found He had His roses a million times more sweet.
There was a scarlet blossom upon each foot and hand,
And a great pink rose bloomed from His side for the healing of the
land.
Now of this fair and awful King there is this marvel told,
That He wears a crown of linked thorns instead of one of gold.
Where there are thorns are roses, and I saw a line of red,
A little wreath of roses around His radiant head.
A red rose is His Sacred Heart, a white rose is His face,
And His breath has turned the barren world to a rich and flowery
place.
He is the Rose of Sharon, His gardener am I,
And I shall drink His fragrance in Heaven when I die.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme
The poem "Roses" by Joyce Kilmer is written in a traditional rhyming scheme with a consistent meter. The poem consists of five stanzas, each with four lines. The rhyme scheme in each stanza is AABB, where the first and second lines rhyme with each other, as do the third and fourth lines. This structured form gives the poem a sense of order and harmony, mirroring the beauty and elegance of the roses the speaker describes. The meter is mainly iambic, with a regular pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables, creating a smooth and flowing rhythm throughout the poem.

### Themes and Imagery
The central theme of the poem revolves around the symbolism of roses in relation to the King, who is likely a reference to Jesus Christ. The act of gathering roses to make a posy for the King conveys sentiments of love, devotion, and reverence. The imagery of roses, particularly the colors white, pink, and red, symbolizes purity, love, and sacrifice. The description of the King having roses that surpass the beauty of the ones gathered by the speaker highlights the divine nature and perfection of the King. The imagery of thorns and roses intertwined symbolizes the concept of suffering and redemption, with the thorns representing the pain and sacrifice of Christ, while the roses symbolize beauty and salvation.

### Literary Devices
Kilmer employs various literary devices to enhance the meaning and impact of the poem. The use of metaphor is prevalent throughout the poem, with the King being compared to a rose in different forms, such as a scarlet blossom, a pink rose, and the Rose of Sharon. Symbolism is also evident, with the roses representing love, beauty, and sacrifice, while the thorns symbolize suffering and redemption. Personification is used when the speaker refers to themselves as the gardener of the King, emphasizing their role in nurturing and caring for the divine presence. The repetition of the word "roses" throughout the poem serves to reinforce the central motif and highlight its significance.

### Historical and Personal Context
Joyce Kilmer, a devout Catholic poet, wrote this poem with a deep sense of religious devotion and reverence for Christ. The references to the King wearing a crown of thorns and the imagery of His Sacred Heart and radiant head are rooted in Christian iconography and symbolism.

The juxtaposition of the speaker's humble offering of roses with the King's divine and transcendent beauty highlights the ineffable nature of Christ's sacrifice and the overwhelming grace of His presence. The imagery of roses blooming from wounds and thorns transforming into beauty underscores the transformative power of Christ's love and sacrifice in the world. The poem ultimately conveys a sense of awe, wonder, and gratitude towards the divine presence of Christ, emphasizing the eternal fragrance of His love that transcends earthly limitations.

## Abt Vogler: After he has been extemporizing upon the musical instrument of his invention by Robert Browning

```
Would that the structure brave, the manifold music I build,
  Bidding my organ obey, calling its keys to their work,
Claiming each slave of the sound, at a touch, as when Solomon willed
  Armies of angels that soar, legions of demons that lurk,
Man, brute, reptile, fly,--alien of end and of aim,
  Adverse, each from the other heaven-high, hell-deep removed,--
Should rush into sight at once as he named the ineffable Name,
  And pile him a palace straight, to pleasure the princess he loved!

Would it might tarry like his, the beautiful building of mine,
  This which my keys in a crowd pressed and importuned to raise!
Ah, one and all, how they helped, would dispart now and now combine,
  Zealous to hasten the work, heighten their master his praise!
And one would bury his brow with a blind plunge down to hell,
  Burrow awhile and build, broad on the roots of things,
Then up again swim into sight, having based me my palace well,
  Founded it, fearless of flame, flat on the nether springs.

And another would mount and march, like the excellent minion he was,
  Ay, another and yet another, one crowd but with many a crest,
Raising my rampired walls of gold as transparent as glass,
  Eager to do and die, yield each his place to the rest:
For higher still and higher (as a runner tips with fire,
  When a great illumination surprises a festal night--
Outlining round and round Rome's dome from space to spire)
  Up, the pinnacled glory reached, and the pride of my soul was in sight.

In sight? Not half! for it seemed, it was certain, to match man's birth,
  Nature in turn conceived, obeying an impulse as I;
And the emulous heaven yearned down, made effort to reach the earth.
  As the earth had done her best, in my passion, to scale the sky:
Novel splendours burst forth, grew familiar and dwelt with mine.
  Not a point nor peak but found and fixed its wandering star;
Meteor-moons, balls of blaze: and they did not pale nor pine,
  For earth had attained to heaven, there was no more near nor far.

Nay more; for there wanted not who walked, in the glare and glow,
  Presences plain in the place; or, fresh, from the Protoplast,
Furnished for ages to come, when a kindlier wind should blow,
  Lured now to begin and live, in a house to their liking at last:
Or else the wonderful Dead who have passed thro' the body and gone,
  But were back once more to breathe in an old world worth their new:
What never had been, was now; what was, as it shall be anon;
  And what is,--shall I say, matched both? for I was made perfect too.

All thro' my keys that gave their sounds to a wish of my soul,
  All thro' my soul that praised as its wish flowed visibly forth,
All thro' music and me! For think, had I painted the whole,
  Why, there it had stood, to see, nor the process so wonder-worth:
Had I written the same, made verse--still, effect proceeds from cause,
  Ye know why the forms are fair, ye hear how the tale is told;
It is all triumphant art, but art in obedience to laws,
  Painter and poet are proud, in the artist-list enrolled:--

But here is the finger of God, a flash of the will that can,
  Existent behind all laws, that made them, and, lo, they are!
And I know not if, save in this, such gift be allowed to man,
  That out of three sounds he frame, not a fourth sound, but a star.
Consider it well: each tone of our scale in itself is naught;
  It is everywhere in the world--loud, soft, and all is said:
Give it to me to use! I mix it with two in my thought,
  And, there! Ye have heard and seen; consider and bow the head!

Well, it is gone at last, the palace of music I reared;
  Gone! and the good tears start, the praises that come too slow;
For one is assured at first, one scarce can say that he feared,
  That he even gave it a thought, the gone thing was to go.
Never to be again! But many more of the kind
  As good, nay, better perchance: is this your comfort to me?
To me, who must be saved because I cling with my mind
  To the same, same self, same love, same God: ay, what was, shall be.

Therefore to whom turn I but to Thee, the ineffable Name?
  Builder and maker, Thou, of houses not made with hands!
What, have fear of change from Thee who art ever the same?
  Doubt that Thy power can fill the heart that Thy power expands?
There shall never be one lost good! What was, shall live as before;
  The evil is null, is naught, is silence implying sound;
What was good, shall be good, with, for evil, so much good more;
  On the earth the broken arcs; in the heaven, a perfect round.

All we have willed or hoped or dreamed of good shall exist;
  Not its semblance, but itself; no beauty, nor good, nor power
Whose voice has gone forth, but each survives for the melodist,
  When eternity affirms the conception of an hour.
The high that proved too high, the heroic for earth too hard.
  The passion that left the ground to lose itself in the sky,
Are music sent up to God by the lover and the bard;
  Enough that he heard it once; we shall hear it by and by.

And what is our failure here but a triumph's evidence
  For the fulness of the days? Have we withered or agonized?
Why else was the pause prolonged but that singing might issue thence?
  Why rushed the discords in but that harmony should be prized?
Sorrow is hard to bear, and doubt is slow to clear,
  Each sufferer says his say, his scheme of the weal and woe:
But God has a few of us whom He whispers in the ear;
  The rest may reason and welcome; 'tis we musicians know.

Well, it is earth with me; silence resumes her reign:
  I will be patient and proud, and soberly acquiesce.
Give me the keys. I feel for the common chord again,
  Sliding by semitones, till I sink to the minor,--yes,
And I blunt it into a ninth, and I stand on alien ground,
  Surveying awhile the heights I rolled from into the deep:
Which, hark, I have dared and done, for my resting-place is found,
  The C Major of this life: so, now I will try to sleep.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

Robert Browning's poem "Abt Vogler" is written in blank verse, which is unrhymed iambic pentameter. The lack of rhyme scheme allows the poem to flow freely and naturally, mirroring the improvisational nature of music.

The meter is predominantly iambic, with lines such as "Would it might tarry like his, the beautiful building of mine," exemplifying this rhythmic pattern.

### Themes and Imagery

The central themes of the poem revolve around the power of music, creativity, and the relationship between art and divinity.

The poem also features metaphor, such as comparing music to a palace or a runner "tips with fire." Browning's use of personification, particularly in the lines "All thro' my keys that gave their sounds to a wish of my soul," gives agency to the musical instruments, emphasizing the symbiotic relationship between the speaker and his art.

### Historical and Personal Context

Written during the Victorian era, Browning's "Abt Vogler" reflects the Romantic ideals of individual creativity and the transcendental power of art. The poem can also be seen as a reflection of Browning's own beliefs about the role of the artist in society and the spiritual significance of artistic creation.

The speaker's musings on music as a means of connecting with the divine, as well as the idea of creating something beautiful and enduring through artistic expression, resonate deeply with the Romantic notion of the artist as a visionary figure. The poem also delves into the themes of impermanence and the cyclical nature of creation and destruction, as seen in the speaker's acceptance of the transient nature of his musical creation. Ultimately, "Abt Vogler" celebrates the enduring legacy of art and the artist's quest for perfection and transcendence in the face of impermanence and change.

## When I was small, a Woman died -- by Emily Dickinson

```
When I was small, a Woman died --
Today -- her Only Boy
Went up from the Potomac --
His face all Victory

To look at her -- How slowly
The Seasons must have turned
Till Bullets clipt an Angle
And He passed quickly round --

If pride shall be in Paradise --
Ourself cannot decide --
Of their imperial Conduct --
No person testified --

But, proud in Apparition --
That Woman and her Boy
Pass back and forth, before my Brain
As even in the sky --

I'm confident that Bravoes --
Perpetual break abroad
For Braveries, remote as this
In Scarlet Maryland --
```
