## We thirst at first -- 'tis Nature's Act -- by Emily Dickinson

```
We thirst at first -- 'tis Nature's Act --
And later -- when we die --
A little Water supplicate --
Of fingers going by --

It intimates the finer want --
Whose adequate supply
Is that Great Water in the West --
Termed Immortality --

## A Dirge by Percy Bysshe Shelley

```
Rough wind, that moanest loud
Grief too sad for song;
Wild wind, when sullen cloud
Knells all the night long;
Sad storm whose tears are vain,
Bare woods, whose branches strain,
Deep caves and dreary main,--
Wail, for the world's wrong!
```

## My Little March Girl by Paul Laurence Dunbar

```
Come to the pane, draw the curtain apart,
There she is passing, the girl of my heart;
See where she walks like a queen in the street,
Weather-defying, calm, placid and sweet.
Tripping along with impetuous grace,
Joy of her life beaming out of her face,
Tresses all truant-like, curl upon curl,
Wind-blown and rosy, my little March girl.

Hint of the violet's delicate bloom,
Hint of the rose's pervading perfume!
How can the wind help from kissing her face,—
Wrapping her round in his stormy embrace?
But still serenely she laughs at his rout,
She is the victor who wins in the bout.
So may life's passions about her soul swirl,
Leaving it placid,—my little March girl.

What self-possession looks out of her eyes!
What are the wild winds, and what are the skies,
Frowning and glooming when, brimming with life,
Cometh the little maid ripe for the strife?
Ah! Wind, and bah! Wind, what might have you now?
What can you do with that innocent brow?
Blow, Wind, and grow, Wind, and eddy and swirl,
But bring to me, Wind,—my little March girl.
```

**Form:** Pantoum

**Structure:** The Pantoum consists of quatrains where lines are repeated in a specific pattern to create a looping effect.

**Rhyme Scheme:** ABAB

*Prompt: Write a poem about the changing seasons and how they evoke memories of the past, weaving in sensory details like the smell of fresh rain or the feel of crisp autumn leaves.*

### Word Suggestions

Consider these word pairs that complement your poem's tone:

- **belive** (Germanic) / **remain** (Latinate)
  - *The word 'belive' has a more archaic and poetic feel, suggesting a deeper sense of faith or trust. In contrast, 'remain' is more straightforward and concrete, indicating something staying in a particular place or state. For a tone of nostalgia and reflection in a Pantoum poem, 'belive' would add a touch of old-world charm and mystery, enhancing the emotional resonance.*
  - **Recommended:** Use the germanic version to enhance your poem's tone

- **blee** (Germanic) / **colour** (Latinate)
  - *'Blee' is a poetic and less common term for color, often associated with older English dialects. On the other hand, 'colour' is the standard modern term that is more precise and widely understood. Considering the theme of memories and sensory details in the poem, 'blee' would evoke a sense of tradition and folklore, making it a better choice to enhance the emotional impact and thematic goals.*
  - **Recommended:** Use the germanic version to enhance your poem's tone

- **hill** (Germanic) / **mount** (Latinate)
  - *While both 'hill' and 'mount' refer to elevated landforms, 'hill' conveys a sense of familiarity and closeness, often associated with everyday landscapes. On the other hand, 'mount' is more grandiose and formal, suggesting a larger or more significant mountain. In a poem focused on the changing seasons and memories of the past, 'hill' would create a more intimate and nostalgic atmosphere, aligning better with the tone and emotional resonance.*
