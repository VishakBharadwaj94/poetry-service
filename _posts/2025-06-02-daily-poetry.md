## Further in Summer than the Birds by Emily Dickinson

```
Further in Summer than the Birds
Pathetic from the Grass
A minor Nation celebrates
Its unobtrusive Mass.

No Ordinance be seen
So gradual the Grace
A pensive Custom it becomes
Enlarging Loneliness.

Antiquest felt at Noon
When August burning low
Arise this spectral Canticle
Repose to typify

Remit as yet no Grace
No Furrow on the Glow
Yet a Druidic Difference
Enhances Nature now
```

## Fragments Written for Hellas by Percy Bysshe Shelley

```
Fairest of the Destinies,
Disarray thy dazzling eyes:
Keener far thy lightnings are
Than the winged  thou bearest,
And the smile thou wearest
Wraps thee as a star
Is wrapped in light.

Could Arethuse to her forsaken urn
From Alpheus and the bitter Doris run,
Or could the morning shafts of purest light
Again into the quivers of the Sun
Be gathered--could one thought from its wild flight
Return into the temple of the brain
Without a change, without a stain,--
Could aught that is, ever again
Be what it once has ceased to be,
Greece might again be free!

A star has fallen upon the earth
Mid the benighted nations,
A quenchless atom of immortal light,
A living spark of Night,
A cresset shaken from the constellations.
Swifter than the thunder fell
To the heart of Earth, the well
Where its pulses flow and beat,
And unextinct in that cold source
Burns, and on ... course
Guides the sphere which is its prison,
Like an angelic spirit pent
In a form of mortal birth,
Till, as a spirit half-arisen
Shatters its charnel, it has rent,
In the rapture of its mirth,
The thin and painted garment of the Earth,
Ruining its chaos--a fierce breath
Consuming all its forms of living death.
```

The poem "Fragments Written for Hellas" by Percy Bysshe Shelley is structured as a series of fragmented thoughts and images, reflecting the title itself. The poem does not adhere to a strict rhyme scheme or meter, which adds to the fragmented and disjointed feel of the piece. The lack of a consistent structure mirrors the chaotic and turbulent themes present in the poem.

### Themes and Imagery

One of the central themes of the poem is the idea of freedom, particularly in the context of Greece. Shelley uses vivid imagery throughout the poem to convey the idea of a fallen star representing a quenchless atom of immortal light, symbolizing the hope and resilience of the Greek people in the face of oppression. The imagery of a star falling to Earth and guiding the sphere in its prison serves as a metaphor for the power of the human spirit to overcome adversity.

### Literary Devices

Shelley employs several literary devices in the poem to enhance its themes and imagery. The use of personification is evident in lines like "Fairest of the Destinies" and "A star has fallen upon the earth," giving human qualities to abstract concepts like destiny and stars. Additionally, the metaphor of a star as a symbol of hope and light is a powerful literary device that reinforces the theme of freedom and resilience.

### Historical and Personal Context

Written during a time of political and social upheaval in Europe, Shelley's poem can be seen as a reflection of his own revolutionary ideals and support for the Greek War of Independence. The references to Greece and the yearning for freedom can be interpreted as a call to action for individuals to rise up against oppression and fight for their rights. Shelley's personal experiences as a political activist and poet likely influenced the passionate and revolutionary tone of the poem.

### Deep Reading

By invoking powerful imagery and themes of freedom and resilience, Shelley challenges readers to consider their own roles in shaping the course of history and fighting for a better world. The poem serves as a reminder of the enduring power of hope and the human spirit in the face of adversity.

## Lines Written In Early Spring by William Wordsworth

```
I heard a thousand blended notes,
While in a grove I sate reclined,
In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts
Bring sad thoughts to the mind.

To her fair works did Nature link
The human soul that through me ran;
And much it grieved my heart to think
What man has made of man.

Through primrose tufts, in that green bower,
The periwinkle trailed its wreaths;
And 'tis my faith that every flower
Enjoys the air it breathes.

The birds around me hopped and played,
Their thoughts I cannot measure:--
But the least motion which they made
It seemed a thrill of pleasure.

The budding twigs spread out their fan,
To catch the breezy air;
And I must think, do all I can,
That there was pleasure there.

If this belief from heaven be sent,
If such be Nature's holy plan,
Have I not reason to lament
What man has made of man?
```

The juxtaposition of natural beauty and human destruction highlights the theme of man's disconnect from the natural world.

### Literary Devices

Wordsworth employs several literary devices in the poem to enhance its themes and imagery. One notable device is personification, where he ascribes human qualities to nature.
