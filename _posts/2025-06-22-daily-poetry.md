## How far is it to Heaven? by Emily Dickinson

```
How far is it to Heaven?
As far as Death this way --
Of River or of Ridge beyond
Was no discovery.

How far is it to Hell?
As far as Death this way --
How far left hand the Sepulchre
Defies Topography.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

This poem by Emily Dickinson consists of two stanzas, each with four lines. The poem follows a consistent rhyme scheme of ABCB, with the second and fourth lines of each stanza rhyming. The meter is irregular, which is typical of Dickinson's style, making use of dashes and pauses to create a unique rhythm. The poem is concise and to the point, with each stanza posing a question about the distance to Heaven and Hell.

### Themes and Imagery

The central themes of the poem revolve around the concepts of Heaven, Hell, and Death. Dickinson uses the imagery of distance and geography to explore these metaphysical ideas. By asking "How far is it to Heaven?" and "How far is it to Hell?" she challenges the reader to consider the unknowable nature of the afterlife. The mention of Death as the measure of distance to these realms adds a sense of finality and inevitability to the exploration of the unknown.

### Literary Devices

Dickinson employs several literary devices to convey her message effectively. The use of dashes in the poem creates pauses that emphasize the uncertainties surrounding the questions posed. The repetition of the phrase "As far as Death this way" in both stanzas highlights the idea that death is the ultimate boundary between the earthly realm and the afterlife. The personification of Death as a guide or marker of distance adds a haunting quality to the poem.

### Historical and Personal Context

Emily Dickinson lived a reclusive life and often explored themes of death, spirituality, and the afterlife in her poetry. Her personal experiences with loss and mortality likely influenced her interest in these topics. During Dickinson's time, discussions about Heaven and Hell were prominent in religious and philosophical discourse, and her exploration of these themes reflects the cultural and intellectual context of the mid-19th century.

### Deep Reading

On a deeper level, "How far is it to Heaven?" can be seen as a meditation on the mysteries of existence and the human quest for understanding beyond the physical world. Dickinson's use of simple language and direct questions forces the reader to confront the limitations of human knowledge when it comes to matters of the divine. The poem ultimately suggests that the distance to Heaven or Hell cannot be measured in earthly terms but is instead a metaphysical journey that transcends physical boundaries. Dickinson's contemplation of these profound questions invites readers to reflect on their own beliefs and perceptions of the afterlife.

## Aspens by Edward Thomas

```
ALL day and night, save winter, every weather,
Above the inn, the smithy, and the shop,
The aspens at the cross-roads talk together
Of rain, until their last leaves fall from the top.

Out of the blacksmith's cavern comes the ringing
Of hammer, shoe, and anvil; out of the inn
The clink, the hum, the roar, the random singing--
The sounds that for these fifty years have been.

The whisper of the aspens is not drowned,
And over lightless pane and footless road,
Empty as sky, with every other sound
Not ceasing, calls their ghosts from their abode,

A silent smithy, a silent inn, nor fails
In the bare moonlight or the thick-furred gloom,
In tempest or the night of nightingales,
To turn the cross-roads to a ghostly room.

And it would be the same were no house near.
Over all sorts of weather, men, and times,
Aspens must shake their leaves and men may hear
But need not listen, more than to my rhymes.

Whatever wind blows, while they and I have leaves
We cannot other than an aspen be
That ceaselessly, unreasonably grieves,
Or so men think who like a different tree.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "Aspens" by Edward Thomas is written in free verse, lacking a consistent rhyme scheme and meter. The lack of rhyme and meter in this poem contributes to its conversational and naturalistic tone, allowing the imagery and themes to take center stage without the constraints of a formal structure. The poem consists of four quatrains, each with varying line lengths, which creates a sense of movement and fluidity, mirroring the natural world depicted in the poem.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem revolves around the enduring presence and resilience of nature in the face of human transience. The imagery of the aspens serves as a metaphor for the passage of time and the cyclical nature of life. The aspens, with their whispering leaves and ghostly presence, symbolize the continuity of nature's voice, contrasting with the impermanence of human existence represented by the silent smithy and inn.

The cross-roads mentioned in the poem symbolize the intersection of past and present, where the echoes of history linger in the aspens' whispers. The imagery of the aspens talking about rain and their last leaves falling signifies the cyclical nature of life and the inevitability of change and decay.

### Literary Devices

Thomas employs various literary devices to enhance the poem's themes and imagery. The repetition of sounds in the first stanza ("The clink, the hum, the roar, the random singing") creates a sense of bustling activity and human presence, contrasting with the stillness of the aspens. The assonance in "smithy" and "inn" emphasizes the connection between human industry and nature.

The personification of the aspens, ascribing them with the ability to talk and whisper, imbues them with a sense of agency and consciousness, highlighting their significance in the landscape. The juxtaposition of the lively sounds of human activity with the silent presence of the aspens underscores the contrast between temporary human endeavors and the enduring nature of the natural world.

### Historical and Personal Context

Edward Thomas was a poet deeply connected to nature, and his work often reflects his profound respect for the natural world. "Aspens" was written during a time of great change and upheaval in Europe, with World War I looming on the horizon. The poem can be seen as a meditation on the timeless quality of nature in the face of human conflict and impermanence.

Thomas's personal struggles with depression and his search for meaning and solace in nature also inform the themes of the poem. The aspens, with their constant rustling and grieving, may symbolize Thomas's own sense of melancholy and longing for a deeper connection to the natural world.

### Deep Reading

At its core, "Aspens" speaks to the universal human experience of grappling with mortality and the passage of time. The aspens, with their unceasing rustling and grieving, serve as a poignant reminder of the enduring presence of nature and the inevitability of change and decay. The poem invites readers to contemplate their own place in the grand scheme of existence and to find solace in the constancy of the natural world.

Through its evocative imagery and meditative tone, "Aspens" encourages us to pause and reflect on the fleeting nature of human life and the enduring beauty of the world around us. In a time of upheaval and uncertainty, the poem offers a sense of grounding and connection to the eternal rhythms of nature, reminding us of the power and resilience of the natural world in the face of human turmoil.

## Strayed Reveller, The by Matthew Arnold

```
The Youth

Faster, faster,
O Circe, Goddess,
Let the wild, thronging train
The bright procession
Of eddying forms,
Sweep through my soul!
Thou standest, smiling
Down on me! thy right arm,
Lean'd up against the column there,
Props thy soft cheek;
Thy left holds, hanging loosely,
The deep cup, ivy-cinctured,
I held but now.
Is it, then, evening
So soon? I see, the night-dews,
Cluster'd in thick beads, dim
The agate brooch-stones
On thy white shoulder;
The cool night-wind, too,
Blows through the portico,
Stirs thy hair, Goddess,
Waves thy white robe!


Circe.

Whence art thou, sleeper?


The Youth.

When the white dawn first
Through the rough fir-planks
Of my hut, by the chestnuts,
Up at the valley-head,
Came breaking, Goddess!
I sprang up, I threw round me
My dappled fawn-skin;
Passing out, from the wet turf,
Where they lay, by the hut door,
I snatch'd up my vine-crown, my fir-staff,
All drench'd in dew-
Came swift down to join
The rout early gather'd
In the town, round the temple,
Iacchus' white fane
On yonder hill.
Quick I pass'd, following
The wood-cutters' cart-track
Down the dark valley;-I saw
On my left, through the beeches,
Thy palace, Goddess,
Smokeless, empty!
Trembling, I enter'd; beheld
The court all silent,
The lions sleeping,
On the altar this bowl.
I drank, Goddess!
And sank down here, sleeping,
On the steps of thy portico.


Circe.

Foolish boy! Why tremblest thou?
Thou lovest it, then, my wine?
Wouldst more of it? See, how glows,
Through the delicate, flush'd marble,
The red, creaming liquor,
Strown with dark seeds!
Drink, thee! I chide thee not,
Deny thee not my bowl.
Come, stretch forth thy hand, thee-so!
Drink-drink again!


The Youth.

Thanks, gracious one!
Ah, the sweet fumes again!
More soft, ah me,
More subtle-winding
Than Pan's flute-music!
Faint-faint! Ah me,
Again the sweet sleep!


Circe.

Hist! Thou-within there!
Come forth, Ulysses!
Art tired with hunting?
While we range the woodland,
See what the day brings.


Ulysses.

Ever new magic!
Hast thou then lured hither,
Wonderful Goddess, by thy art,
The young, languid-eyed Ampelus,
Iacchus' darling-
Or some youth beloved of Pan,
Of Pan and the Nymphs?
That he sits, bending downward
His white, delicate neck
To the ivy-wreathed marge
Of thy cup; the bright, glancing vine-leaves
That crown his hair,
Falling forward, mingling
With the dark ivy-plants--
His fawn-skin, half untied,
Smear'd with red wine-stains? Who is he,
That he sits, overweigh'd
By fumes of wine and sleep,
So late, in thy portico?
What youth, Goddess,-what guest
Of Gods or mortals?


Circe.

Hist! he wakes!
I lured him not hither, Ulysses.
Nay, ask him!


The Youth.

Who speaks' Ah, who comes forth
To thy side, Goddess, from within?
How shall I name him?
This spare, dark-featured,
Quick-eyed stranger?
Ah, and I see too
His sailor's bonnet,
His short coat, travel-tarnish'd,
With one arm bare!--
Art thou not he, whom fame
This long time rumours
The favour'd guest of Circe, brought by the waves?
Art thou he, stranger?
The wise Ulysses,
Laertes' son?


Ulysses.

I am Ulysses.
And thou, too, sleeper?
Thy voice is sweet.
It may be thou hast follow'd
Through the islands some divine bard,
By age taught many things,
Age and the Muses;
And heard him delighting
The chiefs and people
In the banquet, and learn'd his songs.
Of Gods and Heroes,
Of war and arts,
And peopled cities,
Inland, or built
By the gray sea.-If so, then hail!
I honour and welcome thee.


The Youth.

The Gods are happy.
They turn on all sides
Their shining eyes,
And see below them
The earth and men.
They see Tiresias
Sitting, staff in hand,
On the warm, grassy
Asopus bank,
His robe drawn over
His old sightless head,
Revolving inly
The doom of Thebes.
They see the Centaurs
In the upper glens
Of Pelion, in the streams,
Where red-berried ashes fringe
The clear-brown shallow pools,
With streaming flanks, and heads
Rear'd proudly, snuffing
The mountain wind.
They see the Indian
Drifting, knife in hand,
His frail boat moor'd to
A floating isle thick-matted
With large-leaved, low-creeping melon-plants
And the dark cucumber.
He reaps, and stows them,
Drifting--drifting;--round him,
Round his green harvest-plot,
Flow the cool lake-waves,
The mountains ring them.
They see the Scythian
On the wide stepp, unharnessing
His wheel'd house at noon.
He tethers his beast down, and makes his meal--
Mares' milk, and bread
Baked on the embers;--all around
The boundless, waving grass-plains stretch, thick-starr'd
With saffron and the yellow hollyhock
And flag-leaved iris-flowers.
Sitting in his cart
He makes his meal; before him, for long miles,
Alive with bright green lizards,
And the springing bustard-fowl,
The track, a straight black line,
Furrows the rich soil; here and there
Cluster of lonely mounds
Topp'd with rough-hewn,
Gray, rain-blear'd statues, overpeer
The sunny waste.
They see the ferry
On the broad, clay-laden
Lone Chorasmian stream;--thereon,
With snort and strain,
Two horses, strongly swimming, tow
The ferry-boat, with woven ropes
To either bow
Firm harness'd by the mane; a chief
With shout and shaken spear,
Stands at the prow, and guides them; but astern
The cowering merchants, in long robes,
Sit pale beside their wealth
Of silk-bales and of balsam-drops,
Of gold and ivory,
Of turquoise-earth and amethyst,
Jasper and chalcedony,
And milk-barred onyx-stones.
The loaded boat swings groaning
In the yellow eddies;
The Gods behold him.
They see the Heroes
Sitting in the dark ship
On the foamless, long-heaving
Violet sea.
At sunset nearing
The Happy Islands.
These things, Ulysses,
The wise bards, also
Behold and sing.
But oh, what labour!
O prince, what pain!
They too can see
Tiresias;--but the Gods,
Who give them vision,
Added this law:
That they should bear too
His groping blindness,
His dark foreboding,
His scorn'd white hairs;
Bear Hera's anger
Through a life lengthen'd
To seven ages.
They see the Centaurs
On Pelion:--then they feel,
They too, the maddening wine
Swell their large veins to bursting; in wild pain
They feel the biting spears
Of the grim Lapithж, and Theseus, drive,
Drive crashing through their bones; they feel
High on a jutting rock in the red stream
Alcmena's dreadful son
Ply his bow;--such a price
The Gods exact for song:
To become what we sing.
They see the Indian
On his mountain lake; but squalls
Make their skiff reel, and worms
In the unkind spring have gnawn
Their melon-harvest to the heart.--They see
The Scythian: but long frosts
Parch them in winter-time on the bare stepp,
Till they too fade like grass; they crawl
Like shadows forth in spring.
They see the merchants
On the Oxus stream;--but care
Must visit first them too, and make them pale.
Whether, through whirling sand,
A cloud of desert robber-horse have burst
Upon their caravan; or greedy kings,
In the wall'd cities the way passes through,
Crush'd them with tolls; or fever-airs,
On some great river's marge,
Mown them down, far from home.
They see the Heroes
Near harbour;--but they share
Their lives, and former violent toil in Thebes,
Seven-gated Thebes, or Troy;
Or where the echoing oars
Of Argo first
Startled the unknown sea.
The old Silenus
Came, lolling in the sunshine,
From the dewy forest-coverts,
This way at noon.
Sitting by me, while his Fauns
Down at the water-side
Sprinkled and smoothed
His drooping garland,
He told me these things.
But I, Ulysses,
Sitting on the warm steps,
Looking over the valley,
All day long, have seen,
Without pain, without labour,
Sometimes a wild-hair'd Mжnad--
Sometimes a Faun with torches--
And sometimes, for a moment,
Passing through the dark stems
Flowing-robed, the beloved,
The desired, the divine,
Beloved Iacchus.
Ah, cool night-wind, tremulous stars!
Ah, glimmering water,
Fitful earth-murmur,
Dreaming woods!
Ah, golden-haired, strangely smiling Goddess,
And thou, proved, much enduring,
Wave-toss'd Wanderer!
Who can stand still?
Ye fade, ye swim, ye waver before me--
The cup again!
Faster, faster,
O Circe, Goddess.
Let the wild, thronging train,
The bright procession
Of eddying forms,
Sweep through my soul!

This dialogue format adds a dynamic element to the poem and helps to explore different perspectives and themes.
