## The Notice that is called the Spring by Emily Dickinson

```
The Notice that is called the Spring
Is but a month from here --
Put up my Heart thy Hoary work
And take a Rosy Chair.

Not any House the Flowers keep --
The Birds enamor Care --
Our salary the longest Day
Is nothing but a Bier.
```

### Literary Devices

Dickinson employs several literary devices in this poem. The title itself, "The Notice that is called the Spring," personifies spring as if it were a messenger bringing tidings of the season. The use of personification continues throughout the poem with phrases like "Put up my Heart thy Hoary work" and "take a Rosy Chair," giving human qualities to abstract concepts like seasons and emotions. Additionally, the metaphor of the longest day being "nothing but a Bier" suggests that even the longest days eventually come to an end, tying back to the theme of renewal and change.

## Winter Song by Wilfred Owen

```
The browns, the olives, and the yellows died,
And were swept up to heaven; where they glowed
Each dawn and set of sun till Christmastide,
And when the land lay pale for them, pale-snowed,
Fell back, and down the snow-drifts flamed and flowed.

From off your face, into the winds of winter,
The sun-brown and the summer-gold are blowing;
But they shall gleam with spiritual glinter,
When paler beauty on your brows falls snowing,
And through those snows my looks shall be soft-going.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "Winter Song" by Wilfred Owen consists of three quatrains with a rhyme scheme of ABAB CDCD EFEF. Each stanza follows this pattern, giving the poem a structured and organized feel. The regular rhyme scheme helps to create a sense of harmony and unity within the poem. 

In terms of meter, the poem does not strictly adhere to a specific metrical pattern. However, there is a rhythmic quality to the lines, with a mix of iambic and trochaic feet. This variation in meter adds to the musicality of the poem and contributes to its overall flow.

The structure of the poem reflects the changing seasons from autumn to winter. The first stanza describes the colors of autumn fading away, the second stanza shifts to the winds of winter blowing, and the final stanza speaks of the transformation of beauty in winter. This progression mirrors the natural cycle of the seasons and adds depth to the poem's thematic content.

### Themes and Imagery

One of the central themes of the poem is the passage of time and the cyclical nature of life. The changing seasons symbolize the inevitability of change and the transient nature of beauty. The imagery of the browns, olives, and yellows dying and being swept up to heaven evokes a sense of loss and transformation.

The contrast between the warmth of summer and the cold of winter is also prominent in the poem. The sun-brown and summer-gold represent vitality and life, while the snow symbolizes death and stillness. This juxtaposition of images underscores the theme of impermanence and the eventual decay of all things.

The use of sensory imagery, such as the colors of autumn and the feel of the winter winds, creates a vivid picture in the reader's mind. The imagery of snow-drifts flaming and flowing adds a dynamic and almost paradoxical quality to the description of winter, emphasizing the beauty and power of the natural world.

### Literary Devices

Owen employs several literary devices to enhance the poem's meaning and impact. One notable device is personification, as the colors of autumn are described as dying and being swept up to heaven. This personification imbues the natural elements with human-like qualities, emphasizing their significance in the cycle of life.

Another literary device used in the poem is imagery, particularly visual and tactile imagery. The vivid descriptions of colors, landscapes, and sensations help to create a rich and immersive experience for the reader. The use of simile is also present in the comparison of paler beauty falling like snow on the speaker's beloved.

The repetition of the word "pale" throughout the poem serves to emphasize the theme of fading beauty and the onset of winter. This repetition reinforces the sense of loss and melancholy that pervades the poem, adding a layer of emotional depth to the imagery.

### Historical and Personal Context

Wilfred Owen was a renowned poet of World War I, known for his poignant and realistic depictions of war and its effects on humanity. While "Winter Song" does not directly address war, it reflects Owen's broader themes of loss, change, and the fragility of life. The poem can be seen as a meditation on the transient nature of beauty and the inevitable march of time, concepts that would have resonated with Owen's experiences during the war.

The imagery of winter and the changing seasons may also be interpreted as a metaphor for the emotional and psychological turmoil that Owen and his contemporaries experienced during the war. The contrast between the vibrant colors of autumn and the stark whiteness of winter can be seen as a reflection of the contrast between life and death, hope and despair.

### Deep Reading

On a deeper level, "Winter Song" can be viewed as a reflection on the dualities of existence - life and death, beauty and decay, warmth and cold. The poem explores the tension between these opposing forces and suggests that they are interconnected and inseparable. The speaker's contemplation of the changing seasons and the transformation of beauty in winter speaks to a deeper understanding of the cycles of nature and the human experience.

The final lines of the poem, "And through those snows my looks shall be soft-going," suggest a sense of acceptance and resignation to the passage of time and the inevitability of change. The speaker acknowledges the fleeting nature of beauty and the eventual fade of all things, yet finds solace in the softness and gentleness that can be found in the midst of winter's harshness.

Overall, "Winter Song" is a reflective and contemplative poem that delves into themes of transience, beauty, and the complexities of human emotion. Through its evocative imagery and lyrical language, the poem invites readers to ponder the mysteries of life and the enduring power of nature's cycles.

## A Better Ressurection by Christina Rossetti

```
I have no wit, no words, no tears;
My heart within me like a stone
Is numbed too much for hopes or fears.
Look right, look left, I dwell alone;
I lift mine eyes, but dimmed with grief
No everlasting hills I see;
My life is in the falling leaf:
O Jesus, quicken me.

My life is like a faded leaf,
My harvest dwindled to a husk:
Truly my life is void and brief
And tedious in the barren dusk;
My life is like a frozen thing,
No bud nor greenness can I see:
Yet rise it shall--the sap of spring;
O Jesus, rise in me.

My life is like a broken bowl,
A broken bowl that cannot hold
One drop of water for my soul
Or cordial in the searching cold;
Cast in the fire the perished thing;
Melt and remould it, till it be
A royal cup for Him, my King:
O Jesus, drink of me.
```
