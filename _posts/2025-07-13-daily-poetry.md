## The New House by Edward Thomas

```
Now first, as I shut the door,
  I was alone
In the new house; and the wind
  Began to moan.

Old at once was the house,
  And I was old;
My ears were teased with the dread
  Of what was foretold,

Nights of storm, days of mist, without end;
  Sad days when the sun
Shone in vain: old griefs and griefs
  Not yet begun.

All was foretold me; naught
  Could I foresee;
But I learned how the wind would sound
  After these things should be.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "The New House" by Edward Thomas is written in free verse, which means it does not adhere to a specific rhyme scheme or meter. The lack of rhyme and regular meter gives the poem a sense of natural speech and reflects the speaker's contemplative and introspective mood. The poem consists of four quatrains, each with four lines, creating a sense of stability and order within the structure. The simplicity of the form allows the focus to be on the content and emotions conveyed in the poem.

### Themes and Imagery

The central themes of the poem revolve around the passage of time, aging, and the inevitability of change. The image of the new house symbolizes a new beginning, but as the speaker enters, he immediately feels a sense of oldness and foreboding. The wind, a common motif in literature symbolizing change and uncertainty, adds to the atmosphere of unease and anticipation. The imagery of nights of storm and days of mist conveys a sense of gloom and uncertainty about the future. The contrast between the new house and the speaker's feelings of age and weariness highlights the theme of transition and the cyclical nature of life.

### Literary Devices

Thomas uses personification in the poem to give life to the house and the wind. The house is described as "old at once," emphasizing its age and history, while the wind "began to moan," creating a sense of foreboding and unease. The repetition of the word "old" throughout the poem reinforces the theme of aging and the passage of time. The use of vivid imagery, such as "Nights of storm, days of mist," creates a sense of atmosphere and sets the tone for the poem. The contrast between the new house and the speaker's feelings adds depth to the poem and emphasizes the speaker's internal conflict.

### Historical and Personal Context

Edward Thomas was a poet who often explored themes of nature, time, and mortality in his work. He wrote during a time of great social and political upheaval, with World War I looming on the horizon. The sense of foreboding and uncertainty in "The New House" may reflect Thomas's own anxieties about the future and the changing world around him. The poem can be seen as a reflection on the inevitability of change and the fear of the unknown that comes with it.

### Deep Reading

At its core, "The New House" delves into the universal experience of facing the unknown and the passage of time. The speaker's sense of isolation and apprehension in the new house mirrors the feelings of uncertainty and fear that accompany major life transitions. The poem captures the bittersweet realization that with every new beginning comes an end, and that change is an inescapable part of life. Through its use of vivid imagery and introspective tone, the poem invites readers to reflect on their own feelings of anticipation and trepidation when facing the unknown. It serves as a poignant reminder of the impermanence of all things and the inevitability of change.

## Sonnet by Rupert Brooke

```
Not with vain tears, when we’re beyond the sun,
We’ll beat on the substantial doors, nor tread
Those dusty high-roads of the aimless dead
Plaintive for Earth; but rather turn and run
Down some close-covered by-way of the air,
Some low sweet alley between wind and wind,
Stoop under faint gleams, thread the shadows, find
Some whispering ghost-forgotten nook, and there

Spend in pure converse our eternal day;
Think each in each, immediately wise;
Learn all we lacked before; hear, know, and say
What this tumultuous body now denies;
And feel, who have laid our groping hands away;
And see, no longer blinded by our eyes.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme
In this sonnet by Rupert Brooke, the poem follows the traditional structure of a sonnet, consisting of fourteen lines with a rhyme scheme of ABBA ABBA CDCDCD. The meter of the poem is predominantly iambic pentameter, with lines having ten syllables each and following a stressed-unstressed pattern. This consistent structure adds a sense of formality and control to the poem, reflecting the speaker's contemplative tone.

### Themes and Imagery
The central theme of the poem revolves around the idea of transcending death and finding solace in a peaceful afterlife. Brooke uses vivid imagery to convey this concept, such as "close-covered by-way of the air," "low sweet alley between wind and wind," and "whispering ghost-forgotten nook." These images evoke a sense of serenity and tranquility, suggesting a departure from the earthly realm into a more ethereal and harmonious existence.

### Literary Devices
Brooke employs several literary devices to enhance the poem's meaning. One notable device is the use of personification, as seen in the lines "Those dusty high-roads of the aimless dead" and "Learn all we lacked before." Personifying death and knowledge adds depth to the poem, giving abstract concepts human-like qualities that readers can relate to. Additionally, the poem contains metaphors such as "Some whispering ghost-forgotten nook," which symbolizes a hidden place of introspection and revelation. These literary devices contribute to the overall richness of the poem.

### Historical and Personal Context
Rupert Brooke was a prominent poet during World War I, known for his patriotic and romanticized portrayals of war. However, this sonnet diverges from his usual themes of conflict and nationalism, focusing instead on the afterlife and the transcendence of earthly limitations. This shift in focus may have been influenced by the devastating effects of the war on Brooke's generation, prompting him to contemplate themes of mortality and spiritual renewal in his poetry.

### Deep Reading
The closing lines of the poem, "And feel, who have laid our groping hands away; / And see, no longer blinded by our eyes," suggest a profound transformation beyond physical existence. The speaker envisions a realm where the limitations of the body no longer hinder understanding and perception. This depiction of a transcendent state emphasizes the idea of spiritual enlightenment and liberation from earthly constraints. Through this vision of an eternal day spent in pure converse and wisdom, Brooke offers a poignant reflection on the possibility of finding peace and fulfillment beyond the realm of the living.

## How still, how happy! by Emily Bronte

```
How still, how happy! Those are words
That once would scarce agree together;
I loved the plashing of the surge -
The changing heaven the breezy weather,

More than smooth seas and cloudless skies
And solemn, soothing, softened airs
That in the forest woke no sighs
And from the green spray shook no tears.

How still, how happy! now I feel
Where silence dwells is sweeter far
Than laughing mirth's most joyous swell
However pure its raptures are.

Come, sit down on this sunny stone:
'Tis wintry light o'er flowerless moors -
But sit - for we are all alone
And clear expand heaven's breathless shores.

I could think in the withered grass
Spring's budding wreaths we might discern;
The violet's eye might shyly flash
And young leaves shoot among the fern.

It is but thought - full many a night
The snow shall clothe those hills afar
And storms shall add a drearier blight
And winds shall wage a wilder war,

Before the lark may herald in
Fresh foliage twined with blossoms fair
And summer days again begin
Their glory - haloed crown to wear.

Yet my heart loves December's smile
As much as July's golden beam;
Then let us sit and watch the while
The blue ice curdling on the stream -
```
