Unless thou know'st the Tune
Or every Bird will point at thee
Because a Bard too soon --

The imagery of birds pointing at the speaker if they touch the guitar too soon implies a sense of warning against rushing into experiences without proper understanding.

### Literary Devices

The personification of birds "pointing" at the speaker adds to the imagery and creates a sense of warning and judgment.

Overall, the poem encourages a mindful and respectful approach to nature, highlighting the importance of listening and learning before engaging with the natural world.

## The Cuckoo by Edward Thomas

```
THAT'S the cuckoo, you say. I cannot hear it.
When last I heard it I cannot recall; but I know
Too well the year when first I failed to hear it--
It was drowned by my man groaning out to his
    sheep "Ho! Ho!"

Ten times with an angry voice he shouted
"Ho! Ho!" but not in anger, for that was his
    way.
He died that Summer, and that is how I remember
The cuckoo calling, the children listening, and me
    saying, "Nay."

And now, as you said, "There it is," I was hearing
Not the cuckoo at all, but my man's "Ho! Ho!"
    instead.
And I think that even if I could lose my deafness
The cuckoo's note would be drowned by the voice
    of my dead.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "The Cuckoo" by Edward Thomas consists of four stanzas, each with varying line lengths. The first stanza has five lines, the second and third stanzas have six lines each, and the final stanza has four lines. This irregular structure mirrors the speaker's fragmented thoughts and memories, adding to the overall sense of disorientation and confusion. There is no consistent meter or rhyme scheme, contributing to the poem's conversational and reflective tone.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem revolves around memory, loss, and the passage of time. The speaker struggles to remember the last time he heard the cuckoo, but vividly recalls the year when he first failed to hear it due to his man's interruption. The imagery of the man shouting "Ho! Ho!" to his sheep serves as a poignant reminder of mortality and the impermanence of life. The cuckoo's call symbolizes the fleeting nature of time and the speaker's inability to escape the memories of the past.

### Literary Devices

Thomas employs several literary devices to enhance the poem's emotional depth. The repetition of "Ho! Ho!" in the second stanza creates a sense of rhythm and echoes the man's voice ringing in the speaker's memory. The juxtaposition of the cuckoo's call with the man's voice highlights the speaker's internal conflict and his struggle to reconcile the past with the present. The use of enjambment throughout the poem emphasizes the speaker's fragmented thoughts and reinforces the theme of memory and loss.

### Historical and Personal Context

Edward Thomas wrote "The Cuckoo" during the early 20th century, a time marked by great social and political upheaval. The poem reflects Thomas's own experiences with loss and grief, as he grappled with the devastation of World War I and the loss of loved ones. The mention of the man's death in the Summer adds a personal dimension to the poem, suggesting that the speaker's memories are intertwined with his own experiences of mortality and sorrow.

### Deep Reading

At its core, "The Cuckoo" delves into the complexities of memory and how past experiences shape our present perceptions. The speaker's inability to differentiate between the cuckoo's call and the man's voice underscores the intertwined nature of memory and grief. The repeated refrain of "Ho! Ho!" serves as a haunting reminder of loss and the ways in which the past continues to echo in the present. Ultimately, the poem conveys a sense of longing for the past and the impossibility of escaping the ghosts of memory.

## Little Brown Baby by Paul Laurence Dunbar

Little brown baby wif spa'klin' eyes,
Come to yo' pappy an' set on his knee.

Look at dat bib -- you's es du'ty ez me.

Little brown baby wif spa'klin' eyes,
Who's pappy's darlin' an' who's pappy's chile?
Who is it all de day nevah once tries
Fu' to be cross, er once loses dat smile?
Whah did you git dem teef? My, you's a scamp!
Whah did dat dimple come f'om in yo' chin?
Pappy do' know you -- I b'lieves you's a tramp;
Mammy, dis hyeah's some ol' straggler got in!

Let's th'ow him outen de do' in de san',
We do' want stragglers a-layin' 'roun' hyeah;
Let's gin him 'way to de big buggah-man;
I know he's hidin' erroun' hyeah right neah.
Buggah-man, buggah-man, come in de do',
Hyeah's a bad boy you kin have fu' to eat.
Mammy an' pappy do' want him no mo',
Swaller him down f'om his haid to his feet!

Dah, now, I t'ought dat you'd hug me up close.
Go back, ol' buggah, you sha'n't have dis boy.
He ain't no tramp, ner no straggler, of co'se;
He's pappy's pa'dner an' play-mate an' joy.
Come to you' pallet now -- go to yo' res';
Wisht you could allus know ease an' cleah skies;
Wisht you could stay jes' a chile on my breas'--
Little brown baby wif spa'klin' eyes!
```
