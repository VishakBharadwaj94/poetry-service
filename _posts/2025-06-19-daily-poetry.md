## From Sunset to Star Rise by Christina Rossetti

```
Go from me, summer friends, and tarry not:
I am no summer friend, but wintry cold,
A silly sheep benighted from the fold,
A sluggard with a thorn-choked garden plot.
Take counsel, sever from my lot your lot,
Dwell in your pleasant places, hoard your gold;
Lest you with me should shiver on the wold,
Athirst and hungering on a barren spot.
For I have hedged me with a thorny hedge,
I live alone, I look to die alone:
Yet sometimes, when a wind sighs through the sedge,
Ghosts of my buried years, and friends come back,
My heart goes sighing after swallows flown
On sometime summer's unreturning track.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme
The poem "From Sunset to Star Rise" by Christina Rossetti consists of a single stanza with 14 lines. It follows a structured rhyme scheme of ABABCCDDEFFGG. The poem is written in iambic pentameter, with five stressed syllables per line. The consistent rhyme scheme and meter give the poem a sense of cohesion and musicality.

### Themes and Imagery
The poem explores themes of loneliness, isolation, and the passage of time. The speaker describes themselves as a "silly sheep benighted from the fold" and a "sluggard with a thorn-choked garden plot," illustrating feelings of being lost and trapped in a barren, desolate place. The imagery of a thorny hedge symbolizes the barriers the speaker has put up to protect themselves from further pain and isolation.

### Literary Devices
Rossetti employs various literary devices in the poem, including metaphor, personification, and alliteration. The use of metaphor is evident in lines such as "A silly sheep benighted from the fold," where the speaker compares themselves to a lost sheep. Personification is seen in the line "when a wind sighs through the sedge," giving human-like qualities to the wind. Alliteration is present in phrases like "summer friends" and "shiver on the wold," adding a musical quality to the poem.

### Historical and Personal Context
Christina Rossetti, a Victorian poet, often explored themes of love, loss, and spirituality in her work. It is possible that the poem reflects Rossetti's own feelings of loneliness and isolation, as she struggled with personal challenges throughout her life. The imagery of being alone, hedged in by thorns, may also reflect the societal constraints placed on women during the Victorian era.

### Deep Reading
The final lines of the poem, "My heart goes sighing after swallows flown / On sometime summer's unreturning track," convey a sense of nostalgia and longing for the past. The speaker yearns for the return of happier times, represented by the swallows of summer. This longing for a lost past highlights the theme of time passing and the inevitability of change. Despite the speaker's isolation and barriers, there is a sense of vulnerability and longing beneath the surface, revealing a complex emotional landscape.

## I cried at Pity -- not at Pain -- by Emily Dickinson

```
I cried at Pity -- not at Pain --
I heard a Woman say
"Poor Child" -- and something in her voice
Convicted me -- of me --

So long I fainted, to myself
It seemed the common way,
And Health, and Laughter, Curious things --
To look at, like a Toy --

To sometimes hear "Rich people" buy
And see the Parcel rolled --
And carried, I supposed -- to Heaven,
For children, made of Gold --

But not to touch, or wish for,
Or think of, with a sigh --
And so and so -- had been to me,
Had God willed differently.

I wish I knew that Woman's name --
So when she comes this way,
To hold my life, and hold my ears
For fear I hear her say

She's "sorry I am dead" -- again --
Just when the Grave and I --
Have sobbed ourselves almost to sleep,
Our only Lullaby --
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

This poem by Emily Dickinson consists of five quatrains with a rhyme scheme of ABCB. The lines are generally short, with irregular meter and no consistent rhythm, which is typical of Dickinson's style. The lack of a strict meter and rhyme scheme allows the poem to flow naturally and gives it a conversational tone. The enjambment between lines creates a sense of continuity, reflecting the speaker's stream of consciousness as she reflects on her emotions.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem is the speaker's emotional response to pity, as opposed to pain. The speaker reflects on her own lack of emotional reaction to pain, but is moved to tears by a woman's expression of pity. This contrast between pity and pain highlights the speaker's emotional vulnerability and her struggle to understand her own feelings. The imagery in the poem is vivid and evocative, particularly in lines like "And Health, and Laughter, Curious things -- / To look at, like a Toy --" which conveys the speaker's detachment from emotions that others find natural and comforting.

### Literary Devices

Dickinson employs several literary devices in this poem to enhance its meaning. The use of enjambment creates a sense of flow and continuity, reflecting the speaker's introspective and emotional journey. The repetition of the word "And" at the beginning of lines in the third stanza emphasizes the speaker's detachment from material possessions and her longing for emotional connection. The use of simile in lines like "To look at, like a Toy --" adds depth to the imagery and conveys the speaker's sense of distance from the world around her.

### Historical and Personal Context

Emily Dickinson was known for her introspective and often melancholic poetry, which reflected her own struggles with emotional and psychological issues. This poem explores themes of empathy, emotional vulnerability, and the complexity of human emotions. Dickinson's personal experiences of isolation and emotional turmoil likely influenced the themes and tone of the poem. The poem also reflects the societal norms and expectations of the time, where expressions of emotion were often repressed or suppressed.

### Deep Reading

At its core, "I cried at Pity -- not at Pain --" delves into the intricacies of human emotions and the complexities of empathy. The speaker's emotional response to pity rather than pain suggests a deep sensitivity and a profound capacity for empathy. The contrast between the speaker's own emotional detachment and her reaction to the woman's expression of pity highlights the speaker's internal struggle to connect with her own feelings. The poem ultimately serves as a meditation on the nature of compassion, vulnerability, and the power of emotional connection.

## Strayed Reveller, The by Matthew Arnold

```
The Youth

Faster, faster,
O Circe, Goddess,
Let the wild, thronging train
The bright procession
Of eddying forms,
Sweep through my soul!
Thou standest, smiling
Down on me! thy right arm,
Lean'd up against the column there,
Props thy soft cheek;
Thy left holds, hanging loosely,
The deep cup, ivy-cinctured,
I held but now.
Is it, then, evening
So soon? I see, the night-dews,
Cluster'd in thick beads, dim
The agate brooch-stones
On thy white shoulder;
The cool night-wind, too,
Blows through the portico,
Stirs thy hair, Goddess,
Waves thy white robe!


Circe.

Whence art thou, sleeper?


The Youth.

When the white dawn first
Through the rough fir-planks
Of my hut, by the chestnuts,
Up at the valley-head,
Came breaking, Goddess!
I sprang up, I threw round me
My dappled fawn-skin;
Passing out, from the wet turf,
Where they lay, by the hut door,
I snatch'd up my vine-crown, my fir-staff,
All drench'd in dew-
Came swift down to join
The rout early gather'd
In the town, round the temple,
Iacchus' white fane
On yonder hill.
Quick I pass'd, following
The wood-cutters' cart-track
Down the dark valley;-I saw
On my left, through the beeches,
Thy palace, Goddess,
Smokeless, empty!
Trembling, I enter'd; beheld
The court all silent,
The lions sleeping,
On the altar this bowl.
I drank, Goddess!
And sank down here, sleeping,
On the steps of thy portico.


Circe.

Foolish boy! Why tremblest thou?
Thou lovest it, then, my wine?
Wouldst more of it? See, how glows,
Through the delicate, flush'd marble,
The red, creaming liquor,
Strown with dark seeds!
Drink, thee! I chide thee not,
Deny thee not my bowl.
Come, stretch forth thy hand, thee-so!
Drink-drink again!


The Youth.

Thanks, gracious one!
Ah, the sweet fumes again!
More soft, ah me,
More subtle-winding
Than Pan's flute-music!
Faint-faint! Ah me,
Again the sweet sleep!


Circe.

Hist! Thou-within there!
Come forth, Ulysses!
Art tired with hunting?
While we range the woodland,
See what the day brings.


Ulysses.

Ever new magic!
Hast thou then lured hither,
Wonderful Goddess, by thy art,
The young, languid-eyed Ampelus,
Iacchus' darling-
Or some youth beloved of Pan,
Of Pan and the Nymphs?
That he sits, bending downward
His white, delicate neck
To the ivy-wreathed marge
Of thy cup; the bright, glancing vine-leaves
That crown his hair,
Falling forward, mingling
With the dark ivy-plants--
His fawn-skin, half untied,
Smear'd with red wine-stains? Who is he,
That he sits, overweigh'd
By fumes of wine and sleep,
So late, in thy portico?
What youth, Goddess,-what guest
Of Gods or mortals?


Circe.

Hist! he wakes!
I lured him not hither, Ulysses.
Nay, ask him!


The Youth.

Who speaks' Ah, who comes forth
To thy side, Goddess, from within?
How shall I name him?
This spare, dark-featured,
Quick-eyed stranger?
Ah, and I see too
His sailor's bonnet,
His short coat, travel-tarnish'd,
With one arm bare!--
Art thou not he, whom fame
This long time rumours
The favour'd guest of Circe, brought by the waves?
Art thou he, stranger?
The wise Ulysses,
Laertes' son?


Ulysses.

I am Ulysses.
And thou, too, sleeper?
Thy voice is sweet.
It may be thou hast follow'd
Through the islands some divine bard,
By age taught many things,
Age and the Muses;
And heard him delighting
The chiefs and people
In the banquet, and learn'd his songs.
Of Gods and Heroes,
Of war and arts,
And peopled cities,
Inland, or built
By the gray sea.-If so, then hail!
I honour and welcome thee.


The Youth.

The Gods are happy.
They turn on all sides
Their shining eyes,
And see below them
The earth and men.
They see Tiresias
Sitting, staff in hand,
On the warm, grassy
Asopus bank,
His robe drawn over
His old sightless head,
Revolving inly
The doom of Thebes.
They see the Centaurs
In the upper glens
Of Pelion, in the streams,
Where red-berried ashes fringe
The clear-brown shallow pools,
With streaming flanks, and heads
Rear'd proudly, snuffing
The mountain wind.
They see the Indian
Drifting, knife in hand,
His frail boat moor'd to
A floating isle thick-matted
With large-leaved, low-creeping melon-plants
And the dark cucumber.
He reaps, and stows them,
Drifting--drifting;--round him,
Round his green harvest-plot,
Flow the cool lake-waves,
The mountains ring them.
They see the Scythian
On the wide stepp, unharnessing
His wheel'd house at noon.
He tethers his beast down, and makes his meal--
Mares' milk, and bread
Baked on the embers;--all around
The boundless, waving grass-plains stretch, thick-starr'd
With saffron and the yellow hollyhock
And flag-leaved iris-flowers.
Sitting in his cart
He makes his meal; before him, for long miles,
Alive with bright green lizards,
And the springing bustard-fowl,
The track, a straight black line,
Furrows the rich soil; here and there
Cluster of lonely mounds
Topp'd with rough-hewn,
Gray, rain-blear'd statues, overpeer
The sunny waste.
They see the ferry
On the broad, clay-laden
Lone Chorasmian stream;--thereon,
With snort and strain,
Two horses, strongly swimming, tow
The ferry-boat, with woven ropes
To either bow
Firm harness'd by the mane; a chief
With shout and shaken spear,
Stands at the prow, and guides them; but astern
The cowering merchants, in long robes,
Sit pale beside their wealth
Of silk-bales and of balsam-drops,
Of gold and ivory,
Of turquoise-earth and amethyst,
Jasper and chalcedony,
And milk-barred onyx-stones.
The loaded boat swings groaning
In the yellow eddies;
The Gods behold him.
They see the Heroes
Sitting in the dark ship
On the foamless, long-heaving
Violet sea.
At sunset nearing
The Happy Islands.
These things, Ulysses,
The wise bards, also
Behold and sing.
But oh, what labour!
O prince, what pain!
They too can see
Tiresias;--but the Gods,
Who give them vision,
Added this law:
That they should bear too
His groping blindness,
His dark foreboding,
His scorn'd white hairs;
Bear Hera's anger
Through a life lengthen'd
To seven ages.
They see the Centaurs
On Pelion:--then they feel,
They too, the maddening wine
Swell their large veins to bursting; in wild pain
They feel the biting spears
Of the grim Lapithж, and Theseus, drive,
Drive crashing through their bones; they feel
High on a jutting rock in the red stream
Alcmena's dreadful son
Ply his bow;--such a price
The Gods exact for song:
To become what we sing.
They see the Indian
On his mountain lake; but squalls
Make their skiff reel, and worms
In the unkind spring have gnawn
Their melon-harvest to the heart.--They see
The Scythian: but long frosts
Parch them in winter-time on the bare stepp,
Till they too fade like grass; they crawl
Like shadows forth in spring.
They see the merchants
On the Oxus stream;--but care
Must visit first them too, and make them pale.
Whether, through whirling sand,
A cloud of desert robber-horse have burst
Upon their caravan; or greedy kings,
In the wall'd cities the way passes through,
Crush'd them with tolls; or fever-airs,
On some great river's marge,
Mown them down, far from home.
They see the Heroes
Near harbour;--but they share
Their lives, and former violent toil in Thebes,
Seven-gated Thebes, or Troy;
Or where the echoing oars
Of Argo first
Startled the unknown sea.
The old Silenus
Came, lolling in the sunshine,
From the dewy forest-coverts,
This way at noon.
Sitting by me, while his Fauns
Down at the water-side
Sprinkled and smoothed
His drooping garland,
He told me these things.
But I, Ulysses,
Sitting on the warm steps,
Looking over the valley,
All day long, have seen,
Without pain, without labour,
Sometimes a wild-hair'd Mжnad--
Sometimes a Faun with torches--
And sometimes, for a moment,
Passing through the dark stems
Flowing-robed, the beloved,
The desired, the divine,
Beloved Iacchus.
Ah, cool night-wind, tremulous stars!
Ah, glimmering water,
Fitful earth-murmur,
Dreaming woods!
Ah, golden-haired, strangely smiling Goddess,
And thou, proved, much enduring,
Wave-toss'd Wanderer!
Who can stand still?
Ye fade, ye swim, ye waver before me--
The cup again!
Faster, faster,
O Circe, Goddess.
Let the wild, thronging train,
The bright procession
Of eddying forms,
Sweep through my soul!

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

"The Strayed Reveller" by Matthew Arnold is a dramatic monologue that consists of a dialogue between the characters of The Youth, Circe, and Ulysses. The poem is written in free verse, with no specific rhyme scheme or meter, allowing for a more natural and conversational tone. The lack of rhyme and meter in this poem contributes to its conversational style, making the interactions between the characters feel more immediate and real. The poem is divided into three distinct sections, each marked by a change in speaker and a shift in the conversation, creating a sense of progression and development within the narrative.

### Themes and Imagery

One of the central themes of "The Strayed Reveller" is the allure of indulgence and escapism. The Youth is seduced by Circe's wine and the dreamlike world she offers, symbolizing the temptation to retreat from reality and seek pleasure in excess. The imagery in the poem is rich and vivid, painting a picture of a mystical and enchanting world. Arnold uses sensory details like the night-dews on Circe's shoulder, the red, creaming liquor in her cup, and the cool night-wind blowing through the portico to create a sensory experience for the reader. The setting of Circe's palace and the references to Greek mythology add to the dreamlike and fantastical atmosphere of the poem.

### Literary Devices

Arnold employs several literary devices in "The Strayed Reveller" to enhance the depth and complexity of the poem. One notable device is the use of allusion to Greek mythology, with references to Circe, Ulysses, and other mythological figures. This adds layers of meaning and symbolism to the poem, as Circe represents temptation and Ulysses represents wisdom and experience. The poem also features imagery, such as the agate brooch-stones on Circe's shoulder and the fumes of her wine, which serve to create a sensory experience for the reader. Additionally, the dialogue between the characters and the shifting perspectives help to develop the narrative and add depth to the themes explored in the poem.

### Historical and Personal Context

Matthew Arnold was a Victorian poet and critic known for his introspective and philosophical poetry. "The Strayed Reveller" was written in the mid-19th century, a time of great social and cultural change in England. The poem reflects Arnold's interest in Greek mythology and his exploration of themes related to human nature and the pursuit of pleasure. The character of The Youth can be seen as a representation of youthful folly and the dangers of giving in to temptation, while Ulysses represents wisdom and self-control. The poem can also be read as a commentary on the moral dilemmas and existential questions faced by individuals in a rapidly changing world.

### Deep Reading

"The Strayed Reveller" delves into the complexities of human nature, exploring the tension between indulgence and self-control, pleasure and wisdom. The character of The Youth is lured by Circe's wine and the promise of escape from reality, symbolizing the seductive power of indulgence and the dangers of losing oneself in hedonism. In contrast, Ulysses embodies restraint and experience, offering a counterbalance to The Youth's reckless abandon. The dialogue between the characters highlights the eternal struggle between desire and reason, between the pursuit of pleasure and the pursuit of truth. Ultimately, the poem serves as a cautionary tale about the consequences of succumbing to temptation and the importance of self-awareness and self-control in navigating the complexities of human existence.
