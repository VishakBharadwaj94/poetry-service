## Absent Place -- an April Day -- by Emily Dickinson

```
Absent Place -- an April Day --
Daffodils a-blow
Homesick curiosity
To the Souls that snow --

Drift may block within it
Deeper than without --
Daffodil delight but
Him it duplicate --
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

This poem by Emily Dickinson consists of four quatrains, each with four lines. The rhyme scheme is AABB, giving the poem a structured and cohesive feel. The meter is irregular, with varying syllable counts in each line, adding to the poem's unique and individualistic style. The lack of a consistent meter reflects Dickinson's unconventional approach to poetry and allows for a more natural flow of thought and emotion.

### Themes and Imagery

The themes of longing, nostalgia, and the passage of time are prominent in this poem. The title "Absent Place -- an April Day --" sets the tone of absence and yearning, with the mention of daffodils in bloom evoking a sense of fleeting beauty and transience. The imagery of "Homesick curiosity" and "Souls that snow" suggests a deep emotional longing and a connection to nature that transcends physical boundaries. The contrast between the external world ("Deeper than without") and internal emotions ("Him it duplicate") adds a layer of complexity to the poem's themes.

### Literary Devices

Dickinson uses various literary devices to enhance the poem's meaning and emotional impact. The repetition of the word "Daffodil" emphasizes the speaker's fascination with this flower and its symbolic significance. The use of enjambment, particularly in lines like "Homesick curiosity / To the Souls that snow," creates a sense of fluidity and movement, mirroring the speaker's shifting thoughts and emotions. Additionally, the personification of nature as having the ability to "duplicate" the absent loved one adds depth to the poem's imagery and themes.

### Historical and Personal Context

Emily Dickinson's poems often explore themes of nature, mortality, and the inner workings of the human mind. As a recluse who spent much of her life in isolation, Dickinson's poetry reflects her introspective nature and deep emotional sensitivity. This poem, with its focus on absence and longing, may draw from Dickinson's own experiences of solitude and longing for connection.

### Deep Reading

At its core, "Absent Place -- an April Day --" captures the universal experience of yearning for something or someone that is no longer present. The juxtaposition of the external world with internal emotions highlights the complex interplay between nature and the human psyche. The daffodils, blooming in April, symbolize renewal and rebirth, yet the speaker's sense of homesickness and curiosity suggests a deeper longing that transcends the changing seasons. Ultimately, the poem conveys a poignant meditation on the passage of time and the enduring power of memory and longing.

## Lines Written In Early Spring by William Wordsworth

```
I heard a thousand blended notes,
While in a grove I sate reclined,
In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts
Bring sad thoughts to the mind.

To her fair works did Nature link
The human soul that through me ran;
And much it grieved my heart to think
What man has made of man.

Through primrose tufts, in that green bower,
The periwinkle trailed its wreaths;
And 'tis my faith that every flower
Enjoys the air it breathes.

The birds around me hopped and played,
Their thoughts I cannot measure:--
But the least motion which they made
It seemed a thrill of pleasure.

The budding twigs spread out their fan,
To catch the breezy air;
And I must think, do all I can,
That there was pleasure there.

If this belief from heaven be sent,
If such be Nature's holy plan,
Have I not reason to lament
What man has made of man?
```

## An Old Song by Edward Thomas

```
THE sun set, the wind fell, the sea
Was like a mirror shaking:
The one small wave that clapped the land
A mile-long snake of foam was making
Where tide had smoothed and wind had dried
The vacant sand.

A light divided the swollen clouds
And lay most perfectly
Like a straight narrow footbridge bright
That crossed over the sea to me;
And no one else in the whole world
Saw that same sight.

I walked elate, my bridge always
Just one step from my feet:
A robin sang, a shade in shade:
And all I did was to repeat:
"I'll go no more a-roving
With you, fair maid."

The sailors' song of merry loving
With dusk and sea-gull's mewing
Mixed sweet, the lewdness far outweighed
By the wild charm the chorus played:
"I'll go no more a-roving
With you, fair maid:
A-roving, a-roving, since roving's been my ruin,
I'll go no more a-roving with you, fair maid."

_In Amsterdam there dwelt a maid--
Mark well what I do say--
In Amsterdam there dwelt a maid
And she was a mistress of her trade:
I'll go no more a-roving
With you, fair maid:
A-roving, a-roving, since roving's been my ruin,
I'll go no more a-roving with you, fair maid._
```
