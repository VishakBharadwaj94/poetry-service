## Aurora Leigh (excerpts) by Elizabeth Barrett Browning

```
[Book 1]
I am like,
They tell me, my dear father. Broader brows
Howbeit, upon a slenderer undergrowth
Of delicate features, -- paler, near as grave ;
But then my mother's smile breaks up the whole,
And makes it better sometimes than itself.
So, nine full years, our days were hid with God
Among his mountains : I was just thirteen,
Still growing like the plants from unseen roots
In tongue-tied Springs, -- and suddenly awoke
To full life and life 's needs and agonies,
With an intense, strong, struggling heart beside
A stone-dead father. Life, struck sharp on death,
Makes awful lightning. His last word was, `Love --'
`Love, my child, love, love !' -- (then he had done with grief)
`Love, my child.' Ere I answered he was gone,
And none was left to love in all the world.
There, ended childhood. What succeeded next
I recollect as, after fevers, men
Thread back the passage of delirium,
Missing the turn still, baffled by the door ;
Smooth endless days, notched here and there with knives ;
A weary, wormy darkness, spurr'd i' the flank
With flame, that it should eat and end itself
Like some tormented scorpion. Then at last
I do remember clearly, how there came
A stranger with authority, not right,
(I thought not) who commanded, caught me up
From old Assunta's neck ; how, with a shriek,
She let me go, -- while I, with ears too full
Of my father's silence, to shriek back a word,
In all a child's astonishment at grief
Stared at the wharf-edge where she stood and moaned,
My poor Assunta, where she stood and moaned !
The white walls, the blue hills, my Italy,
Drawn backward from the shuddering steamer-deck,
Like one in anger drawing back her skirts
Which supplicants catch at. Then the bitter sea
Inexorably pushed between us both,
And sweeping up the ship with my despair
Threw us out as a pasture to the stars.
Ten nights and days we voyaged on the deep ;
Ten nights and days, without the common face
Of any day or night ; the moon and sun
Cut off from the green reconciling earth,
To starve into a blind ferocity
And glare unnatural ; the very sky
(Dropping its bell-net down upon the sea
As if no human heart should 'scape alive,)
Bedraggled with the desolating salt,
Until it seemed no more that holy heaven
To which my father went. All new and strange
The universe turned stranger, for a child.
Then, land ! -- then, England ! oh, the frosty cliffs
Looked cold upon me. Could I find a home
Among those mean red houses through the fog ?
And when I heard my father's language first
From alien lips which had no kiss for mine
I wept aloud, then laughed, then wept, then wept,
And some one near me said the child was mad
Through much sea-sickness. The train swept us on.
Was this my father's England ? the great isle ?
The ground seemed cut up from the fellowship
Of verdure, field from field, as man from man ;
The skies themselves looked low and positive,
As almost you could touch them with a hand,
And dared to do it they were so far off
From God's celestial crystals ; all things blurred
And dull and vague. Did Shakspeare and his mates
Absorb the light here ? -- not a hill or stone
With heart to strike a radiant colour up
Or active outline on the indifferent air.
I think I see my father's sister stand
Upon the hall-step of her country-house
To give me welcome. She stood straight and calm,
Her somewhat narrow forehead braided tight
As if for taming accidental thoughts
From possible pulses ; brown hair pricked with grey
By frigid use of life, (she was not old
Although my father's elder by a year)
A nose drawn sharply yet in delicate lines ;
A close mild mouth, a little soured about
The ends, through speaking unrequited loves
Or peradventure niggardly half-truths ;
Eyes of no colour, -- once they might have smiled,
But never, never have forgot themselves
In smiling ; cheeks, in which was yet a rose
Of perished summers, like a rose in a book,
Kept more for ruth than pleasure, -- if past bloom,
Past fading also.
She had lived, we'll say,
A harmless life, she called a virtuous life,
A quiet life, which was not life at all,
(But that, she had not lived enough to know)
Between the vicar and the country squires,
The lord-lieutenant looking down sometimes
From the empyrean to assure their souls
Against chance-vulgarisms, and, in the abyss
The apothecary, looked on once a year
To prove their soundness of humility.
The poor-club exercised her Christian gifts
Of knitting stockings, stitching petticoats,
Because we are of one flesh after all
And need one flannel (with a proper sense
Of difference in the quality) -- and still
The book-club, guarded from your modern trick
Of shaking dangerous questions from the crease,
Preserved her intellectual. She had lived
A sort of cage-bird life, born in a cage,
Accounting that to leap from perch to perch
Was act and joy enough for any bird.
Dear heaven, how silly are the things that live
In thickets, and eat berries !
I, alas,
A wild bird scarcely fledged, was brought to her cage,
And she was there to meet me. Very kind.
Bring the clean water, give out the fresh seed.
She stood upon the steps to welcome me,
Calm, in black garb. I clung about her neck, --
Young babes, who catch at every shred of wool
To draw the new light closer, catch and cling
Less blindly. In my ears, my father's word
Hummed ignorantly, as the sea in shells,
`Love, love, my child.' She, black there with my grief,
Might feel my love -- she was his sister once,
I clung to her. A moment, she seemed moved,
Kissed me with cold lips, suffered me to cling,
And drew me feebly through the hall into
The room she sate in.
There, with some strange spasm
Of pain and passion, she wrung loose my hands
Imperiously, and held me at arm's length,
And with two grey-steel naked-bladed eyes
Searched through my face, -- ay, stabbed it through and through,
Through brows and cheeks and chin, as if to find
A wicked murderer in my innocent face,
If not here, there perhaps. Then, drawing breath,
She struggled for her ordinary calm
And missed it rather, -- told me not to shrink,
As if she had told me not to lie or swear, --
`She loved my father, and would love me too
As long as I deserved it.' Very kind.

[Book 5]

AURORA LEIGH, be humble. Shall I hope
To speak my poems in mysterious tune
With man and nature ? -- with the lava-lymph
That trickles from successive galaxies
Still drop by drop adown the finger of God
In still new worlds ? -- with summer-days in this ?
That scarce dare breathe they are so beautiful ?--
With spring's delicious trouble in the ground,
Tormented by the quickened blood of roots,
And softly pricked by golden crocus-sheaves
In token of the harvest-time of flowers ?--
With winters and with autumns, -- and beyond,
With the human heart's large seasons, when it hopes
And fears, joys, grieves, and loves ? -- with all that strain
Of sexual passion, which devours the flesh
In a sacrament of souls ? with mother's breasts
Which, round the new-made creatures hanging there,
Throb luminous and harmonious like pure spheres ? --
With multitudinous life, and finally
With the great escapings of ecstatic souls,
Who, in a rush of too long prisoned flame,
Their radiant faces upward, burn away
This dark of the body, issuing on a world,
Beyond our mortal ? -- can I speak my verse
Sp plainly in tune to these things and the rest,
That men shall feel it catch them on the quick,
As having the same warrant over them
To hold and move them if they will or no,
Alike imperious as the primal rhythm
Of that theurgic nature ? I must fail,
Who fail at the beginning to hold and move
One man, -- and he my cousin, and he my friend,
And he born tender, made intelligent,
Inclined to ponder the precipitous sides
Of difficult questions ; yet, obtuse to me,
Of me, incurious ! likes me very well,
And wishes me a paradise of good,
Good looks, good means, and good digestion, -- ay,
But otherwise evades me, puts me off
With kindness, with a tolerant gentleness, --
Too light a book for a grave man's reading ! Go,
Aurora Leigh : be humble.
There it is,
We women are too apt to look to One,
Which proves a certain impotence in art.
We strain our natures at doing something great,
Far less because it 's something great to do,
Than haply that we, so, commend ourselves
As being not small, and more appreciable
To some one friend. We must have mediators
Betwixt our highest conscience and the judge ;
Some sweet saint's blood must quicken in our palms
Or all the life in heaven seems slow and cold :
Good only being perceived as the end of good,
And God alone pleased, -- that's too poor, we think,
And not enough for us by any means.
Ay, Romney, I remember, told me once
We miss the abstract when we comprehend.
We miss it most when we aspire, -- and fail.
Yet, so, I will not. -- This vile woman's way
Of trailing garments, shall not trip me up :
I 'll have no traffic with the personal thought
In art's pure temple. Must I work in vain,
Without the approbation of a man ?
It cannot be ; it shall not. Fame itself,
That approbation of the general race,
Presents a poor end, (though the arrow speed,
Shot straight with vigorous finger to the white,)
And the highest fame was never reached except
By what was aimed above it. Art for art,
And good for God Himself, the essential Good !
We 'll keep our aims sublime, our eyes erect,
Although our woman-hands should shake and fail ;
And if we fail .. But must we ? --
Shall I fail ?
The Greeks said grandly in their tragic phrase,
`Let no one be called happy till his death.'
To which I add, -- Let no one till his death
Be called unhappy. Measure not the work
Until the day 's out and the labour done,
Then bring your gauges. If the day's work 's scant,
Why, call it scant ; affect no compromise ;
And, in that we have nobly striven at least,
Deal with us nobly, women though we be.
And honour us with truth if not with praise.

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme
In "Aurora Leigh," Elizabeth Barrett Browning utilizes a narrative poem structure, divided into books, to tell the story of the protagonist's life. The poem is written in blank verse, a form of poetry that does not rhyme but maintains iambic pentameter, providing a sense of rhythm and flow. Browning's use of enjambment, where the sentence or phrase continues onto the next line without a pause, adds to the natural and conversational tone of the poem. The lack of rhyme scheme allows the focus to be on the narrative itself, emphasizing the emotional depth and complexity of the protagonist's journey.

### Themes and Imagery
One of the central themes in "Aurora Leigh" is the struggle for identity and self-discovery, particularly for a woman in a patriarchal society. The imagery of the natural world, such as "summer-days," "spring's delicious trouble," and "golden crocus-sheaves," symbolizes growth, renewal, and the cycles of life. The sea and voyage imagery represent the protagonist's journey of self-realization and the challenges she faces in finding her place in the world. The contrast between Italy and England reflects the protagonist's internal conflict and sense of displacement.

### Literary Devices
Browning employs various literary devices in "Aurora Leigh" to enhance the narrative and evoke emotion. The use of imagery, such as "lava-lymph" and "summer-days," creates vivid and sensory descriptions that immerse the reader in the protagonist's experiences. The repetition of the word "love" in the opening lines of the poem emphasizes the theme of love and loss. Browning also uses simile, metaphor, and personification to convey complex emotions and ideas, such as comparing the protagonist to a "wild bird scarcely fledged" and describing the sea as "bitter" and "inexorable."

### Historical and Personal Context
Elizabeth Barrett Browning wrote "Aurora Leigh" during the Victorian era, a time when women faced limited opportunities for self-expression and autonomy. The poem reflects Browning's own experiences and beliefs about gender roles, social injustice, and the power of art to challenge societal norms. As a female poet, Browning used her writing to advocate for women's rights and to explore themes of female creativity, independence, and self-fulfillment.

### Deep Reading
Through the character of Aurora Leigh, Browning explores the complexities of womanhood and the struggle for self-empowerment in a male-dominated world. The protagonist's journey from childhood trauma to artistic self-realization mirrors Browning's own quest for personal and creative freedom. The poem challenges traditional gender roles and societal expectations, advocating for women's agency and the pursuit of individual purpose and fulfillment. Browning's lyrical and introspective style invites readers to reflect on their own identities, aspirations, and the transformative power of art.

## A Memory by Rupert Brooke

```
(From a sonnet-sequence)


Somewhile before the dawn I rose, and stept
Softly along the dim way to your room,
And found you sleeping in the quiet gloom,
And holiness about you as you slept.
I knelt there; till your waking fingers crept
About my head, and held it. I had rest
Unhoped this side of Heaven, beneath your breast.
I knelt a long time, still; nor even wept.

It was great wrong you did me; and for gain
Of that poor moment’s kindliness, and ease,
And sleepy mother-comfort!
Child, you know
How easily love leaps out to dreams like these,
Who has seen them true. And love that’s wakened so
Takes all too long to lay asleep again.
```

## Protus by Robert Browning

```
Among these latter busts we count by scores,
Half-emperors and quarter-emperors,
Each with his bay-leaf fillet, loose-thonged vest,
Loric and low-browed Gorgon on the breast,
One loves a baby face, with violets there,
Violets instead of laurel in the hair,
As those were all the little locks could bear.

Now, read here. "Protus ends a period
Of empery beginning with a god;
Born in the porphyry chamber at Byzant,
Queens by his cradle, proud and ministrant:
And if he quickened breath there, 'twould like fire
Pantingly through the dim vast realm transpire.
A fame that he was missing spread afar:
The world from its four corners, rose in war,
Till he was borne out on a balcony
To pacify the world when it should see.
The captains ranged before him, one, his hand
Made baby points at, gained the chief command.
And day by day more beautiful he grew
In shape, all said, in feature and in hue,
While young Greek sculptors, gazing on the child,
Became with old Greek sculpture reconciled.
Already sages laboured to condense
In easy tomes a life's experience:
And artists took grave counsel to impart
In one breath and one hand-sweep, all their art,
To make his graces prompt as blossoming
Of plentifully-watered palms in spring:
Since well beseems it, whoso mounts the throne,
For beauty, knowledge, strength, should stand alone,
And mortals love the letters of his name."

--Stop! Have you turned two pages?  Still the same.
New reign, same date.  The scribe goes on to say
How that same year, on such a month and day,
"John the Pannonian, groundedly believed
A blacksmith's bastard, whose hard hand reprieved
The Empire from its fate the year before,
Came, had a mind to take the crown, and wore
The same for six years (during which the Huns
Kept off their fingers from us), till his sons
Put something in his liquor"--and so forth.
Then a new reign.  Stay--"Take at its just worth"
(Subjoins an annotator) "what I give
As hearsay.  Some think, John let Protus live
And slip away.  'Tis said, he reached man's age
At some blind northern court; made, first a page,
Then tutor to the children; last, of use
About the hunting-stables.  I deduce
He wrote the little tract 'On worming dogs,'
Whereof the name in sundry catalogues
Is extant yet.  A Protus of the race
Is rumoured to have died a monk in Thrace,
And if the same, he reached senility."

Here's John the Smith's rough-hammered head.  Great eye,
Gross jaw and griped lips do what granite can
To give you the crown-grasper. What a man!
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme
The poem "Protus" by Robert Browning is written in free verse, with no consistent meter or rhyme scheme. The poem consists of one long stanza, with varying line lengths. This lack of rhyme and meter gives the poem a sense of informality and conversational tone, allowing the speaker to narrate the story in a more relaxed manner.

### Themes and Imagery
One of the central themes of the poem is the fleeting nature of power and legacy. Through the contrast between Protus, a figure surrounded by glory and artistic admiration, and John the Pannonian, a humble blacksmith's son who unexpectedly becomes emperor, Browning explores how power can be gained and lost in unexpected ways. The imagery of Protus as a beautiful and admired figure, contrasted with John's rough appearance, highlights the superficiality of power and the unpredictability of fate.

Additionally, the poem touches on themes of identity and transformation. Protus's mysterious disappearance and rumored reemergence as a monk in Thrace suggest a journey of self-discovery and reinvention. The image of a once-powerful emperor living out his days in obscurity as a monk adds layers of complexity to the narrative, inviting reflection on the nature of identity and the impermanence of earthly achievements.

### Literary Devices
Browning employs various literary devices in the poem, such as alliteration, imagery, and irony. The use of alliteration in phrases like "loose-thonged vest" and "grew In shape" adds a musical quality to the poem and draws attention to specific details. The vivid imagery of Protus's upbringing in a lavish court, contrasted with John the Pannonian's rugged background, creates a visual contrast that enhances the thematic exploration of power and identity.

Irony is also present in the poem, particularly in the contrast between Protus's perceived greatness and his eventual obscurity. The irony of a once-revered emperor ending his days as a monk adds a touch of cynicism to the narrative, underscoring the transient nature of human achievements.

### Historical and Personal Context
Robert Browning was a Victorian poet known for his dramatic monologues and exploration of complex psychological themes. "Protus" reflects Browning's interest in historical narratives and character studies, as he delves into the lives of two contrasting figures to explore themes of power, identity, and fate.

The poem also reflects the political and social upheaval of Browning's time, with references to wars, power struggles, and the capricious nature of leadership. Browning's portrayal of Protus and John the Pannonian as emblematic figures of power and downfall can be seen as a commentary on the turbulent political climate of the Victorian era.

### Deep Reading
At its core, "Protus" is a meditation on the transient nature of power and the complexities of human identity. Through the juxtaposition of Protus and John the Pannonian, Browning challenges traditional notions of greatness and success, suggesting that true significance lies not in outward displays of power, but in the authenticity of one's selfhood.

The poem invites readers to reflect on the ways in which we construct our identities and the fickle nature of worldly acclaim. By weaving together themes of power, identity, and transformation, Browning creates a nuanced portrait of human ambition and the elusive pursuit of lasting legacy. Ultimately, "Protus" serves as a poignant reminder of the impermanence of earthly achievements and the enduring mystery of the human soul.
