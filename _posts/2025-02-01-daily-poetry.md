## In Youth I Have Known One by Edgar Allan Poe

```
_How often we forget all time, when lone
Admiring Nature's universal throne;
Her woods--her wilds--her mountains--the intense
Reply of Hers to Our intelligence!_

In youth I have known one with whom the Earth
  In secret communing held--as he with it,
In daylight, and in beauty, from his birth:
  Whose fervid, flickering torch of life was lit
From the sun and stars, whence he had drawn forth
  A passionate light such for his spirit was fit--
And yet that spirit knew--not in the hour
  Of its own fervor--what had o'er it power.

Perhaps it may be that my mind is wrought
  To a ferver by the moonbeam that hangs o'er,
But I will half believe that wild light fraught
  With more of sovereignty than ancient lore
Hath ever told--or is it of a thought
  The unembodied essence, and no more
That with a quickening spell doth o'er us pass
  As dew of the night-time, o'er the summer grass?

Doth o'er us pass, when, as th' expanding eye
  To the loved object--so the tear to the lid
Will start, which lately slept in apathy?
  And yet it need not be--(that object) hid
From us in life--but common--which doth lie
  Each hour before us--but then only bid
With a strange sound, as of a harp-string broken
  T' awake us--'Tis a symbol and a token--

Of what in other worlds shall be--and given
  In beauty by our God, to those alone
Who otherwise would fall from life and Heaven
  Drawn by their heart's passion, and that tone,
That high tone of the spirit which hath striven
  Though not with Faith--with godliness--whose throne
With desperate energy 't hath beaten down;
  Wearing its own deep feeling as a crown.

## Incident of the French Camp by Robert Browning

```
You know, we French stormed Ratisbon:
  A mile or so away
On a little mound, Napoleon
  Stood on our storming-day;
With neck out-thrust, you fancy how,
  Legs wide, arms locked behind,
As if to balance the prone brow
  Oppressive with its mind.

Just as perhaps he mused "My plans
  That soar, to earth may fall,
Let once my army-leader Lannes
  Waver at yonder wall"--
Out 'twixt the battery-smokes there flew
  A rider, bound on bound
Full-galloping; nor bridle drew
  Until he reached the mound,

Then off there flung in smiling joy,
  And held himself erect
By just his horse's mane, a boy:
  You hardly could suspect--
(So tight he kept his lips compressed.
  Scarce any blood came through)
You looked twice ere you saw his breast
  Was all but shot in two.

"Well," cried he, "Emperor, by God's grace
  We've got you Ratisbon!
The Marshal's in the market-place,
  And you'll be there anon
To see your flag-bird flap his vans
  Where I, to heart's desire,
Perched him!" The chief's eye flashed; his plans
  Soared up again like fire.

The chief's eye flashed; but presently
  Softened itself, as sheathes
A film the mother-eagle's eye
  When her bruised eaglet breathes.
"You're wounded!" "Nay," the soldier's pride
  Touched to the quick, he said:
"I'm killed, Sire!" And his chief beside,
  Smiling, the boy fell dead.
```

## Lines Written In Early Spring by William Wordsworth

```
I heard a thousand blended notes,
While in a grove I sate reclined,
In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts
Bring sad thoughts to the mind.

To her fair works did Nature link
The human soul that through me ran;
And much it grieved my heart to think
What man has made of man.

Through primrose tufts, in that green bower,
The periwinkle trailed its wreaths;
And 'tis my faith that every flower
Enjoys the air it breathes.

The birds around me hopped and played,
Their thoughts I cannot measure:--
But the least motion which they made
It seemed a thrill of pleasure.

The budding twigs spread out their fan,
To catch the breezy air;
And I must think, do all I can,
That there was pleasure there.

If this belief from heaven be sent,
If such be Nature's holy plan,
Have I not reason to lament
What man has made of man?
```
