## A Grammarian's Funeral : Shortly After the Revival of Learning in Europe by Robert Browning

```
Let us begin and carry up this corpse,
      Singing together.
Leave we the common crofts, the vulgar thorpes,
      Each in its tether
Sleeping safe on the bosom of the plain,
      Cared-for till cock-crow:
Look out if yonder be not day again
      Rimming the rock-row!
That's the appropriate country; there, man's thought,
      Rarer, intenser,
Self-gathered for an outbreak, as it ought,
      Chafes in the censer.

Leave we the unlettered plain its herd and crop;
      Seek we sepulture
On a tall mountain, citied to the top,
      Crowded with culture!
All the peaks soar, but one the rest excels;
      Clouds overcome it;
No! yonder sparkle is the citadel's
      Circling its summit.
Thither our path lies; wind we up the heights:
      Wait ye the warning?
Our low life was the level's and the night's:
      He's for the morning.
Step to a tune, square chests, erect each head,
      'Ware the beholders!
This is our master, famous calm and dead,
      Borne on our shoulders.

Sleep, crop and herd! sleep, darkling thorpe and croft,
      Safe from the weather!
He, whom we convoy to his grave aloft,
      Singing together,
He was a man born with thy face and throat,
      Lyric Apollo!
Long he lived nameless: how should spring take note
      Winter would follow?
Till lo, the little touch, and youth was gone!
      Cramped and diminished,
Moaned he, "New measures, other feet anon!
      My dance is finished?"
No, that's the world's way; (keep the mountain-side,
      Make for the city!)
He knew the signal, and stepped on with pride
      Over men's pity;
Left play for work, and grappled with the world
      Bent on escaping:
"What's in the scroll," quoth he, "thou keepest furled?
      Show me their shaping,
Theirs who most studied man, the bard and sage,--
      Give!"--So, he gowned him,
Straight got by heart that book to its last page:
      Learned, we found him.
Yea, but we found him bald too, eyes like lead,
      Accents uncertain:
"Time to taste life," another would have said,
      "Up with the curtain!"
This man said rather, "Actual life comes next?
      Patience a moment!
Grant I have mastered learning's crabbed text,
      Still there's the comment.

Let me know all! Prate not of most or least,
      Painful or easy!
Even to the crumbs I'd fain eat up the feast,
      Ay, nor feel queasy."
Oh, such a life as he resolved to live,
      When he had learned it,
When he had gathered all books had to give!
      Sooner, he spurned it.
Image the whole, then execute the parts--
      Fancy the fabric
Quite, ere you build, ere steel strikes fire from quartz,
      Ere mortar dab brick.

(Here's the town-gate reached; there's the market-place
      Gaping before us.)
Yea, this in him was the peculiar grace
      (Hearten our chorus!)
That before living he'd learn how to live--
      No end to learning:
Earn the means first--God surely will contrive
      Use for our earning.
Others mistrust and say, "But time escapes!
      Live now or never!"
He said, "What's time? Leave Now for dogs and apes!
      Man has Forever."

Back to his book then: deeper drooped his head:
Calculus_ racked him:
Leaden before, his eyes grew dross of lead:
Tussis_ attacked him.
"Now, master, take a little rest!"--not he!
      (Caution redoubled!
Step two abreast, the way winds narrowly!)
      Not a whit troubled,
Back to his studies, fresher than at first,
      Fierce as a dragon
He (soul-hydroptic with a sacred thirst)
      Sucked at the flagon.
Oh, if we draw a circle premature,
      Heedless of far gain,
Greedy for quick returns of profit, sure
      Bad is our bargain!
Was it not great? did not he throw on God
      (He loves the burthen)--
God's task to make the heavenly period
      Perfect the earthen?
Did not he magnify the mind, show clear
      Just what it all meant?
He would not discount life, as fools do here,
      Paid by instalment.
He ventured neck or nothing--heaven's success
      Found, or earth's failure:
"Wilt thou trust death or not?" He answered "Yes!
      Hence with life's pale lure!"
That low man seeks a little thing to do,
      Sees it and does it:
This high man, with a great thing to pursue,
      Dies ere he knows it.
That low man goes on adding one to one,
      His hundred's soon hit:
This high man, aiming at a million,
      Misses an unit.
That, has the world here--should he need the next,
      Let the world mind him!
This, throws himself on God, and unperplexed
      Seeking shall find Him.
So, with the throttling hands of death at strife,
      Ground he at grammar;
Still, thro' the rattle, parts of speech were rife:
      While he could stammer
He settledHoti's_ business--let it be!--
      Properly basedOun_--
Gave as the doctrine of the encliticDe_
      Dead from the waist down.
Well, here's the platform, here's the proper place:
      Hail to your purlieus,
All ye highfliers of the feathered race,
      Swallows and curlews:
Here's the top-peak; the multitude below
      Live, for they can, there:
This man decided not to Live, but Know--
      Bury this man there?
Here--here's his place, where meteors shoot, clouds form,
      Lightnings are loosened,
Stars come and go! Let joy break with the storm,
      Peace let the dew send!
Lofty designs must close in like effects:
      Loftily lying,
Leave him--still loftier than the world suspects,
      Living and dying.
```

## To One In Paradise by Edgar Allan Poe

```
Thou wast that all to me, love,
  For which my soul did pine--
A green isle in the sea, love,
  A fountain and a shrine,
All wreathed with fairy fruits and flowers,
And all the flowers were mine.

Ah, dream too bright to last!
  Ah, starry Hope! that didst arise
But to be overcast!
  A voice from out the Future cries,
"On! on!"--but o'er the Past
  (Dim gulf!) my spirit hovering lies
Mute, motionless, aghast!

For, alas! alas! with me
  The light of Life is o'er!
"No more--no more--no more"--
(Such language holds the solemn sea
  To the sands upon the shore)
Shall bloom the thunder-blasted tree,
  Or the stricken eagle soar!

And all my days are trances,
  And all my nightly dreams
Are where thy dark eye glances,
  And where thy footstep gleams--
In what ethereal dances,
  By what eternal streams!

Alas! for that accursed time
  They bore thee o'er the billow,
From love to titled age and crime,
  And an unholy pillow!
From me, and from our misty clime,
  Where weeps the silver willow!
```

## A Bridal Song by Percy Bysshe Shelley

```
The golden gates of Sleep unbar
Where Strength and Beauty, met together,
Kindle their image like a star
In a sea of glassy weather!
Night, with all thy stars look down,--
Darkness, weep thy holiest dew,--
Never smiled the inconstant moon
On a pair so true.
Let eyes not see their own delight;--
Haste, swift Hour, and thy flight
Oft renew.

Fairies, sprites, and angels, keep her!
Holy stars, permit no wrong!
And return to wake the sleeper,
Dawn,--ere it be long!
O joy! O fear! what will be done
In the absence of the sun!
Come along!
