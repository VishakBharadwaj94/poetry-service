## The Last Ride Together by Robert Browning

```
I said--Then, dearest, since 'tis so,
Since now at length my fate I know,
Since nothing all my love avails,
Since all, my life seemed meant for, fails,
        Since this was written and needs must be--
My whole heart rises up to bless
Your name in pride and thankfulness!
Take back the hope you gave--I claim
Only a memory of the same,
--And this beside, if you will not blame,
        Your leave for one more last ride with me.

My mistress bent that brow of hers;
Those deep dark eyes where pride demurs
When pity would be softening through,
Fixed me a breathing-while or two
        With life or death in the balance: right!
The blood replenished me again;
My last thought was at least not vain:
I and my mistress, side by side
Shall be together, breathe and ride,
So, one day more am I deified.
        Who knows but the world may end tonight?

Hush! if you saw some western cloud
All billowy-bosomed, over-bowed
By many benedictions--sun's
And moon's and evening-star's at once--
        And so, you, looking and loving best,
Conscious grew, your passion drew
Cloud, sunset, moonrise, star-shine too,
Down on you, near and yet more near,
Till flesh must fade for heaven was here!--
Thus leant she and lingered--joy and fear!
        Thus lay she a moment on my breast.

Then we began to ride. My soul
Smoothed itself out, a long-cramped scroll
Freshening and fluttering in the wind.
Past hopes already lay behind.
        What need to strive with a life awry?
Had I said that, had I done this,
So might I gain, so might I miss.
Might she have loved me? just as well
She might have hated, who can tell!
Where had I been now if the worst befell?
        And here we are riding, she and I.

Fail I alone, in words and deeds?
Why, all men strive and who succeeds?
We rode; it seemed my spirit flew,
Saw other regions, cities new
        As the world rushed by on either side.
I thought,--All labour, yet no less
Bear up beneath their unsuccess
Look at the end of work, contrast
The petty done, the undone vast,
This present of theirs with the hopeful past!
        I hoped she would love me; here we ride.

What hand and brain went ever paired?
What heart alike conceived and dared?
What act proved all its thought had been?
What will but felt the fleshly screen?
        We ride and I see her bosom heave.
There's many a crown for who can reach.
Ten lines, a statesman's life in each!
The flag stuck on a heap of bones,
A soldier's doing! what atones?
They scratch his name on the Abbey-stones.
        My riding is better, by their leave.

What does it all mean, poet? Well,
Your brains beat into rhythm, you tell
What we felt only; you expressed
You hold things beautiful the best,
        And pace them in rhyme so, side by side.
'Tis something, nay 'tis much: but then,
Have you yourself what's best for men?
Are you--poor, sick, old ere your time--
Nearer one whit your own sublime
Than we who never have turned a rhyme?
        Sing, riding's a joy!  For me, I ride.

And you, great sculptor--so, you gave
A score of years to Art, her slave,
And that's your Venus, whence we turn
To yonder girl that fords the burn!
        You acquiesce, and shall I repine?
What, man of music, you grown grey
With notes and nothing else to say,
Is this your sole praise from a friend,
"Greatly his opera's strains intend,
Put in music we know how fashions end!"
        I gave my youth; but we ride, in fine.

Who knows what's fit for us? Had fate
Proposed bliss here should sublimate
My being--had I signed the bond--
Still one must lead some life beyond,
        Have a bliss to die with, dim-descried.
This foot once planted on the goal,
This glory-garland round my soul,
Could I descry such? Try and test!
I sink back shuddering from the quest.
Earth being so good, would heaven seem best?
        Now, heaven and she are beyond this ride.

And yet--she has not spoke so long!
What if heaven be that, fair and strong
At life's best, with our eyes upturned
Whither life's flower is first discerned,
        We, fixed so, ever should so abide?
What if we still ride on, we two
With life for ever old yet new,
Changed not in kind but in degree,
The instant made eternity--
And heaven just prove that I and she
        Ride, ride together, forever ride?
```

## Tie the Strings to my Life, My Lord, by Emily Dickinson

```
Tie the Strings to my Life, My Lord,
Then, I am ready to go!
Just a look at the Horses --
Rapid! That will do!

Put me in on the firmest side --
So I shall never fall --
For we must ride to the Judgment --
And it's partly, down Hill --

But never I mind the steeper --
And never I mind the Sea --
Held fast in Everlasting Race --
By my own Choice, and Thee --

Goodbye to the Life I used to live --
And the World I used to know --
And kiss the Hills, for me, just once --
Then -- I am ready to go!

## February Afternoon by Edward Thomas

```
MEN heard this roar of parleying starlings, saw,
  A thousand years ago even as now,
  Black rooks with white gulls following the plough
So that the first are last until a caw
Commands that last are first again,--a law
  Which was of old when one, like me, dreamed
    how
  A thousand years might dust lie on his brow
Yet thus would birds do between hedge and shaw.

Time swims before me, making as a day
  A thousand years, while the broad ploughland
    oak
  Roars mill-like and men strike and bear the
    stroke
    Of war as ever, audacious or resigned,
And God still sits aloft in the array
  That we have wrought him, stone-deaf and
    stone-blind.
```

### Analysis

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

In terms of form, the poem "February Afternoon" by Edward Thomas consists of a single stanza of fourteen lines. The poem follows a traditional Petrarchan sonnet structure with an octave (first eight lines) and a sestet (final six lines). The rhyme scheme in the octave is ABBAABBA, while the sestet follows a CDDCDC pattern. This structure allows for a clear division in the poem, with the octave presenting a situation or problem and the sestet offering a resolution or conclusion.

In regards to meter, the poem is written in iambic pentameter, with each line containing five pairs of syllables, alternating in stress pattern (unstressed-stressed). This regular meter gives the poem a sense of rhythm and flow, enhancing the overall musicality of the language.

### Themes and Imagery

The central themes of the poem revolve around the cyclical nature of time, the continuity of nature, and the insignificance of human existence in the grand scheme of things. The poet reflects on how the actions of birds, such as starlings, rooks, and gulls, have remained unchanged for centuries, while humans engage in the timeless pursuits of agriculture and war. This juxtaposition highlights the ephemeral nature of human life against the backdrop of eternal natural processes.

The imagery in the poem is vivid and evocative, painting a picture of a February afternoon in the countryside. The mention of "black rooks with white gulls following the plough" creates a visual contrast between the dark birds and the white gulls, symbolizing the duality of life and death. The image of "roars mill-like" oak conveys the power and strength of nature, while the reference to God as "stone-deaf and stone-blind" suggests a sense of abandonment or indifference towards human affairs.

### Literary Devices

Thomas employs several literary devices to enhance the meaning and impact of the poem. One notable device is enjambment, where lines flow into each other without a pause, creating a sense of continuity and fluidity in the poem. For example, in the lines "Time swims before me, making as a day / A thousand years," the enjambment emphasizes the fluidity of time and the merging of past and present.

The poet also uses alliteration, assonance, and consonance to create musicality and rhythm in the language. The repeated use of the "r" and "s" sounds in the lines "Roars mill-like and men strike and bear the stroke" adds a sense of sonorousness to the poem, enhancing its auditory appeal.

### Historical and Personal Context

Edward Thomas, the poet, was writing during the early 20th century, a time marked by significant social and political upheaval, including World War I. This historical context likely influenced Thomas's contemplation of themes such as war, time, and the role of nature in the face of human conflict. The poem reflects a sense of disillusionment with the state of the world and a longing for a deeper connection to the natural world.

Thomas's personal background as a nature enthusiast and a keen observer of rural life also informs the imagery and themes in the poem. His experiences in the English countryside provided him with a deep appreciation for the beauty and resilience of nature, which is evident in his lyrical descriptions of the landscape and its inhabitants.

### Deep Reading

In a deeper analysis, "February Afternoon" can be seen as a meditation on the cyclical nature of life and the transient nature of human existence. The poet contemplates the timeless activities of birds and nature, contrasting them with the fleeting actions of humans engaged in war and labor. The repetition of the phrase "a thousand years" emphasizes the vastness of time and the insignificance of individual human lives in the grand scheme of things.

The reference to God as "stone-deaf and stone-blind" suggests a questioning of divine intervention or providence in the face of human suffering and conflict. This existential inquiry adds a layer of philosophical depth to the poem, inviting readers to ponder the nature of existence and the role of humanity in the universe.

Overall, "February Afternoon" is a rich and contemplative poem that delves into timeless themes of mortality, nature, and the passage of time. Through its evocative imagery, musical language, and profound reflections, the poem invites readers to reflect on their own place in the vast tapestry of existence.
