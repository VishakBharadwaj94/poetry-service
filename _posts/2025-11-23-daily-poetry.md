## How still, how happy! by Emily Bronte

```
How still, how happy! Those are words
That once would scarce agree together;
I loved the plashing of the surge -
The changing heaven the breezy weather,

More than smooth seas and cloudless skies
And solemn, soothing, softened airs
That in the forest woke no sighs
And from the green spray shook no tears.

How still, how happy! now I feel
Where silence dwells is sweeter far
Than laughing mirth's most joyous swell
However pure its raptures are.

Come, sit down on this sunny stone:
'Tis wintry light o'er flowerless moors -
But sit - for we are all alone
And clear expand heaven's breathless shores.

I could think in the withered grass
Spring's budding wreaths we might discern;
The violet's eye might shyly flash
And young leaves shoot among the fern.

It is but thought - full many a night
The snow shall clothe those hills afar
And storms shall add a drearier blight
And winds shall wage a wilder war,

Before the lark may herald in
Fresh foliage twined with blossoms fair
And summer days again begin
Their glory - haloed crown to wear.

Yet my heart loves December's smile
As much as July's golden beam;
Then let us sit and watch the while
The blue ice curdling on the stream -
```

## A Woman's Last Word by Robert Browning

```
Let's contend no more, Love,
  Strive nor weep:
All be as before, Love,
  --Only sleep!

What so wild as words are?
  I and thou
In debate, as birds are,
  Hawk on bough!

See the creature stalking
  While we speak!
Hush and hide the talking,
  Cheek on cheek.

What so false as truth is,
  False to thee?
Where the serpent's tooth is,
  Shun the tree--

Where the apple reddens,
  Never pry--
Lest we lose our Edens,
  Eve and I.

Be a god and hold me
  With a charm!
Be a man and fold me
  With thine arm!

Teach me, only teach, Love!
  As I ought
I will speak thy speech, Love,
  Think thy thought--

Meet, if thou require it,
  Both demands,
Laying flesh and spirit
  In thy hands.

That shall be to-morrow,
  Not to-night:
I must bury sorrow
  Out of sight:

--Must a little weep, Love,
  (Foolish me!)
And so fall asleep, Love,
  Loved by thee.
```

The comparison of the couple to birds on a bough highlights the fleeting and fragile nature of their relationship, while references to the serpent's tooth and the apple symbolize temptation and the potential loss of innocence.

The poem also features biblical allusions, such as the reference to Eve and the loss of Eden, which add layers of meaning related to temptation, innocence, and consequences.

These literary devices contribute to the overall richness and complexity of the poem.

## Winter: My Secret by Christina Rossetti

```
I tell my secret? No indeed, not I:
Perhaps some day, who knows?
But not today; it froze, and blows, and snows,
And you're too curious: fie!
You want to hear it? well:
Only, my secret's mine, and I won't tell.

Or, after all, perhaps there's none:
Suppose there is no secret after all,
But only just my fun.
Today's a nipping day, a biting day;
In which one wants a shawl,
A veil, a cloak, and other wraps:
I cannot ope to every one who taps,
And let the draughts come whistling thro' my hall;
Come bounding and surrounding me,
Come buffeting, astounding me,
Nipping and clipping thro' my wraps and all.
I wear my mask for warmth: who ever shows
His nose to Russian snows
To be pecked at by every wind that blows?
You would not peck? I thank you for good will,
Believe, but leave that truth untested still.

Spring's and expansive time: yet I don't trust
March with its peck of dust,
Nor April with its rainbow-crowned brief showers,
Nor even May, whose flowers
One frost may wither thro' the sunless hours.
Perhaps some languid summer day,
When drowsy birds sing less and less,
And golden fruit is ripening to excess,
If there's not too much sun nor too much cloud,
And the warm wind is neither still nor loud,
Perhaps my secret I may say,
Or you may guess.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme
In terms of form, "Winter: My Secret" by Christina Rossetti is written in a conversational, confessional style, with the speaker directly addressing the reader. The poem consists of three stanzas, each with varying line lengths. The first stanza has five lines, the second stanza has twelve lines, and the final stanza has seven lines. There is no consistent meter throughout the poem, allowing for a natural, almost stream-of-consciousness flow to the speaker's thoughts. 

The rhyme scheme in the poem is irregular, adding to the conversational tone. For example, in the first stanza, there is an ABCCB rhyme scheme, with the rhyme between "well" and "tell" being slant rhyme. The second stanza has a more complex rhyme scheme, with internal rhymes and repetition of sounds, creating a sense of chaos and unpredictability. The final stanza returns to a more regular rhyme scheme with an AABBCCD rhyme pattern.

### Themes and Imagery
One of the central themes in the poem is the idea of secrecy and privacy. The speaker grapples with the desire to keep their secret hidden, refusing to reveal it to the reader. This theme is reinforced through the imagery of winter and cold, symbolizing the barriers and obstacles the speaker faces in sharing their secret. The harsh winter weather serves as a metaphor for the speaker's reluctance to open up and expose themselves to vulnerability.

The imagery of clothing and protection is also prevalent throughout the poem. The speaker references wearing a mask for warmth and the need for various layers to shield themselves from the cold. This imagery reflects the speaker's emotional state, highlighting their need for protection and defense against external forces.

### Literary Devices
Rossetti employs various literary devices in "Winter: My Secret" to enhance the poem's themes and imagery. The use of personification is evident in lines such as "And let the draughts come whistling thro' my hall," where the drafts are portrayed as active, intrusive forces. This personification adds depth to the portrayal of the speaker's internal struggles.

The poem also features metaphorical language, such as "March with its peck of dust," where March is compared to a bird pecking at the speaker. This metaphor underscores the speaker's lack of trust in revealing their secret during certain times of the year.

Repetition is another device used effectively in the poem, particularly in the second stanza where the speaker lists the various items of clothing they need for protection. This repetition emphasizes the speaker's sense of isolation and the barriers they have erected around themselves.

### Historical and Personal Context
Christina Rossetti was a Victorian poet known for her introspective and often melancholic poetry. As a devout Christian, Rossetti's works often explore themes of faith, love, and spirituality. In "Winter: My Secret," the theme of secrecy and the speaker's reluctance to reveal their innermost thoughts can be seen as reflective of Rossetti's own guarded nature and the societal expectations of Victorian women to maintain a certain level of decorum and restraint.

The imagery of winter and cold may also be interpreted in light of Rossetti's struggles with her health, as she suffered from various illnesses throughout her life. The harsh winter weather could symbolize both physical and emotional challenges that Rossetti faced, adding a layer of personal context to the poem.

### Deep Reading
On a deeper level, "Winter: My Secret" can be seen as a meditation on the complexities of human nature and the inherent desire for privacy and self-preservation. The speaker's refusal to divulge their secret can be interpreted as a metaphor for the ways in which individuals guard their innermost thoughts and emotions, even from those closest to them. The changing seasons and weather patterns throughout the poem serve as a metaphor for the ebb and flow of emotions and the cyclical nature of life.

The ambiguity surrounding the existence of the secret itself adds an element of mystery and intrigue to the poem, inviting readers to contemplate the nature of secrets and the power they hold over individuals. Ultimately, "Winter: My Secret" captures the universal experience of grappling with vulnerability and the tension between disclosure and concealment in human relationships.

Consider these word pairs that complement your poem's tone:

- **freedom** (Germanic) / **liberty** (Latinate)
  - *While both words convey the idea of independence and autonomy, 'freedom' has a more casual and everyday connotation, suggesting a sense of release or lack of constraint.

- **bug** (Germanic) / **insect** (Latinate)
  - *'Bug' is a simpler, colloquial term commonly used in casual conversation, while 'insect' is a more scientific and precise term.
