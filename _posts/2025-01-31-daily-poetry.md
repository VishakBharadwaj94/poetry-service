## Lines Written In Early Spring by William Wordsworth

```
I heard a thousand blended notes,
While in a grove I sate reclined,
In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts
Bring sad thoughts to the mind.

To her fair works did Nature link
The human soul that through me ran;
And much it grieved my heart to think
What man has made of man.

Through primrose tufts, in that green bower,
The periwinkle trailed its wreaths;
And 'tis my faith that every flower
Enjoys the air it breathes.

The birds around me hopped and played,
Their thoughts I cannot measure:--
But the least motion which they made
It seemed a thrill of pleasure.

The budding twigs spread out their fan,
To catch the breezy air;
And I must think, do all I can,
That there was pleasure there.

If this belief from heaven be sent,
If such be Nature's holy plan,
Have I not reason to lament
What man has made of man?
```

## A Light Woman by Robert Browning

```
So far as our story approaches the end,
   Which do you pity the most of us three?
My friend, or the mistress of my friend
   With her wanton eyes, or me?

My friend was already too good to lose,
   And seemed in the way of improvement yet,
When she crossed his path with her hunting noose
   And over him drew her net.

When I saw him tangled in her toils,
   A shame, said I, if she adds just him
To her nine-and-ninety other spoils,
   The hundredth for a whim!

And before my friend be wholly hers,
   How easy to prove to him, I said,
An eagle's the game her pride prefers,
   Though she snaps at a wren instead!

So, I gave her eyes my own eyes to take,
   My hand sought hers as in earnest need,
And round she turned for my noble sake,
   And gave me herself indeed.

The eagle am I, with my fame in the world,
   The wren is he, with his maiden face.
You look away and your lip is curled?
   Patience, a moment's space!

For see, my friend goes shaking and white;
   He eyes me as the basilisk:
I have turned, it appears, his day to night,
   Eclipsing his sun's disk.

And I did it, he thinks, as a very thief:
   "Though I love her--that, he comprehends--
One should master one's passions (love, in chief)
   And be loyal to one's friends!"

And she,--she lies in my hand as tame
   As a pear late basking over a wall;
Just a touch to try and off it came;
   'Tis mine,--can I let it fall?

With no mind to eat it, that's the worst!
   Were it thrown in the road, would the case assist?
'Twas quenching a dozen blue-flies' thirst
   When I gave its stalk a twist.

And I,--what I seem to my friend, you see:
   What I soon shall seem to his love, you guess:
What I seem to myself, do you ask of me?
   No hero, I confess.

'Tis an awkward thing to play with souls,
   And matter enough to save one's own:
Yet think of my friend, and the burning coals
   He played with for bits of stone!

One likes to show the truth for the truth;
   That the woman was light is very true:
But suppose she says,--Never mind that youth!
   What wrong have I done to you?

Well, any how, here the story stays,
   So far at least as I understand;
And, Robert Browning, you writer of plays,
   Here's a subject made to your hand!
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem consists of thirteen stanzas, each with four lines, and follows a consistent ABAB rhyme scheme. The regular rhyme scheme adds a sense of control and order to the speaker's narrative, emphasizing the calculated nature of their actions and emotions.

In terms of meter, the poem does not strictly adhere to a specific meter but flows naturally with a mix of iambic and trochaic rhythms. This variation in meter reflects the speaker's shifting emotions and internal conflict as they navigate their relationships with the friend and the mistress. The structure of the poem, with its concise stanzas and consistent rhyme scheme, allows the speaker to convey their complex feelings and moral dilemmas effectively.

### Themes and Imagery

The central themes of the poem revolve around love, friendship, betrayal, and morality. The speaker grapples with their conflicting emotions towards their friend, who is being ensnared by a manipulative mistress. The imagery of hunting and trapping is prevalent throughout the poem, symbolizing the mistress's predatory nature and the friend's vulnerability. The metaphor of the eagle and the wren represents the power dynamics between the characters, with the speaker seeing themselves as the superior figure in the relationship.

The imagery of lightness is also significant, as the title "A Light Woman" not only refers to the mistress but also hints at the superficiality and fleeting nature of relationships. The image of the pear, ripe and easily plucked, reinforces the idea of possession and control in the speaker's interactions with both the friend and the mistress. Overall, the themes and imagery in the poem highlight the complexities of human relationships and the moral dilemmas that arise from love and loyalty.

### Literary Devices

Browning employs several literary devices to enhance the emotional depth and complexity of the poem. The speaker's use of rhetorical questions, such as "Which do you pity the most of us three?" and "What wrong have I done to you?" engages the reader and invites them to consider the moral implications of the speaker's actions. The repeated use of imagery, such as the hunting noose, the eagle and the wren, and the pear, creates a vivid visual landscape that symbolizes the power dynamics and emotional entanglements between the characters.

The poem also features irony, as the speaker rationalizes their behavior while acknowledging their lack of heroism and moral righteousness. The contrast between the speaker's outward actions and their inner thoughts adds depth to their character and highlights the complexity of human nature. Browning's use of dialogue within the monologue structure allows the reader to witness the speaker's internal conflict and moral reasoning in real-time, creating a sense of immediacy and intimacy in the narrative.

### Historical and Personal Context

The poem's exploration of friendship, love triangles, and betrayal resonated with the Victorian audience's fascination with complex human relationships and moral dilemmas.

Browning's personal life, particularly his relationship with fellow poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning, may have influenced his portrayal of love and friendship in the poem. The nuanced portrayal of the speaker's conflicting emotions and moral rationalizations mirrors Browning's own struggles with love, loyalty, and personal integrity. By delving into the complexities of human nature and relationships, Browning invites the reader to reflect on their own moral compass and emotional vulnerabilities.

### Deep Reading

The speaker's self-awareness and introspection reveal a complex character torn between loyalty to their friend and desire for the mistress. The poem raises questions about the nature of human relationships, the limits of friendship, and the blurred boundaries between love and possession.

The speaker's rationalizations and justifications for their actions highlight the dualities present in human nature, where altruism and selfishness coexist within the same individual. The poem serves as a psychological study of the speaker's internal conflicts and moral struggles, inviting the reader to consider the complexities of human emotions and motivations. Ultimately, "A Light Woman" challenges the reader to confront their own moral ambiguities and ethical considerations in the context of love, friendship, and loyalty.

## Sleeping Out: Full Moon by Rupert Brooke

```
They sleep within. . . .
I cower to the earth, I waking, I only.
High and cold thou dreamest, O queen, high-dreaming and lonely.

We have slept too long, who can hardly win
The white one flame, and the night-long crying;
The viewless passers; the world's low sighing
With desire, with yearning,
To the fire unburning,
To the heatless fire, to the flameless ecstasy! . . .

Helpless I lie.
And around me the feet of thy watchers tread.
There is a rumour and a radiance of wings above my head,
An intolerable radiance of wings. . . .

All the earth grows fire,
White lips of desire
Brushing cool on the forehead, croon slumbrous things.
Earth fades; and the air is thrilled with ways,
Dewy paths full of comfort. And radiant bands,
The gracious presence of friendly hands,
Help the blind one, the glad one, who stumbles and strays,
Stretching wavering hands, up, up, through the praise
Of a myriad silver trumpets, through cries,
To all glory, to all gladness, to the infinite height,
To the gracious, the unmoving, the mother eyes,
And the laughter, and the lips, of light.
```
