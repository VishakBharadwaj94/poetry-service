Had you despised me then I must have failed,
But since I knew you trusted and believed,
I could not disappoint you and so prevailed.

## Lines Written In Early Spring by William Wordsworth

```
I heard a thousand blended notes,
While in a grove I sate reclined,
In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts
Bring sad thoughts to the mind.

To her fair works did Nature link
The human soul that through me ran;
And much it grieved my heart to think
What man has made of man.

Through primrose tufts, in that green bower,
The periwinkle trailed its wreaths;
And 'tis my faith that every flower
Enjoys the air it breathes.

The birds around me hopped and played,
Their thoughts I cannot measure:--
But the least motion which they made
It seemed a thrill of pleasure.

The budding twigs spread out their fan,
To catch the breezy air;
And I must think, do all I can,
That there was pleasure there.

If this belief from heaven be sent,
If such be Nature's holy plan,
Have I not reason to lament
What man has made of man?
```

## Peace by Rupert Brooke

```
Now, God be thanked Who has watched us with His hour,
And caught our youth, and wakened us from sleeping,
With hand made sure, clear eye, and sharpened power,
To turn, as swimmers into cleanness leaping,
Glad from a world grown old and cold and weary,
Leave the sick hearts that honour could not move,
And half-men, and their dirty songs and dreary,
And all the little emptiness of love!

Oh! we, who have known shame, we have found release there,
Where there's no ill, no grief, but sleep has mending,
Naught broken save this body, lost but breath;
Nothing to shake the laughing heart's long peace there
But only agony, and that has ending;
And the worst friend and enemy is but Death.
```

### Literary Devices

One such device is imagery, as seen in lines like "swimmers into cleanness leaping" and "laughing heart's long peace," which evoke powerful visual and emotional imagery. The use of personification is also notable, with God being thanked for "watching us with His hour" and Death being characterized as both a friend and an enemy. Additionally, the poem features alliteration in phrases like "sick hearts" and "dirty songs," creating a sense of rhythm and emphasis.

### Historical and Personal Context
