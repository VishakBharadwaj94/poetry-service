## Could Hope inspect her Basis by Emily Dickinson

```
Could Hope inspect her Basis
Her Craft were done --
Has a fictitious Charter
Or it has none --

Balked in the vastest instance
But to renew --
Felled by but one assassin --
Prosperity --
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme
The poem "Could Hope inspect her Basis" by Emily Dickinson consists of four quatrains with an ABAB rhyme scheme. Each stanza contains four lines, and the rhyme scheme creates a sense of unity and cohesion throughout the poem. The meter is irregular, with varying line lengths and stresses, giving the poem a conversational and contemplative tone. The structure of the poem is simple yet effective, allowing the reader to focus on the themes and imagery presented.

### Themes and Imagery
The central theme of the poem revolves around the concept of hope and its fragility. The speaker questions the nature of hope and its foundation, suggesting that hope may be based on something fictitious or non-existent. The imagery of hope being "felled by but one assassin -- Prosperity" evokes a sense of vulnerability and the idea that hope can easily be destroyed by external forces. The vastness of the world and the notion of renewal also play a significant role in the poem, highlighting the cyclical nature of hope and its ability to persist despite challenges.

### Literary Devices
Dickinson employs various literary devices to convey the themes of the poem. The use of personification is evident in lines such as "Could Hope inspect her Basis," where hope is given human-like qualities. The repetition of the word "but" in the third stanza emphasizes the idea of hope being easily thwarted by a single obstacle. The contrast between the vastness of the world and the individual impact of "one assassin" adds depth to the imagery and reinforces the fragility of hope.

### Historical and Personal Context
Emily Dickinson's poems often explore themes of life, death, nature, and spirituality. As a reclusive poet who led a largely solitary life, Dickinson's work reflects her personal struggles and contemplations on the human experience. This poem can be interpreted as a reflection on the fleeting nature of hope and the challenges of maintaining optimism in the face of adversity, a theme that resonates with Dickinson's own experiences of isolation and introspection.

### Deep Reading
On a deeper level, "Could Hope inspect her Basis" can be seen as a meditation on the nature of faith and resilience. The speaker's questioning of hope's foundation suggests a skepticism towards blind optimism and a desire for a more concrete understanding of what sustains hope. The mention of prosperity as the assassin of hope hints at the idea that material success can sometimes undermine the purity of hope. Ultimately, the poem invites readers to reflect on the complexities of hope and the internal and external forces that shape our beliefs and outlook on life.

## I Wandered Lonely As A Cloud by William Wordsworth

```
I wandered lonely as a cloud
That floats on high o'er vales and hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
A host, of golden daffodils;
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.

Continuous as the stars that shine
And twinkle on the milky way,
They stretched in never-ending line
Along the margin of a bay:
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.

 The waves beside them danced, but they
Out-did the sparkling leaves in glee;
A poet could not be but gay,
In such a jocund company!
I gazed—and gazed—but little thought
What wealth the show to me had brought:

For oft, when on my couch I lie
In vacant or in pensive mood,
They flash upon that inward eye
Which is the bliss of solitude;
And then my heart with pleasure fills,
And dances with the daffodils.
```

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem is the beauty and transformative power of nature. Wordsworth uses vivid imagery to depict the scene of a field of daffodils beside a lake, capturing the reader's imagination and evoking a sense of wonder and awe. The daffodils are described as a "host, of golden daffodils," "fluttering and dancing in the breeze," and "tossing their heads in sprightly dance." These images convey a sense of movement, vitality, and joy, emphasizing the beauty and vibrancy of nature.

The poem also explores the theme of memory and the power of nature to evoke feelings of joy and inspiration. Wordsworth reflects on how the memory of the daffodils brings him pleasure and fills his heart with happiness, even when he is alone or feeling melancholy.

The comparison also sets the tone for the rest of the poem, highlighting the speaker's journey of discovery and connection with nature.

Through his poetic vision, Wordsworth invites readers to see the world through a new lens and appreciate the magic and mystery of nature.

## Spring Offensive by Wilfred Owen

```
Halted against the shade of a last hill,
They fed, and, lying easy, were at ease
And, finding comfortable chests and knees
Carelessly slept.  But many there stood still
To face the stark, blank sky beyond the ridge,
Knowing their feet had come to the end of the world.

Marvelling they stood, and watched the long grass swirled
By the May breeze, murmurous with wasp and midge,
For though the summer oozed into their veins
Like the injected drug for their bones' pains,
Sharp on their souls hung the imminent line of grass,
Fearfully flashed the sky's mysterious glass.

Hour after hour they ponder the warm field --
And the far valley behind, where the buttercups
Had blessed with gold their slow boots coming up,
Where even the little brambles would not yield,
But clutched and clung to them like sorrowing hands;
They breathe like trees unstirred.

Till like a cold gust thrilled the little word
At which each body and its soul begird
And tighten them for battle.  No alarms
Of bugles, no high flags, no clamorous haste --
Only a lift and flare of eyes that faced
The sun, like a friend with whom their love is done.
O larger shone that smile against the sun, --
Mightier than his whose bounty these have spurned.

So, soon they topped the hill, and raced together
Over an open stretch of herb and heather
Exposed.  And instantly the whole sky burned
With fury against them; and soft sudden cups
Opened in thousands for their blood; and the green slopes
Chasmed and steepened sheer to infinite space.

Of them who running on that last high place
Leapt to swift unseen bullets, or went up
On the hot blast and fury of hell's upsurge,
Or plunged and fell away past this world's verge,
Some say God caught them even before they fell.

But what say such as from existence' brink
Ventured but drave too swift to sink.
The few who rushed in the body to enter hell,
And there out-fiending all its fiends and flames
With superhuman inhumanities,
Long-famous glories, immemorial shames --
And crawling slowly back, have by degrees
Regained cool peaceful air in wonder --
Why speak they not of comrades that went under?
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "Spring Offensive" by Wilfred Owen consists of three stanzas with varying line lengths and irregular rhyme schemes. The first stanza has a rhyme scheme of ABABCC, the second stanza follows a AABBCC pattern, and the final stanza has a ABCCB rhyme scheme. The irregular structure of the poem mirrors the chaotic and unpredictable nature of war, where there is no order or symmetry.

Owen's use of enjambment, where sentences and phrases continue from one line to the next without a pause, creates a sense of urgency and tension in the poem. This technique reflects the hurried and frantic pace of battle, as soldiers are constantly on the move. The lack of a regular meter also contributes to the poem's unsettling and disorienting tone, mirroring the confusion and chaos experienced by the soldiers on the battlefield.

### Themes and Imagery

The central themes of "Spring Offensive" include the brutality of war, the fleeting nature of life, and the contrast between the beauty of nature and the horrors of conflict. The poem juxtaposes the tranquility of springtime with the violence of battle, highlighting the stark contrast between the peaceful landscape and the chaos of war.

Owen uses vivid imagery throughout the poem to convey the sensory experiences of the soldiers. Descriptions of the natural world, such as "the long grass swirled," "the far valley behind, where the buttercups had blessed with gold," and "the open stretch of herb and heather," create a vivid picture of the surroundings in which the soldiers find themselves. This imagery serves to emphasize the disconnect between the beauty of the landscape and the brutality of the soldiers' actions.

### Literary Devices

Owen employs various literary devices to enhance the poem's themes and imagery. The use of personification, such as "the imminent line of grass" and "the sun, like a friend with whom their love is done," imbues the natural world with human qualities, underscoring the soldiers' emotional connections to their surroundings.

The poem also features powerful metaphors, such as "the whole sky burned with fury against them" and "soft sudden cups opened in thousands for their blood," which evoke the destructive force of war and the soldiers' vulnerability in the face of danger. Owen's use of simile, comparing the soldiers' smiles to the sun, highlights the fleeting nature of their courage and the insignificance of their actions in the grand scheme of things.

### Historical and Personal Context

Wilfred Owen was a British poet who served as a soldier in World War I, and his experiences on the front lines heavily influenced his poetry. "Spring Offensive" reflects Owen's firsthand knowledge of the horrors of war and his disillusionment with the romanticized notions of heroism and glory in battle. The poem captures the sense of futility and despair felt by soldiers who were faced with the brutal realities of combat.

Owen's choice to focus on the natural world in the midst of war reflects the Romantic tradition in literature, which celebrated the beauty of nature as a source of solace and inspiration. However, Owen's portrayal of nature as a backdrop to violence and death subverts this tradition, highlighting the stark contrast between the idealized vision of nature and the harsh realities of war.

### Deep Reading

"Spring Offensive" delves into the paradoxical nature of war, where moments of tranquility and beauty are juxtaposed with scenes of chaos and destruction. The poem's structure and imagery serve to emphasize the dissonance between the soldiers' inner thoughts and the external reality of battle. The soldiers' brief respite in nature before facing the horrors of war underscores the fleeting nature of life and the fragility of human existence.

Owen's portrayal of the soldiers as both victims and aggressors complicates traditional notions of heroism and bravery in war. The poem challenges the glorification of battle and instead highlights the senseless violence and loss that come with armed conflict. By questioning the motives and actions of soldiers in war, Owen forces readers to confront the uncomfortable truths about human nature and the destructive consequences of violence.
