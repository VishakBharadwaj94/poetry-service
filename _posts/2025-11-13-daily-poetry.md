## Sonnet 12 - Indeed this very love which is my boast by Elizabeth Barrett Browning

```
Indeed this very love which is my boast,
And which, when rising up from breast to brow,
Doth crown me with a ruby large enow
To draw men's eyes and prove the inner cost,—
This love even, all my worth, to the uttermost,
I should not love withal, unless that thou
Hadst set me an example, shown me how,
When first thine earnest eyes with mine were crossed,
And love called love. And thus, I cannot speak
Of love even, as a good thing of my own:
Thy soul hath snatched up mine all faint and weak,
And placed it by thee on a golden throne,—
And that I love (O soul, we must be meek!)
Is by thee only, whom I love alone.
```

## Vision Of The Archangels, The by Rupert Brooke

```
Slowly up silent peaks, the white edge of the world,
Trod four archangels, clear against the unheeding sky,
Bearing, with quiet even steps, and great wings furled,
A little dingy coffin; where a child must lie,
It was so tiny. (Yet, you had fancied, God could never
Have bidden a child turn from the spring and the sunlight,
And shut him in that lonely shell, to drop for ever
Into the emptiness and silence, into the night. . . .)

They then from the sheer summit cast, and watched it fall,
Through unknown glooms, that frail black coffin -- and therein
God's little pitiful Body lying, worn and thin,
And curled up like some crumpled, lonely flower-petal --
Till it was no more visible; then turned again
With sorrowful quiet faces downward to the plain.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "Vision Of The Archangels" by Rupert Brooke consists of a single stanza with ten lines. It follows a free verse form, lacking a consistent rhyme scheme or meter. The lack of rhyme and meter adds to the solemn and contemplative tone of the poem, reflecting the gravity of the subject matter being explored.

### Themes and Imagery

One of the primary themes in this poem is the juxtaposition of the divine and the human, specifically the fragility and vulnerability of human life contrasted with the power and majesty of the archangels. The image of the archangels carrying a small coffin containing a child highlights the idea of mortality and the inevitability of death. The imagery of the child being confined to the coffin and then falling into the darkness symbolizes the transition from life to death, emphasizing the transient nature of existence.

### Literary Devices

Brooke employs vivid imagery throughout the poem to evoke powerful emotions and create a sense of visual impact. The description of the archangels as "clear against the unheeding sky" and the coffin as "frail black" and "dingy" paint a stark picture of the scene. The repetition of the word "lonely" in relation to the child emphasizes the isolation and solitude of death. The comparison of the child's body to a "crumpled, lonely flower-petal" adds a poignant and delicate touch to the imagery.

### Historical and Personal Context

Rupert Brooke was writing during the early 20th century, a time marked by significant social and political upheaval, including the devastation of World War I. This context likely influenced Brooke's exploration of themes related to mortality, loss, and the fragility of life. The imagery of the child's coffin being carried by archangels may also reflect Brooke's own personal experiences or beliefs regarding death and spirituality.

### Deep Reading

The poem's title, "Vision Of The Archangels," suggests a mystical or otherworldly experience. The archangels, traditionally seen as celestial beings with great power, are portrayed here as solemn and compassionate figures, tasked with carrying the fragile body of a child to its final resting place. This portrayal highlights the idea of divine mercy and the notion that even in death, there is a sense of grace and compassion.

The poem's closing lines, with the archangels turning their faces downward to the plain in sorrow, convey a sense of empathy and mourning for the loss of the child. This moment of reflection and contemplation underscores the emotional weight of the scene and invites the reader to consider the profound impact of death on both the living and the departed.

Overall, "Vision Of The Archangels" is a poignant meditation on the themes of mortality, loss, and the enduring power of compassion in the face of death. Through its evocative imagery and emotional depth, the poem invites readers to reflect on the fragile beauty of life and the inevitability of its eventual end.

## Autumn: A Dirge by Percy Bysshe Shelley

```
The warm sun is failing, the bleak wind is wailing,
The bare boughs are sighing, the pale flowers are dying,
And the Year
On the earth her death-bed, in a shroud of leaves dead,
Is lying.
Come, Months, come away,
From November to May,
In your saddest array;
Follow the bier
Of the dead cold Year,
And like dim shadows watch by her sepulchre.

The chill rain is falling, the nipped worm is crawling,
The rivers are swelling, the thunder is knelling
For the Year;
The blithe swallows are flown, and the lizards each gone
To his dwelling;
Come, Months, come away;
Put on white, black, and gray;
Let your light sisters play--
Ye, follow the bier
Of the dead cold Year,
And make her grave green with tear on tear.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

In "Autumn: A Dirge," Percy Bysshe Shelley utilizes a consistent ABAB rhyme scheme throughout the poem, creating a sense of unity and musicality. The poem consists of three stanzas, each with a similar structure of four lines. This consistent form mirrors the cyclical nature of the seasons and the inevitable passage of time.

The meter in the poem is predominantly iambic tetrameter, with lines such as "The warm sun is failing, the bleak wind is wailing" maintaining a steady rhythm. This regular meter contributes to the elegiac tone of the poem, as the steady beat mimics the march of time and the progression towards winter and death.

### Themes and Imagery

One of the central themes of the poem is the passage of time and the inevitable cycle of life and death. Shelley uses vivid imagery to paint a picture of autumn as a time of decay and mourning. The personification of the Year as lying on her death-bed in a shroud of dead leaves evokes a sense of melancholy and finality. The imagery of bare boughs sighing, pale flowers dying, and chill rain falling creates a somber atmosphere that reflects the theme of mortality.

Another theme present in the poem is the idea of transformation and renewal. Despite the bleak imagery of death and decay, there is a sense of regeneration as the Year is laid to rest and her grave is made green with tears. This juxtaposition of death and renewal suggests that even in the darkest of times, there is hope for new beginnings.

### Literary Devices

Shelley employs various literary devices to enhance the emotional impact of the poem. The use of personification, such as giving the Year human qualities like lying on her death-bed, adds depth and emotion to the imagery. The repetition of the phrase "Come, Months, come away" throughout the poem serves as a refrain, emphasizing the cyclical nature of the seasons and the inevitability of change.

Additionally, the use of alliteration in lines like "chill rain is falling" and "nipped worm is crawling" creates a sense of rhythm and musicality that enhances the elegiac tone of the poem. The vivid imagery and sensory details also contribute to the overall mood of mourning and reflection.

### Historical and Personal Context

Written during the Romantic period, "Autumn: A Dirge" reflects the Romantic interest in nature, emotion, and the passage of time. Shelley's personal experiences, such as the deaths of loved ones and his own contemplation of mortality, likely influenced the somber tone and introspective nature of the poem. The poem also captures the Romantic fascination with the sublime, as Shelley explores the beauty and power of nature even in its most melancholic aspects.

### Deep Reading

"Autumn: A Dirge" can be seen as a meditation on the transient nature of life and the inevitability of death. Through the imagery of autumn as a time of decay and mourning, Shelley invites readers to reflect on their own mortality and the passing of time. The poem serves as a reminder of the cyclical nature of life, where death is not an end but a part of the continuous cycle of renewal and regeneration.

Ultimately, "Autumn: A Dirge" is a poignant exploration of the beauty and melancholy of the changing seasons, urging readers to embrace the impermanence of life and find solace in the ever-changing world around them.
