## Insensibility by Wilfred Owen

```
I

Happy are men who yet before they are killed
Can let their veins run cold.
Whom no compassion fleers
Or makes their feet
Sore on the alleys cobbled with their brothers.
The front line withers,
But they are troops who fade, not flowers
For poets' tearful fooling:
Men, gaps for filling
Losses who might have fought
Longer; but no one bothers.


    II

And some cease feeling
Even themselves or for themselves.
Dullness best solves
The tease and doubt of shelling,
And Chance's strange arithmetic
Comes simpler than the reckoning of their shilling.
They keep no check on Armies' decimation.


    III

Happy are these who lose imagination:
They have enough to carry with ammunition.
Their spirit drags no pack.
Their old wounds save with cold can not more ache.
Having seen all things red,
Their eyes are rid
Of the hurt of the colour of blood for ever.
And terror's first constriction over,
Their hearts remain small drawn.
Their senses in some scorching cautery of battle
Now long since ironed,
Can laugh among the dying, unconcerned.


    IV

Happy the soldier home, with not a notion
How somewhere, every dawn, some men attack,
And many sighs are drained.
Happy the lad whose mind was never trained:
His days are worth forgetting more than not.
He sings along the march
Which we march taciturn, because of dusk,
The long, forlorn, relentless trend
From larger day to huger night.


    V

We wise, who with a thought besmirch
Blood over all our soul,
How should we see our task
But through his blunt and lashless eyes?
Alive, he is not vital overmuch;
Dying, not mortal overmuch;
Nor sad, nor proud,
Nor curious at all.
He cannot tell
Old men's placidity from his.


    VI

But cursed are dullards whom no cannon stuns,
That they should be as stones.
Wretched are they, and mean
With paucity that never was simplicity.
By choice they made themselves immune
To pity and whatever mourns in man
Before the last sea and the hapless stars;
Whatever mourns when many leave these shores;
Whatever shares
The eternal reciprocity of tears.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

Wilfred Owen's poem "Insensibility" is written in six stanzas, each with varying line lengths. The poem does not adhere to a specific rhyme scheme, which mirrors the chaotic and disordered nature of war that the poem discusses. The lack of rhyme scheme also adds to the overall sense of bleakness and despair present in the poem. 

The irregular structure of the poem reflects the fragmented and disjointed experiences of soldiers in war. The lack of a consistent meter also contributes to the sense of disorientation and confusion that the soldiers face in battle. The enjambment used throughout the poem further emphasizes the continuous and relentless nature of war, with lines flowing seamlessly into each other without pause.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of "Insensibility" is the psychological impact of war on soldiers. Owen explores the idea of insensitivity as a coping mechanism for the horrors of war. The poem delves into how soldiers detach themselves emotionally to survive the brutality and trauma they face on the battlefield. The imagery Owen uses, such as "All things red" and "The hurt of the colour of blood," vividly conveys the physical and emotional toll of war on individuals.

The poem also touches on the themes of disillusionment, loss of innocence, and the dehumanizing effects of war. Owen portrays a bleak and stark reality where soldiers are stripped of their humanity and reduced to mere numbers on a battlefield. The imagery of "dullness best solves" and "their hearts remain small drawn" highlights the emotional numbness that soldiers experience as a result of their exposure to violence and death.

### Literary Devices

Owen employs various literary devices to convey the harsh realities of war in "Insensibility." One prominent device is irony, as the title "Insensibility" suggests a lack of sensitivity or feeling, yet the poem explores the emotional toll that war exacts on individuals. The use of paradox, such as "Happy are these who lose imagination," underscores the contradictory nature of finding happiness in the loss of one's ability to empathize or feel.

The poem also features vivid imagery, such as "Their old wounds save with cold can not more ache," which evokes a sense of physical and emotional numbness. The repetition of the word "Happy" throughout the poem serves as a stark contrast to the bleak subject matter, emphasizing the grim reality of war.

### Historical and Personal Context

Wilfred Owen, a soldier in World War I, wrote "Insensibility" during a time of great upheaval and devastation. The poem reflects Owen's own experiences on the front lines and his observations of the psychological toll that warfare takes on individuals. Owen's firsthand knowledge of war lends authenticity and depth to his portrayal of the dehumanizing effects of combat.

The context of World War I, known for its unprecedented levels of violence and destruction, further informs the themes of disillusionment, trauma, and emotional detachment present in the poem. Owen's poignant portrayal of the psychological scars left by war resonates with the experiences of countless soldiers who endured the horrors of battle during this tumultuous period in history.

### Deep Reading

"Insensibility" is a powerful and poignant exploration of the emotional and psychological impact of war on individuals. Owen's use of vivid imagery, irony, and paradox effectively conveys the dehumanizing effects of combat and the ways in which soldiers cope with the traumas they face. The poem challenges conventional notions of heroism and sacrifice, instead offering a stark and unflinching portrayal of the brutal realities of war.

Through his evocative language and poignant reflections, Owen invites readers to confront the harsh truths of warfare and to consider the profound toll it takes on those who experience it firsthand. "Insensibility" serves as a haunting reminder of the lasting scars left by war and the complex ways in which individuals navigate the horrors of conflict in order to survive.

## Confessions by Robert Browning

```
What is he buzzing in my ears?
  "Now that I come to die,
Do I view the world as a vale of tears?"
  Ah, reverend sir, not I!

What I viewed there once, what I view again
  Where the physic bottles stand
On the table's edge,--is a suburb lane,
  With a wall to my bedside hand.

That lane sloped, much as the bottles do,
  From a house you could descry
O'er the garden-wall: is the curtain blue
  Or green to a healthy eye?

To mine, it serves for the old June weather
  Blue above lane and wall;
And that farthest bottle labelled "Ether"
  Is the house o'er-topping all.

At a terrace, somewhere near the stopper,
  There watched for me, one June,
A girl: I know, sir, it's improper,
  My poor mind's out of tune.

Only, there was a way ... you crept
  Close by the side, to dodge
Eyes in the house, two eyes except:
  They styled their house "The Lodge."

What right had a lounger up their lane?
  But, by creeping very close,
With the good wall's help,--their eyes might strain
  And stretch themselves to Oes,

Yet never catch her and me together,
  As she left the attic, there,
By the rim of the bottle labelled "Ether,"
  And stole from stair to stair

And stood by the rose-wreathed gate. Alas,
  We loved, sir--used to meet;
How sad and bad and mad it was--
  But then, how it was sweet!
```

## Spirits Of The Dead by Edgar Allan Poe

```
Thy soul shall find itself alone
'Mid dark thoughts of the gray tombstone
Not one, of all the crowd, to pry
Into thine hour of secrecy.
Be silent in that solitude
  Which is not loneliness--for then
The spirits of the dead who stood
  In life before thee are again
In death around thee--and their will
Shall overshadow thee: be still.
The night--tho' clear--shall frown--
And the stars shall not look down
From their high thrones in the Heaven,
With light like Hope to mortals given--
But their red orbs, without beam,
To thy weariness shall seem
As a burning and a fever
Which would cling to thee forever.
Now are thoughts thou shalt not banish--
Now are visions ne'er to vanish--
From thy spirit shall they pass
No more--like dew-drops from the grass.
The breeze--the breath of God--is still--
And the mist upon the hill
Shadowy--shadowy--yet unbroken,
  Is a symbol and a token--
  How it hangs upon the trees,
  A mystery of mysteries!
```
