## Bright Clouds by Edward Thomas

```
BRIGHT clouds of may
Shade half the pond.
Beyond,
All but one bay
Of emerald
Tall reeds
Like criss-cross bayonets
Where a bird once called,
Lies bright as the sun.
No one heeds.
The light wind frets
And drifts the scum
Of may-blossom.
Till the moorhen calls
Again
Naught's to be done
By birds or men.
Still the may falls.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "Bright Clouds" by Edward Thomas is composed of a single stanza with fifteen lines. The structure is free verse, lacking a consistent rhyme scheme or meter. This lack of formal structure mirrors the natural and uncontrolled elements depicted in the poem, such as the wind fretting and drifting the may-blossom scum. The irregularity in form reflects the unpredictability and transience of nature.

### Themes and Imagery

The central themes of the poem revolve around nature, transience, and the passing of time. The imagery of "Bright clouds of may" and "Shade half the pond" sets a serene and ephemeral tone. The may-blossom symbolizes the fleeting beauty of spring, as it falls and drifts away with the wind. The pond, reeds, and moorhen evoke a sense of peaceful yet melancholic natural setting, highlighting the cycle of life and death.

### Literary Devices

Thomas employs several literary devices throughout the poem. The imagery of "Tall reeds / Like criss-cross bayonets" creates a vivid visual comparison, adding depth to the scene. The personification of the wind as it "frets" and "drifts" the may-blossom enhances the sense of movement and restlessness in nature. The repetition of the word "bright" emphasizes the luminosity and fleeting nature of the scene, drawing attention to the transient beauty of the moment.

### Historical and Personal Context

Edward Thomas was a British poet who often drew inspiration from nature and the English countryside. His poems frequently explore themes of loss, nostalgia, and the passage of time. "Bright Clouds" reflects Thomas's deep connection to the natural world and his contemplation of mortality and impermanence. Written during a tumultuous period in history, the poem may also symbolize the fragility of peace and the inevitability of change.

### Deep Reading

On a deeper level, "Bright Clouds" can be interpreted as a meditation on the fleeting nature of beauty and the inevitability of decay. The juxtaposition of the bright clouds and the falling may-blossom conveys a sense of contrast between vitality and transience. The lack of resolution in the final lines, "Naught's to be done / By birds or men. / Still the may falls," suggests a resigned acceptance of the cyclical nature of life and the futility of trying to hold onto fleeting moments. Ultimately, the poem serves as a poignant reminder of the impermanence of all things, urging readers to appreciate the beauty of the present moment before it too fades away.

## War by Percy Bysshe Shelley

```
Ambition, power, and avarice, now have hurled
Death, fate, and ruin, on a bleeding world.
See! on yon heath what countless victims lie,
Hark! what loud shrieks ascend through yonder sky;
Tell then the cause, 'tis sure the avenger's rage
Has swept these myriads from life's crowded stage:
Hark to that groan, an anguished hero dies,
He shudders in death's latest agonies;
Yet does a fleeting hectic flush his cheek,
Yet does his parting breath essay to speak--
'Oh God! my wife, my children--Monarch thou
For whose support this fainting frame lies low;
For whose support in distant lands I bleed,
Let his friends' welfare be the warrior's meed.
He hears me not--ah! no--kings cannot hear,
For passion's voice has dulled their listless ear.
To thee, then, mighty God, I lift my moan,
Thou wilt not scorn a suppliant's anguished groan.
Oh! now I die--but still is death's fierce pain--
God hears my prayer--we meet, we meet again.'
He spake, reclined him on death's bloody bed,
And with a parting groan his spirit fled.
Oppressors of mankind to YOU we owe
The baleful streams from whence these miseries flow;
For you how many a mother weeps her son,
Snatched from life's course ere half his race was run!
For you how many a widow drops a tear,
In silent anguish, on her husband's bier!
'Is it then Thine, Almighty Power,' she cries,
'Whence tears of endless sorrow dim these eyes?
Is this the system which Thy powerful sway,
Which else in shapeless chaos sleeping lay,
Formed and approved?--it cannot be--but oh!
Forgive me, Heaven, my brain is warped by woe.'
'Tis not--He never bade the war-note swell,
He never triumphed in the work of hell--
Monarchs of earth! thine is the baleful deed,
Thine are the crimes for which thy subjects bleed.
Ah! when will come the sacred fated time,
When man unsullied by his leaders' crime,
Despising wealth, ambition, pomp, and pride,
Will stretch him fearless by his foe-men's side?
Ah! when will come the time, when o'er the plain
No more shall death and desolation reign?
When will the sun smile on the bloodless field,
And the stern warrior's arm the sickle wield?
Not whilst some King, in cold ambition's dreams,
Plans for the field of death his plodding schemes;
Not whilst for private pique the public fall,
And one frail mortal's mandate governs all.
Swelled with command and mad with dizzying sway;
Who sees unmoved his myriads fade away.
Careless who lives or dies--so that he gains
Some trivial point for which he took the pains.
What then are Kings?--I see the trembling crowd,
I hear their fulsome clamours echoed loud;
Their stern oppressor pleased appears awhile,
But April's sunshine is a Monarch's smile--
Kings are but dust--the last eventful day
Will level all and make them lose their sway;
Will dash the sceptre from the Monarch's hand,
And from the warrior's grasp wrest the ensanguined brand.
Oh! Peace, soft Peace, art thou for ever gone,
Is thy fair form indeed for ever flown?
And love and concord hast thou swept away,
As if incongruous with thy parted sway?
Alas, I fear thou hast, for none appear.
Now o'er the palsied earth stalks giant Fear,
With War, and Woe, and Terror, in his train;--
List'ning he pauses on the embattled plain,
Then speeding swiftly o'er the ensanguined heath,
Has left the frightful work to Hell and Death.
See! gory Ruin yokes his blood-stained car,
He scents the battle's carnage from afar;
Hell and Destruction mark his mad career,
He tracks the rapid step of hurrying Fear;
Whilst ruined towns and smoking cities tell,
That thy work, Monarch, is the work of Hell.
'It is thy work!' I hear a voice repeat,
Shakes the broad basis of thy bloodstained seat;
And at the orphan's sigh, the widow's moan,
Totters the fabric of thy guilt-stained throne--
'It is thy work, O Monarch;' now the sound
Fainter and fainter, yet is borne around,
Yet to enthusiast ears the murmurs tell
That Heaven, indignant at the work of Hell,
Will soon the cause, the hated cause remove,
Which tears from earth peace, innocence, and love.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

This lack of formal structure mirrors the chaotic and destructive nature of war that the poem explores. The poem consists of four stanzas, each varying in length, which adds to the feeling of disarray and turmoil conveyed in the verses. The irregular line lengths also contribute to the sense of unpredictability and violence associated with war.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of "War" is the devastating impact of conflict on humanity. Shelley vividly describes the horrors of war through powerful imagery, such as "on yon heath what countless victims lie" and "gory Ruin yokes his blood-stained car." The poem evokes a sense of despair and loss, highlighting the suffering of individuals caught in the crossfire of ambition and power struggles. The imagery of death, destruction, and suffering serves to emphasize the futility and senselessness of war.

### Literary Devices

Shelley employs various literary devices to enhance the emotional impact of the poem. One notable device is personification, as seen in lines like "Death, fate, and ruin, on a bleeding world" and "Peace, soft Peace, art thou for ever gone." Personifying abstract concepts like death and peace adds a sense of urgency and drama to the verses. Additionally, the use of alliteration in phrases like "bleeding world" and "gory Ruin" helps to create a sense of rhythm and emphasis in the poem.

### Historical and Personal Context

Written during a time of political unrest and upheaval in Europe, Shelley's poem reflects his own revolutionary ideals and opposition to oppressive rulers. The references to monarchs and oppressors in the poem can be interpreted as a critique of the authoritarian regimes that perpetuate war and suffering.

### Deep Reading

Through "War," Shelley presents a scathing critique of the power dynamics that drive conflict and perpetuate human suffering. The poem condemns the egotism and callousness of leaders who prioritize their own ambitions over the well-being of their people. By portraying war as a destructive force that erodes peace, innocence, and love, Shelley calls for a reevaluation of societal values and a rejection of violence as a means of resolving disputes. Ultimately, "War" serves as a powerful plea for compassion, empathy, and a collective effort to end the cycle of destruction that war inflicts on humanity.

## Insensibility by Wilfred Owen

```
I

Happy are men who yet before they are killed
Can let their veins run cold.
Whom no compassion fleers
Or makes their feet
Sore on the alleys cobbled with their brothers.
The front line withers,
But they are troops who fade, not flowers
For poets' tearful fooling:
Men, gaps for filling
Losses who might have fought
Longer; but no one bothers.


    II

And some cease feeling
Even themselves or for themselves.
Dullness best solves
The tease and doubt of shelling,
And Chance's strange arithmetic
Comes simpler than the reckoning of their shilling.
They keep no check on Armies' decimation.


    III

Happy are these who lose imagination:
They have enough to carry with ammunition.
Their spirit drags no pack.
Their old wounds save with cold can not more ache.
Having seen all things red,
Their eyes are rid
Of the hurt of the colour of blood for ever.
And terror's first constriction over,
Their hearts remain small drawn.
Their senses in some scorching cautery of battle
Now long since ironed,
Can laugh among the dying, unconcerned.


    IV

Happy the soldier home, with not a notion
How somewhere, every dawn, some men attack,
And many sighs are drained.
Happy the lad whose mind was never trained:
His days are worth forgetting more than not.
He sings along the march
Which we march taciturn, because of dusk,
The long, forlorn, relentless trend
From larger day to huger night.


    V

We wise, who with a thought besmirch
Blood over all our soul,
How should we see our task
But through his blunt and lashless eyes?
Alive, he is not vital overmuch;
Dying, not mortal overmuch;
Nor sad, nor proud,
Nor curious at all.
He cannot tell
Old men's placidity from his.


    VI

But cursed are dullards whom no cannon stuns,
That they should be as stones.
Wretched are they, and mean
With paucity that never was simplicity.
By choice they made themselves immune
To pity and whatever mourns in man
Before the last sea and the hapless stars;
Whatever mourns when many leave these shores;
Whatever shares
The eternal reciprocity of tears.
```
