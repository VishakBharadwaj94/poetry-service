## From “Later Life” by Christina Rossetti

```
VI
We lack, yet cannot fix upon the lack:
Not this, nor that; yet somewhat, certainly.
We see the things we do not yearn to see
Around us: and what see we glancing back?
Lost hopes that leave our hearts upon the rack,
Hopes that were never ours yet seem’d to be,
For which we steer’d on life’s salt stormy sea
Braving the sunstroke and the frozen pack.
If thus to look behind is all in vain,
And all in vain to look to left or right,
Why face we not our future once again,
Launching with hardier hearts across the main,
Straining dim eyes to catch the invisible sight,
And strong to bear ourselves in patient pain?

IX
Star Sirius and the Pole Star dwell afar
Beyond the drawings each of other’s strength:
One blazes through the brief bright summer’s length
Lavishing life-heat from a flaming car;
While one unchangeable upon a throne
Broods o’er the frozen heart of earth alone,
Content to reign the bright particular star
Of some who wander or of some who groan.
They own no drawings each of other’s strength,
Nor vibrate in a visible sympathy,
Nor veer along their courses each toward
Yet are their orbits pitch’d in harmony
Of one dear heaven, across whose depth and length
Mayhap they talk together without speech.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

In terms of form, both poems are structured as sonnets, with fourteen lines each. The rhyme scheme in both poems is ABBAABBA CDCDCD. This traditional Petrarchan sonnet form allows for a clear division of the poems into an octave and a sestet, with a volta or shift in tone or argument typically occurring between the two sections.

The meter in these poems is predominantly iambic pentameter, with five metrical feet per line, following a pattern of unstressed syllables followed by stressed syllables. This regular meter helps to create a sense of rhythm and flow in the poems.

### Themes and Imagery

One of the central themes in these poems is the passage of time and the reflection on one's past, present, and future. In "Later Life," Rossetti explores the idea of looking back on lost hopes and missed opportunities while also contemplating the possibility of facing the future with renewed courage and perseverance.

The imagery in these poems is rich and evocative, with vivid descriptions of celestial bodies like Sirius and the Pole Star used as metaphors for different aspects of life. The contrast between the blazing heat of Sirius and the steadfastness of the Pole Star reflects the dual nature of human experience - the fleeting moments of passion and intensity juxtaposed with the enduring constancy of certain truths.

### Literary Devices

Rossetti employs various literary devices in these poems to enhance their meaning and impact. In "Later Life," the use of paradox in lines like "We lack, yet cannot fix upon the lack" (VI) and "If thus to look behind is all in vain" (VI) creates a sense of ambiguity and uncertainty, highlighting the speaker's struggle to make sense of their emotions and experiences.

The use of imagery, such as the metaphor of sailing on a stormy sea in "braving the sunstroke and the frozen pack" (VI), adds depth and complexity to the poems, inviting readers to engage with the symbolic meanings embedded in the text.

### Historical and Personal Context

Christina Rossetti was a Victorian poet known for her introspective and deeply spiritual poetry. As a woman living in the 19th century, Rossetti faced societal expectations and limitations that influenced her writing. Themes of longing, loss, and the passage of time are recurrent in her work, reflecting the personal struggles and experiences that shaped her worldview.

The historical context of the Victorian era, with its emphasis on propriety, morality, and social norms, informs Rossetti's exploration of themes like love, faith, and mortality in her poetry. The tension between tradition and innovation, stability and change, is reflected in the thematic concerns of these poems.

### Deep Reading

In these poems, Rossetti grapples with the complexities of human experience, exploring the contradictions and paradoxes inherent in life. The speaker's contemplation of lost hopes and missed opportunities in "Later Life" reflects a universal struggle to come to terms with the past while also embracing the future with hope and resilience.

The juxtaposition of the two celestial bodies in "Star Sirius and the Pole Star" serves as a powerful metaphor for the dualities of human existence - the fleeting moments of passion and intensity contrasted with the enduring truths that anchor us in times of uncertainty and change.

Overall, these poems invite readers to reflect on the transient nature of life, the inevitability of change, and the enduring power of hope and resilience in the face of adversity. Rossetti's introspective and contemplative voice resonates across time, offering insight and solace to readers grappling with their own journeys through life.

## Spring Offensive by Wilfred Owen

```
Halted against the shade of a last hill,
They fed, and, lying easy, were at ease
And, finding comfortable chests and knees
Carelessly slept.  But many there stood still
To face the stark, blank sky beyond the ridge,
Knowing their feet had come to the end of the world.

Marvelling they stood, and watched the long grass swirled
By the May breeze, murmurous with wasp and midge,
For though the summer oozed into their veins
Like the injected drug for their bones' pains,
Sharp on their souls hung the imminent line of grass,
Fearfully flashed the sky's mysterious glass.

Hour after hour they ponder the warm field --
And the far valley behind, where the buttercups
Had blessed with gold their slow boots coming up,
Where even the little brambles would not yield,
But clutched and clung to them like sorrowing hands;
They breathe like trees unstirred.

Till like a cold gust thrilled the little word
At which each body and its soul begird
And tighten them for battle.  No alarms
Of bugles, no high flags, no clamorous haste --
Only a lift and flare of eyes that faced
The sun, like a friend with whom their love is done.
O larger shone that smile against the sun, --
Mightier than his whose bounty these have spurned.

So, soon they topped the hill, and raced together
Over an open stretch of herb and heather
Exposed.  And instantly the whole sky burned
With fury against them; and soft sudden cups
Opened in thousands for their blood; and the green slopes
Chasmed and steepened sheer to infinite space.

Of them who running on that last high place
Leapt to swift unseen bullets, or went up
On the hot blast and fury of hell's upsurge,
Or plunged and fell away past this world's verge,
Some say God caught them even before they fell.

But what say such as from existence' brink
Ventured but drave too swift to sink.
The few who rushed in the body to enter hell,
And there out-fiending all its fiends and flames
With superhuman inhumanities,
Long-famous glories, immemorial shames --
And crawling slowly back, have by degrees
Regained cool peaceful air in wonder --
Why speak they not of comrades that went under?
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "Spring Offensive" by Wilfred Owen consists of four stanzas with varying line lengths, creating a sense of movement and progression as the soldiers described in the poem move towards their inevitable fate. The irregular structure mirrors the chaotic and unpredictable nature of war. The poem does not follow a specific rhyme scheme, emphasizing the disjointed and harsh realities of battle. Owen's use of enjambment, where sentences and phrases continue from one line to the next without punctuation, adds to the sense of urgency and tension in the poem. The lack of strict meter allows for a more natural and conversational tone, enhancing the emotional impact of the poem.

### Themes and Imagery

One of the central themes of the poem is the juxtaposition of the beauty of nature with the brutality of war. Owen vividly describes the soldiers enjoying a moment of peace and tranquility in the midst of nature before being thrust into the chaos and violence of battle. The imagery of the soldiers marveling at the natural world around them, only to be confronted by the harsh reality of war, highlights the stark contrast between innocence and experience. The use of natural imagery such as grass, breeze, and flowers serves as a poignant reminder of the fleeting beauty of life in the face of death.

### Literary Devices

Owen employs various literary devices to convey the horrors of war and the emotions of the soldiers. One notable device is personification, where nature is given human qualities, such as the grass "knowing" and the sky's reflection being described as "mysterious glass." This personification adds depth to the imagery and emphasizes the soldiers' connection to their surroundings. Owen also uses similes and metaphors to evoke strong emotions, such as comparing the soldiers' fear to a "line of grass" and the sky to a "friend with whom their love is done." These comparisons create vivid and evocative images that resonate with the reader.

### Historical and Personal Context

Wilfred Owen was a British poet who served in World War I and wrote extensively about the horrors of the conflict. "Spring Offensive" was written during Owen's time in the trenches, where he witnessed firsthand the devastation and loss caused by war. The poem reflects Owen's disillusionment with the glorification of war and his condemnation of the senseless violence that it entails. By depicting the soldiers' inner turmoil and fear in the face of battle, Owen sheds light on the psychological toll of war on the individuals who are forced to endure it.

### Deep Reading

"Spring Offensive" delves into the complex emotions and experiences of soldiers facing the harsh realities of war. The poem explores themes of innocence, loss, and the futility of conflict, capturing the internal struggles of individuals caught up in the chaos of battle. Through vivid imagery and powerful language, Owen invites readers to confront the brutality of war and the profound impact it has on those who are thrust into its midst. Ultimately, "Spring Offensive" serves as a poignant reminder of the human cost of war and the enduring trauma that it leaves in its wake.

## Strayed Reveller, The by Matthew Arnold

```
The Youth

Faster, faster,
O Circe, Goddess,
Let the wild, thronging train
The bright procession
Of eddying forms,
Sweep through my soul!
Thou standest, smiling
Down on me! thy right arm,
Lean'd up against the column there,
Props thy soft cheek;
Thy left holds, hanging loosely,
The deep cup, ivy-cinctured,
I held but now.
Is it, then, evening
So soon? I see, the night-dews,
Cluster'd in thick beads, dim
The agate brooch-stones
On thy white shoulder;
The cool night-wind, too,
Blows through the portico,
Stirs thy hair, Goddess,
Waves thy white robe!


Circe.

Whence art thou, sleeper?


The Youth.

When the white dawn first
Through the rough fir-planks
Of my hut, by the chestnuts,
Up at the valley-head,
Came breaking, Goddess!
I sprang up, I threw round me
My dappled fawn-skin;
Passing out, from the wet turf,
Where they lay, by the hut door,
I snatch'd up my vine-crown, my fir-staff,
All drench'd in dew-
Came swift down to join
The rout early gather'd
In the town, round the temple,
Iacchus' white fane
On yonder hill.
Quick I pass'd, following
The wood-cutters' cart-track
Down the dark valley;-I saw
On my left, through the beeches,
Thy palace, Goddess,
Smokeless, empty!
Trembling, I enter'd; beheld
The court all silent,
The lions sleeping,
On the altar this bowl.
I drank, Goddess!
And sank down here, sleeping,
On the steps of thy portico.


Circe.

Foolish boy! Why tremblest thou?
Thou lovest it, then, my wine?
Wouldst more of it? See, how glows,
Through the delicate, flush'd marble,
The red, creaming liquor,
Strown with dark seeds!
Drink, thee! I chide thee not,
Deny thee not my bowl.
Come, stretch forth thy hand, thee-so!
Drink-drink again!


The Youth.

Thanks, gracious one!
Ah, the sweet fumes again!
More soft, ah me,
More subtle-winding
Than Pan's flute-music!
Faint-faint! Ah me,
Again the sweet sleep!


Circe.

Hist! Thou-within there!
Come forth, Ulysses!
Art tired with hunting?
While we range the woodland,
See what the day brings.


Ulysses.

Ever new magic!
Hast thou then lured hither,
Wonderful Goddess, by thy art,
The young, languid-eyed Ampelus,
Iacchus' darling-
Or some youth beloved of Pan,
Of Pan and the Nymphs?
That he sits, bending downward
His white, delicate neck
To the ivy-wreathed marge
Of thy cup; the bright, glancing vine-leaves
That crown his hair,
Falling forward, mingling
With the dark ivy-plants--
His fawn-skin, half untied,
Smear'd with red wine-stains? Who is he,
That he sits, overweigh'd
By fumes of wine and sleep,
So late, in thy portico?
What youth, Goddess,-what guest
Of Gods or mortals?


Circe.

Hist! he wakes!
I lured him not hither, Ulysses.
Nay, ask him!


The Youth.

Who speaks' Ah, who comes forth
To thy side, Goddess, from within?
How shall I name him?
This spare, dark-featured,
Quick-eyed stranger?
Ah, and I see too
His sailor's bonnet,
His short coat, travel-tarnish'd,
With one arm bare!--
Art thou not he, whom fame
This long time rumours
The favour'd guest of Circe, brought by the waves?
Art thou he, stranger?
The wise Ulysses,
Laertes' son?


Ulysses.

I am Ulysses.
And thou, too, sleeper?
Thy voice is sweet.
It may be thou hast follow'd
Through the islands some divine bard,
By age taught many things,
Age and the Muses;
And heard him delighting
The chiefs and people
In the banquet, and learn'd his songs.
Of Gods and Heroes,
Of war and arts,
And peopled cities,
Inland, or built
By the gray sea.-If so, then hail!
I honour and welcome thee.


The Youth.

The Gods are happy.
They turn on all sides
Their shining eyes,
And see below them
The earth and men.
They see Tiresias
Sitting, staff in hand,
On the warm, grassy
Asopus bank,
His robe drawn over
His old sightless head,
Revolving inly
The doom of Thebes.
They see the Centaurs
In the upper glens
Of Pelion, in the streams,
Where red-berried ashes fringe
The clear-brown shallow pools,
With streaming flanks, and heads
Rear'd proudly, snuffing
The mountain wind.
They see the Indian
Drifting, knife in hand,
His frail boat moor'd to
A floating isle thick-matted
With large-leaved, low-creeping melon-plants
And the dark cucumber.
He reaps, and stows them,
Drifting--drifting;--round him,
Round his green harvest-plot,
Flow the cool lake-waves,
The mountains ring them.
They see the Scythian
On the wide stepp, unharnessing
His wheel'd house at noon.
He tethers his beast down, and makes his meal--
Mares' milk, and bread
Baked on the embers;--all around
The boundless, waving grass-plains stretch, thick-starr'd
With saffron and the yellow hollyhock
And flag-leaved iris-flowers.
Sitting in his cart
He makes his meal; before him, for long miles,
Alive with bright green lizards,
And the springing bustard-fowl,
The track, a straight black line,
Furrows the rich soil; here and there
Cluster of lonely mounds
Topp'd with rough-hewn,
Gray, rain-blear'd statues, overpeer
The sunny waste.
They see the ferry
On the broad, clay-laden
Lone Chorasmian stream;--thereon,
With snort and strain,
Two horses, strongly swimming, tow
The ferry-boat, with woven ropes
To either bow
Firm harness'd by the mane; a chief
With shout and shaken spear,
Stands at the prow, and guides them; but astern
The cowering merchants, in long robes,
Sit pale beside their wealth
Of silk-bales and of balsam-drops,
Of gold and ivory,
Of turquoise-earth and amethyst,
Jasper and chalcedony,
And milk-barred onyx-stones.
The loaded boat swings groaning
In the yellow eddies;
The Gods behold him.
They see the Heroes
Sitting in the dark ship
On the foamless, long-heaving
Violet sea.
At sunset nearing
The Happy Islands.
These things, Ulysses,
The wise bards, also
Behold and sing.
But oh, what labour!
O prince, what pain!
They too can see
Tiresias;--but the Gods,
Who give them vision,
Added this law:
That they should bear too
His groping blindness,
His dark foreboding,
His scorn'd white hairs;
Bear Hera's anger
Through a life lengthen'd
To seven ages.
They see the Centaurs
On Pelion:--then they feel,
They too, the maddening wine
Swell their large veins to bursting; in wild pain
They feel the biting spears
Of the grim Lapithж, and Theseus, drive,
Drive crashing through their bones; they feel
High on a jutting rock in the red stream
Alcmena's dreadful son
Ply his bow;--such a price
The Gods exact for song:
To become what we sing.
They see the Indian
On his mountain lake; but squalls
Make their skiff reel, and worms
In the unkind spring have gnawn
Their melon-harvest to the heart.--They see
The Scythian: but long frosts
Parch them in winter-time on the bare stepp,
Till they too fade like grass; they crawl
Like shadows forth in spring.
They see the merchants
On the Oxus stream;--but care
Must visit first them too, and make them pale.
Whether, through whirling sand,
A cloud of desert robber-horse have burst
Upon their caravan; or greedy kings,
In the wall'd cities the way passes through,
Crush'd them with tolls; or fever-airs,
On some great river's marge,
Mown them down, far from home.
They see the Heroes
Near harbour;--but they share
Their lives, and former violent toil in Thebes,
Seven-gated Thebes, or Troy;
Or where the echoing oars
Of Argo first
Startled the unknown sea.
The old Silenus
Came, lolling in the sunshine,
From the dewy forest-coverts,
This way at noon.
Sitting by me, while his Fauns
Down at the water-side
Sprinkled and smoothed
His drooping garland,
He told me these things.
But I, Ulysses,
Sitting on the warm steps,
Looking over the valley,
All day long, have seen,
Without pain, without labour,
Sometimes a wild-hair'd Mжnad--
Sometimes a Faun with torches--
And sometimes, for a moment,
Passing through the dark stems
Flowing-robed, the beloved,
The desired, the divine,
Beloved Iacchus.
Ah, cool night-wind, tremulous stars!
Ah, glimmering water,
Fitful earth-murmur,
Dreaming woods!
Ah, golden-haired, strangely smiling Goddess,
And thou, proved, much enduring,
Wave-toss'd Wanderer!
Who can stand still?
Ye fade, ye swim, ye waver before me--
The cup again!
Faster, faster,
O Circe, Goddess.
Let the wild, thronging train,
The bright procession
Of eddying forms,
Sweep through my soul!
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

In terms of form, "The Strayed Reveller" by Matthew Arnold is a dramatic monologue consisting of a dialogue between three characters: The Youth, Circe, and Ulysses. The poem is written in blank verse, which means it lacks a regular rhyme scheme but maintains iambic pentameter, giving it a natural flow and rhythm. The poem is divided into three sections: The Youth's conversation with Circe, Ulysses' entrance and interaction with The Youth, and The Youth's final monologue.

### Themes and Imagery

One of the central themes of the poem is the seductive power of pleasure and indulgence. The Youth is lured by Circe's wine and falls into a state of intoxication and bliss. This theme is reinforced through vivid and sensory imagery throughout the poem. Arnold uses rich descriptions of nature, such as "night-dews clustered in thick beads" and "cool night-wind, tremulous stars," to create a dreamlike atmosphere. The imagery of the wild procession and the bright forms sweeping through the Youth's soul symbolizes the overwhelming nature of indulgence and the surrender to hedonistic desires.

### Literary Devices

Arnold employs several literary devices to enhance the themes and mood of the poem. One notable device is allusion, as seen in references to Greek mythology and figures like Circe, Ulysses, and Pan. These allusions add depth and complexity to the narrative, drawing parallels between the ancient myths and the contemporary experience of the characters. The use of personification is also prominent, as Circe is portrayed as a seductive and powerful figure who tempts the Youth with her wine. Additionally, Arnold uses imagery, such as the agate brooch-stones on Circe's shoulder and the ivy-cinctured cup, to create a sensual and immersive setting.

### Historical and Personal Context

Matthew Arnold was a Victorian poet and critic known for his introspective and philosophical works. "The Strayed Reveller" was written during the Victorian era, a period marked by social and cultural change, as well as a fascination with classical literature and mythology.

### Deep Reading

At its core, "The Strayed Reveller" explores the conflict between hedonism and self-awareness, as represented by the Youth and Ulysses, respectively.
