## How still, how happy! by Emily Bronte

```
How still, how happy! Those are words
That once would scarce agree together;
I loved the plashing of the surge -
The changing heaven the breezy weather,

More than smooth seas and cloudless skies
And solemn, soothing, softened airs
That in the forest woke no sighs
And from the green spray shook no tears.

How still, how happy! now I feel
Where silence dwells is sweeter far
Than laughing mirth's most joyous swell
However pure its raptures are.

Come, sit down on this sunny stone:
'Tis wintry light o'er flowerless moors -
But sit - for we are all alone
And clear expand heaven's breathless shores.

I could think in the withered grass
Spring's budding wreaths we might discern;
The violet's eye might shyly flash
And young leaves shoot among the fern.

It is but thought - full many a night
The snow shall clothe those hills afar
And storms shall add a drearier blight
And winds shall wage a wilder war,

Before the lark may herald in
Fresh foliage twined with blossoms fair
And summer days again begin
Their glory - haloed crown to wear.

Yet my heart loves December's smile
As much as July's golden beam;
Then let us sit and watch the while
The blue ice curdling on the stream -
```

The poem follows a consistent ABAB rhyme scheme, with alternating end rhymes in each quatrain. The meter is predominantly iambic tetrameter, with lines containing four metrical feet. This consistent structure and meter create a sense of harmony and balance in the poem, mirroring the speaker's contemplative and peaceful mood.

### Themes and Imagery

The poem explores the themes of solitude, nature, and the passage of time. The speaker reflects on their preference for the wild and untamed aspects of nature, such as stormy seas and winter landscapes, over the calm and predictable. The imagery in the poem is vivid and evocative, with descriptions of the sea, sky, moors, and changing seasons. The contrast between the speaker's inner emotional turmoil and the external tranquility of their surroundings adds depth to the theme of finding solace in stillness and solitude.

### Literary Devices

Bronte employs several literary devices in the poem to enhance its meaning. One notable device is personification, as the speaker attributes human qualities to nature, such as the ability to smile in December or the breathless shores of heaven. The use of imagery, such as the violet's eye shyly flashing or the blue ice curdling on the stream, creates a sensory experience for the reader, immersing them in the speaker's contemplation of nature. Additionally, the repetition of the phrases "How still, how happy!" and "But sit" emphasizes the speaker's desire for stillness and solitude.

### Historical and Personal Context

Emily Bronte, known for her introspective and nature-inspired poetry, often explored themes of isolation and emotional depth in her work. As a member of the famous Bronte literary family, Emily experienced personal hardships and loss, which likely influenced her writing. The speaker's preference for the wild and untamed aspects of nature in the poem may reflect Bronte's own complex relationship with the natural world and her inner emotional landscape.

### Deep Reading

The poem "How still, how happy!" delves into the speaker's internal conflict between the desire for solitude and the longing for connection with nature. The juxtaposition of turbulent seas and winter landscapes with calm seas and cloudless skies highlights the speaker's preference for the raw and unpredictable over the serene and predictable. This contrast underscores the speaker's yearning for authenticity and depth in their experiences, rather than surface-level contentment. Ultimately, the poem suggests that true happiness and peace can be found in embracing the stillness and solitude of nature, even in the face of external challenges and changes.

## Disabled by Wilfred Owen

```
He sat in a wheeled chair, waiting for dark,
And shivered in his ghastly suit of grey,
Legless, sewn short at elbow.  Through the park
Voices of boys rang saddening like a hymn,
Voices of play and pleasure after day,
Till gathering sleep had mothered them from him.

About this time Town used to swing so gay
When glow-lamps budded in the light-blue trees
And girls glanced lovelier as the air grew dim,
-- In the old times, before he threw away his knees.
Now he will never feel again how slim
Girls' waists are, or how warm their subtle hands,
All of them touch him like some queer disease.

There was an artist silly for his face,
For it was younger than his youth, last year.
Now he is old; his back will never brace;
He's lost his colour very far from here,
Poured it down shell-holes till the veins ran dry,
And half his lifetime lapsed in the hot race,
And leap of purple spurted from his thigh.
One time he liked a bloodsmear down his leg,
After the matches carried shoulder-high.
It was after football, when he'd drunk a peg,
He thought he'd better join.  He wonders why . . .
Someone had said he'd look a god in kilts.

That's why; and maybe, too, to please his Meg,
Aye, that was it, to please the giddy jilts,
He asked to join.  He didn't have to beg;
Smiling they wrote his lie; aged nineteen years.
Germans he scarcely thought of; and no fears
Of Fear came yet.  He thought of jewelled hilts
For daggers in plaid socks; of smart salutes;
And care of arms; and leave; and pay arrears;
Esprit de corps; and hints for young recruits.
And soon, he was drafted out with drums and cheers.

Some cheered him home, but not as crowds cheer Goal.
Only a solemn man who brought him fruits
Thanked him; and then inquired about his soul.
Now, he will spend a few sick years in Institutes,
And do what things the rules consider wise,
And take whatever pity they may dole.
To-night he noticed how the women's eyes
Passed from him to the strong men that were whole.
How cold and late it is!  Why don't they come
And put him into bed?  Why don't they come?
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

In terms of form, the poem "Disabled" by Wilfred Owen consists of seven stanzas, each with a varying number of lines. The irregular stanza lengths mirror the chaotic and disjointed nature of the soldier's thoughts and experiences. The poem does not follow a consistent meter, contributing to a sense of unease and instability. 

The rhyme scheme in the poem is also irregular, with some stanzas following a AABB rhyme scheme, while others do not rhyme at all. This lack of rhyme and rhythm reflects the broken and fragmented nature of the soldier's life after war.

### Themes and Imagery

One of the central themes in the poem is the devastating impact of war on individuals, specifically focusing on the physical and psychological trauma experienced by soldiers. Owen vividly portrays the soldier's physical disability and the emotional isolation he feels as he is alienated from society. The imagery of the soldier sitting in a wheeled chair, shivering in his grey suit, and feeling disconnected from the joy and warmth of the world around him evokes a sense of profound loss and despair.

The contrast between the soldier's memories of his youth and the harsh reality of his current situation highlights the theme of innocence lost and the irreversible damage caused by war. The image of the soldier pouring his color down shell-holes and losing his vitality emphasizes the dehumanizing effects of conflict.

### Literary Devices

Owen employs various literary devices to convey the themes of the poem. One notable device is imagery, which is used to create a vivid and powerful depiction of the soldier's physical and emotional suffering. The use of simile in the line "All of them touch him like some queer disease" compares the soldier's interactions with others to a contagious illness, emphasizing his sense of alienation.

The poem also features irony, particularly in the soldier's youthful enthusiasm for war and the reality of his current situation. The repetition of the phrase "Why don't they come" at the end of the poem creates a haunting and poignant refrain, underscoring the soldier's loneliness and desperation.

### Historical and Personal Context

Wilfred Owen was an English poet who served as a soldier in World War I, and his poetry often reflects his firsthand experiences of the brutality and futility of war. "Disabled" was written during Owen's time in a hospital recovering from shell shock, providing a personal and intimate perspective on the physical and psychological toll of combat.

The poem offers a stark critique of the glorification of war and the way in which young men were misled and exploited for the sake of patriotism and nationalism. Owen's anti-war stance is evident in his portrayal of the soldier's disillusionment and the devastating consequences of conflict on individual lives.

### Deep Reading

Through "Disabled," Wilfred Owen delves deep into the aftermath of war, exploring the profound impact it has on those who have served. The fragmented structure and lack of rhyme reflect the shattered lives of soldiers who return from war physically and mentally broken. The repetition of the soldier's longing for companionship and care underscores the profound sense of isolation and abandonment he feels.

The poem serves as a powerful meditation on the loss of innocence, the cruelty of war, and the lasting scars it leaves on those who survive. Owen's poignant portrayal of the disabled soldier invites readers to confront the harsh realities of war and to question the societal attitudes towards those who have sacrificed so much in the name of duty.
