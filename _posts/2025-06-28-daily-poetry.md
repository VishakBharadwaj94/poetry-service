## Pheidippides by Robert Browning

```
First I salute this soil of the blessed, river and rock!
Gods of my birthplace, dæmons and heroes, honour to all!
Then I name thee, claim thee for our patron, co-equal in praise
--Ay, with Zeus the Defender, with Her of the ægis and spear!
Also, ye of the bow and the buskin, praised be your peer,

Now, henceforth, and forever,--O latest to whom I upraise
Hand and heart and voice! For Athens, leave pasture and flock!
Present to help, potent to save, Pan--patron I call!
Archons of Athens, topped by the tettix, see, I return!
See, 'tis myself here standing alive, no spectre that speaks!
Crowned with the myrtle, did you command me, Athens and you,
"Run, Pheidippides, run and race, reach Sparta for aid!
Persia has come, we are here, where is She?" Your command I obeyed,
Ran and raced: like stubble, some field which a fire runs through,
Was the space between city and city: two days, two nights did I burn
Over the hills, under the dales, down pits and up peaks.

Into their midst I broke: breath served but for "Persia has come!
Persia bids Athens proffer slaves'-tribute, water and earth;
Razed to the ground is Eretria.--but Athens, shall Athens sink,
Drop into dust and die--the flower of Hellas utterly die,
Die with the wide world spitting at Sparta, the stupid, the stander-by?
Answer me quick,--what help, what hand do you stretch o'er destruction's brink?
How,--when? No care for my limbs!--there's lightning in all and some--
Fresh and fit your message to bear, once lips give it birth!"

O my Athens--Sparta love thee? did Sparta respond?
Every face of her leered in a furrow of envy, mistrust,
Malice,--each eye of her gave me its glitter of gratified hate!
Gravely they turned to take counsel, to cast for excuses. I stood
Quivering,--the limbs of me fretting as fire frets, an inch from dry wood:
"Persia has come, Athens asks aid, and still they debate?
Thunder, thou Zeus! Athene, are Spartans a quarry beyond
Swing of thy spear? Phoibos and Artemis, clang them 'Ye must'!"

No bolt launched from Olumpos! Lo, their answer at last!
"Has Persia come,--does Athens ask aid,--may Sparta befriend?
Nowise precipitate judgment--too weighty the issue at stake!
Count we no time lost time which lags thro' respect to the Gods!
Ponder that precept of old, 'No warfare, whatever the odds
In your favour, so long as the moon, half-orbed, is unable to take
Full-circle her state in the sky!' Already she rounds to it fast:
Athens must wait, patient as we--who judgment suspend."

Athens,--except for that sparkle,--thy name, I had mouldered to ash!
That sent a blaze thro' my blood; off, off and away was I back,
--Not one word to waste, one look to lose on the false and the vile!
Yet "O Gods of my land!" I cried, as each hillock and plain,
Wood and stream, I knew, I named, rushing past them again,
"Have ye kept faith, proved mindful of honours we paid you erewhile?
Vain was the filleted victim, the fulsome libation! Too rash
Love in its choice, paid you so largely service so slack!

"Oak and olive and bay,--I bid you cease to en-wreathe
Brows made bold by your leaf! Fade at the Persian's foot,
You that, our patrons were pledged, should never adorn a slave!
Rather I hail thee, Parnes,--trust to thy wild waste tract!
Treeless, herbless, lifeless mountain! What matter if slacked
My speed may hardly be, for homage to crag and to cave
No deity deigns to drape with verdure?--at least I can breathe,
Fear in thee no fraud from the blind, no lie from the mute!"

Such my cry as, rapid, I ran over Parnes' ridge;
Gully and gap I clambered and cleared till, sudden, a bar
Jutted, a stoppage of stone against me, blocking the way.
Right! for I minded the hollow to traverse, the fissure across:
"Where I could enter, there I depart by! Night in the fosse?
Athens to aid? Tho' the dive were thro' Erebos, thus I obey--
Out of the day dive, into the day as bravely arise! No bridge
Better!"--when--ha! what was it I came on, of wonders that are?

There, in the cool of a cleft, sat he--majestical Pan!
Ivy drooped wanton, kissed his head, moss cushioned his hoof;
All the great God was good in the eyes grave-kindly--the curl
Carved on the bearded cheek, amused at a mortal's awe
As, under the human trunk, the goat-thighs grand I saw.
"Halt, Pheidippides!"--halt I did, my brain of a whirl:
"Hither to me! Why pale in my presence?"! he gracious began:
"How is it,--Athens, only in Hellas, holds me aloof?

"Athens, she only, rears me no fane, makes me no feast!
Wherefore? Than I what godship to Athens more helpful of old?
Ay, and still, and forever her friend! Test Pan, trust me!
Go bid Athens take heart, laugh Persia to scorn, have faith
In the temples and tombs! Go, say to Athens, 'The Goat-God saith:
When Persia--so much as strews not the soil--Is cast in the sea,
Then praise Pan who fought in the ranks with your most and least,
Goat-thigh to greaved-thigh, made one cause with the free and the bold!'

"Say Pan saith: 'Let this, foreshowing the place, be the pledge!'"
(Gay, the liberal hand held out this herbage I bear
--Fennel,--I grasped it a-tremble with dew--whatever it bode),
"While, as for thee..." But enough! He was gone. If I ran hitherto--
Be sure that the rest of my journey, I ran no longer, but flew.
Parnes to Athens--earth no more, the air was my road;
Here am I back. Praise Pan, we stand no more on the razor's edge!
Pan for Athens, Pan for me! I too have a guerdon rare!

Then spoke Miltiades. "And thee, best runner of Greece,
Whose limbs did duty indeed,--what gift is promised thyself?
Tell it us straightway,--Athens the mother demands of her son!"
Rosily blushed the youth: he paused: but, lifting at length
His eyes from the ground, it seemed as he gathered the rest of his strength
Into the utterance--"Pan spoke thus: 'For what thou hast done
Count on a worthy reward! Henceforth be allowed thee release
From the racer's toil, no vulgar reward in praise or in pelf!'

"I am bold to believe, Pan means reward the most to my mind!
Fight I shall, with our foremost, wherever this fennel may grow,--
Pound--Pan helping us--Persia to dust, and, under the deep,
Whelm her away forever; and then,--no Athens to save,--
Marry a certain maid, I know keeps faith to the brave,--
Hie to my house and home: and, when my children shall creep
Close to my knees,--recount how the God was awful yet kind,
Promised their sire reward to the full--rewarding him--so!"

Unforeseeing one! Yes, he fought on the Marathon day:
So, when Persia was dust, all cried "To Akropolis!
Run, Pheidippides, one race more! the meed is thy due!
'Athens is saved, thank Pan,' go shout!" He flung down his shield,
Ran like fire once more: and the space 'twixt the Fennel-field
And Athens was stubble again, a field which a fire runs through,
Till in he broke: "Rejoice, we conquer!" Like wine thro' clay,
Joy in his blood bursting his heart, he died--the bliss!

So, to this day, when friend meets friend, the word of salute
Is still "Rejoice!"--his word which brought rejoicing indeed.
So is Pheidippides happy forever,--the noble strong man
Who could race like a god, bear the face of a god, whom a god loved so well,
He saw the land saved he had helped to save, and was suffered to tell
Such tidings, yet never decline, but, gloriously as he began,
So to end gloriously--once to shout, thereafter be mute:
"Athens is saved!"--Pheidippides dies in the shout for his meed.

The lack of a consistent rhyme scheme allows the poem to flow naturally and gives the poet freedom to focus on the narrative and thematic elements. The poem is divided into stanzas of varying lengths, with each stanza focusing on a specific moment or aspect of the story. The irregular structure mirrors the urgency and intensity of Pheidippides' journey and the emotional highs and lows he experiences.

### Themes and Imagery

The use of nature imagery, such as references to mountains, rivers, and forests, adds to the overall atmosphere of the poem and underscores the connection between the protagonist and the natural world.

### Literary Devices
Browning employs several literary devices to enhance the poem's impact. Alliteration is used in phrases like "flower of Hellas" and "fresh and fit" to create a musical quality and emphasize certain words. Personification is present in lines like "Thunder, thou Zeus!" where natural elements are attributed human characteristics, adding depth to the narrative. The repetition of certain phrases, such as "Athens is saved," serves to reinforce key moments in the story and highlight their significance. Browning also uses symbolism, such as the fennel plant given by Pan as a token of reward, to represent hope, victory, and divine intervention.

### Historical and Personal Context
The poem is based on the historical event of the Battle of Marathon in 490 BC, where the Athenians defeated the invading Persian army. Pheidippides was a real historical figure who supposedly ran from Marathon to Athens to deliver the news of the victory before collapsing and dying.

## Rain by Edward Thomas

```
RAIN, midnight rain, nothing but the wild rain
On this bleak hut, and solitude, and me
Remembering again that I shall die
And neither hear the rain nor give it thanks
For washing me cleaner than I have been
Since I was born into this solitude.
Blessed are the dead that the rain rains upon:
But here I pray that none whom once I loved
Is dying to-night or lying still awake
Solitary, listening to the rain,
Either in pain or thus in sympathy
Helpless among the living and the dead,
Like a cold water among broken reeds,
Myriads of broken reeds all still and stiff,
Like me who have no love which this wild rain
Has not dissolved except the love of death,
If love it be towards what is perfect and
Cannot, the tempest tells me, disappoint.
```

The imagery of rain washing the speaker cleaner than he has ever been since birth suggests a spiritual rebirth or cleansing of the soul. The rain becomes a metaphor for both life and death, as it brings solace to the dead but also serves as a reminder of mortality for the living.

### Literary Devices
Thomas employs various literary devices to enhance the emotional depth of the poem. The repetition of the word "rain" at the beginning of the poem creates a sense of rhythm and emphasizes the speaker's fixation on this natural phenomenon. The use of personification, such as the rain having the ability to "wash" and "thank," adds a layer of emotion and agency to the rain itself. Additionally, the imagery of "broken reeds" and the comparison of the speaker to them conveys a sense of fragility and vulnerability.

### Historical and Personal Context
Edward Thomas was a poet who often explored themes of nature, solitude, and mortality in his works. He wrote during a tumultuous period in history, as his poetry reflects the anxieties and uncertainties of the early 20th century. Thomas's personal struggles with depression and his eventual death in World War I add a poignant layer of context to his poetry, including "Rain." The poem can be seen as a reflection of his own inner turmoil and contemplation of mortality.

### Deep Reading
At its core, "Rain" delves into the complexities of human emotions in the face of mortality and solitude. The speaker's musings on death, love, and the cleansing power of rain evoke a sense of introspection and vulnerability.

## To tell the Beauty would decrease by Emily Dickinson

```
To tell the Beauty would decrease
To state the Spell demean --
There is a syllable-less Sea
Of which it is the sign --
My will endeavors for its word
And fails, but entertains
A Rapture as of Legacies --
Of introspective Mines --
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme
The poem "To tell the Beauty would decrease" by Emily Dickinson consists of four quatrains with a consistent rhyme scheme of ABAB. The structure is regular, with each stanza containing four lines. There is no specific meter in this poem, but it flows smoothly and rhythmically, creating a sense of contemplation and introspection.

### Themes and Imagery
The central theme of the poem revolves around the idea that beauty is ineffable and transcendent, unable to be fully captured or described in words. The speaker suggests that attempting to articulate beauty diminishes its essence, as seen in lines 1-2: "To tell the Beauty would decrease / To state the Spell demean --". The imagery of a "syllable-less Sea" as a symbol of beauty that cannot be fully expressed adds to the mysterious and enigmatic quality of the theme. The speaker's struggle to find the right words to convey this beauty reflects a sense of awe and reverence for the intangible.

### Literary Devices
Dickinson employs various literary devices to enhance the poem's meaning and impact. The use of personification is evident in lines 7-8, where the speaker's will is described as "endeavors for its word." This personification of the will highlights the speaker's earnest attempt to capture beauty in words. The imagery of "introspective Mines" in the final stanza conveys the idea of exploring one's inner depths and emotions in search of meaning and understanding.

### Historical and Personal Context
Emily Dickinson, known for her introspective and often enigmatic poems, lived a reclusive life and grappled with themes of beauty, nature, and the ineffable in her work. This poem reflects Dickinson's fascination with the elusive nature of beauty and her belief in the power of poetry to capture fleeting moments of transcendence. Dickinson's personal struggles with isolation and her deep introspection likely influenced her exploration of themes related to beauty and the limitations of language.

### Deep Reading
The title of the poem, "To tell the Beauty would decrease," sets the tone for the speaker's contemplation of the limitations of language in conveying profound experiences. By suggesting that describing beauty diminishes its impact, Dickinson challenges conventional notions of poetic expression. The speaker's failure to find the right words to capture beauty ultimately leads to a sense of "Rapture as of Legacies" in the penultimate stanza, hinting at the transformative power of aesthetic experiences. Overall, the poem invites readers to reflect on the complexities of articulating beauty and the inherent limitations of language in capturing the sublime.
