## Apparitions by Robert Browning

```
Such a starved bank of moss
  Till, that May-morn,
Blue ran the flash across:
  Violets were born!

Sky--what a scowl of cloud
  Till, near and far,
Ray on ray split the shroud:
  Splendid, a star!

World--how it walled about
  Life with disgrace,
Till God's own smile came out:
  That was thy face!
```

This personification serves to emphasize the contrast between the initial darkness and the eventual brightness.

Another literary device used in the poem is metaphor, where abstract concepts are likened to concrete objects. For example, God's smile is compared to a source of light breaking through a shroud, conveying the idea of divine intervention and revelation. This metaphor adds depth to the spiritual themes of the poem and underscores the transformative power of faith.

## Roses by Joyce Kilmer

```
(For Katherine Bregy)

I went to gather roses and twine them in a ring,
For I would make a posy, a posy for the King.
I got an hundred roses, the loveliest there be,
From the white rose vine and the pink rose bush and from the red
rose tree.
But when I took my posy and laid it at His feet
I found He had His roses a million times more sweet.
There was a scarlet blossom upon each foot and hand,
And a great pink rose bloomed from His side for the healing of the
land.
Now of this fair and awful King there is this marvel told,
That He wears a crown of linked thorns instead of one of gold.
Where there are thorns are roses, and I saw a line of red,
A little wreath of roses around His radiant head.
A red rose is His Sacred Heart, a white rose is His face,
And His breath has turned the barren world to a rich and flowery
place.
He is the Rose of Sharon, His gardener am I,
And I shall drink His fragrance in Heaven when I die.
```

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem revolves around the symbolism of roses in relation to Christ. The speaker gathers roses to create a posy for the King, representing a gesture of devotion and love. However, upon presenting the posy to the King, the speaker realizes that the roses pales in comparison to the roses that adorn the King himself. The imagery of roses, particularly the scarlet blossoms on Christ's body, symbolizes his sacrifice and redemption. The contrast between the earthly roses and the divine roses highlights the incomparable beauty and significance of Christ's love.

### Literary Devices

Kilmer employs several literary devices to enhance the poem's meaning. One prominent device is symbolism, with roses representing love, sacrifice, and redemption. The imagery of the scarlet blossom on Christ's body and the pink rose blooming from His side evoke powerful emotions and religious connotations. Additionally, the use of personification is evident in lines such as "He is the Rose of Sharon, His gardener am I," where Christ is likened to a rose and the speaker to a gardener. This personification adds depth to the relationship between Christ and the speaker.

### Historical and Personal Context

### Deep Reading

In a deeper analysis, the poem can be seen as a meditation on the nature of divine love and sacrifice. The act of gathering roses and presenting them to Christ symbolizes the speaker's desire to offer something beautiful and meaningful to the King. However, the realization that Christ's own sacrifice far surpasses any earthly offering underscores the profound depth of His love. The image of Christ wearing a crown of thorns instead of gold highlights the paradoxical nature of His kingship, where suffering and sacrifice are central to His identity. Ultimately, the poem conveys a message of humility, devotion, and the transformative power of Christ's love in the world.

## Merry Autumn by Paul Laurence Dunbar

```
It's all a farce,—these tales they tell
  About the breezes sighing,
And moans astir o'er field and dell,
  Because the year is dying.

Such principles are most absurd,—
  I care not who first taught 'em;
There's nothing known to beast or bird
  To make a solemn autumn.

In solemn times, when grief holds sway
  With countenance distressing,
You'll note the more of black and gray
  Will then be used in dressing.

Now purple tints are all around;
  The sky is blue and mellow;
And e'en the grasses turn the ground
  From modest green to yellow.

The seed burs all with laughter crack
  On featherweed and jimson;
And leaves that should be dressed in black
  Are all decked out in crimson.

A butterfly goes winging by;
  A singing bird comes after;
And Nature, all from earth to sky,
  Is bubbling o'er with laughter.

The ripples wimple on the rills,
  Like sparkling little lasses;
The sunlight runs along the hills,
  And laughs among the grasses.

The earth is just so full of fun
  It really can't contain it;
And streams of mirth so freely run
  The heavens seem to rain it.

Don't talk to me of solemn days
  In autumn's time of splendor,
Because the sun shows fewer rays,
  And these grow slant and slender.

Why, it's the climax of the year,—
  The highest time of living!—
Till naturally its bursting cheer
  Just melts into thanksgiving.
```
