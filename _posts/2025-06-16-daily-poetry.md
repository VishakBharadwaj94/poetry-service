## Love and Friendship by Emily Bronte

```
Love is like the wild rose-briar,
Friendship like the holly-tree --
The holly is dark when the rose-briar blooms
But which will bloom most contantly?
The wild-rose briar is sweet in the spring,
Its summer blossoms scent the air;
Yet wait till winter comes again
And who wil call the wild-briar fair?
Then scorn the silly rose-wreath now
And deck thee with the holly's sheen,
That when December blights thy brow
He may still leave thy garland green.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

Emily Bronte's poem "Love and Friendship" consists of twelve lines divided into three quatrains, following an ABAB rhyme scheme. The poem is written in iambic tetrameter, with each line consisting of four iambs (unstressed syllable followed by a stressed syllable). This regular meter and rhyme scheme give the poem a musical quality and a sense of balance and symmetry.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem is the contrast between love and friendship. Bronte uses the imagery of the wild rose-briar and the holly-tree to symbolize love and friendship, respectively. The wild rose-briar is associated with fleeting beauty and sweetness, particularly in spring and summer, while the holly-tree represents enduring strength and constancy, even in harsh winter conditions. The poem explores the idea that while love may be attractive and alluring in its initial stages, it is friendship's enduring qualities that truly matter in the long run.

### Literary Devices

Bronte employs several literary devices in "Love and Friendship" to enhance the poem's meaning. One notable device is metaphor, where love is compared to the wild rose-briar and friendship to the holly-tree. This metaphor is sustained throughout the poem, allowing Bronte to explore the contrasting characteristics of love and friendship in a vivid and evocative way. Additionally, there is personification in the lines "And deck thee with the holly's sheen," where the holly tree is given human-like qualities of adorning oneself with its sheen.

### Historical and Personal Context

Emily Bronte was part of the famous Bronte literary family in the 19th century, known for their contributions to English literature. Bronte's work often delves into themes of nature, love, and human relationships. Given the societal norms of her time, where romantic love was often idealized and prioritized, it is interesting that Bronte chooses to elevate the value of friendship over love in this poem. This could reflect her personal beliefs or experiences, or serve as a commentary on the transience of romantic love compared to the enduring nature of friendship.

### Deep Reading

In a deeper analysis of "Love and Friendship," one could interpret the poem as a reflection on the complexities of human relationships. Bronte suggests that while love may be alluring and beautiful, it is friendship that provides true support and constancy, especially during challenging times. The shifting seasons in the poem symbolize the changing nature of relationships, with love fading like the wild rose-briar in winter, while friendship remains steadfast like the holly's evergreen leaves. Ultimately, Bronte seems to advocate for valuing and nurturing enduring friendships that can weather the storms of life.

## An Enigma by Edgar Allan Poe

```
"Seldom we find," says Solomon Don Dunce,
  "Half an idea in the profoundest sonnet.
Through all the flimsy things we see at once
  As easily as through a Naples bonnet--
  Trash of all trash!--how _can_ a lady don it?
Yet heavier far than your Petrarchan stuff--
Owl-downy nonsense that the faintest puff
  Twirls into trunk-paper the while you con it."
And, veritably, Sol is right enough.
The general tuckermanities are arrant
Bubbles--ephemeral and _so_ transparent--
  But _this is_, now--you may depend upon it--
Stable, opaque, immortal--all by dint
Of the dear names that lie concealed within't.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

In terms of form, "An Enigma" by Edgar Allan Poe is a sonnet consisting of 14 lines. The poem follows a structured rhyme scheme of ABABCDCDEFEFGG, with the rhyming lines alternating throughout the poem. The meter of the poem is primarily iambic pentameter, with each line containing five metrical feet.

### Themes and Imagery

The poem explores the idea of depth and superficiality in poetry and art. Solomon Dunce criticizes the lack of true substance in many sonnets, emphasizing the importance of meaningful content over frivolous embellishments. The imagery in the poem contrasts the "flimsy things" and "trash" of conventional sonnets with the solidity and immortality of the enigma being described. The references to "Naples bonnet" and "Petrarchan stuff" serve to highlight the superficial nature of certain artistic expressions.

### Literary Devices

Poe employs various literary devices in "An Enigma" to enhance the poem's meaning. One notable device is irony, as Solomon Dunce's critique of shallow poetry ultimately praises the enigmatic sonnet being described. The use of alliteration in phrases like "Owl-downy nonsense" and "faintest puff" adds musicality to the poem. Additionally, Poe uses personification when he describes the "bubbles" of conventional sonnets as "ephemeral and so transparent," contrasting them with the enigmatic sonnet that is portrayed as stable and opaque.

### Historical and Personal Context

During Poe's time, there was a debate surrounding the value of traditional forms of poetry versus more innovative and unconventional approaches. Poe himself was known for his exploration of dark and mysterious themes in his works, which is reflected in the enigmatic nature of the sonnet in this poem. The reference to Petrarchan sonnets also speaks to Poe's engagement with literary traditions and his willingness to challenge established norms.

### Deep Reading

On a deeper level, "An Enigma" can be seen as a reflection of Poe's own struggles with the limitations of conventional poetry and his desire to create something timeless and profound. The enigma described in the poem can be interpreted as a metaphor for the hidden complexities and deeper meanings that lie beneath the surface of art and literature. By concealing "dear names" within the enigma, Poe suggests that true artistry involves layers of meaning that require careful unraveling to fully appreciate. Overall, the poem invites readers to consider the elusive nature of art and the enduring power of works that defy easy interpretation.

## The Autumn by Elizabeth Barrett Browning

```
Go, sit upon the lofty hill,
And turn your eyes around,
Where waving woods and waters wild
Do hymn an autumn sound.
The summer sun is faint on them --
The summer flowers depart --
Sit still -- as all transform'd to stone,
Except your musing heart.

How there you sat in summer-time,
May yet be in your mind;
And how you heard the green woods sing
Beneath the freshening wind.
Though the same wind now blows around,
You would its blast recall;
For every breath that stirs the trees,
Doth cause a leaf to fall.

Oh! like that wind, is all the mirth
That flesh and dust impart:
We cannot bear its visitings,
When change is on the heart.
Gay words and jests may make us smile,
When Sorrow is asleep;
But other things must make us smile,
When Sorrow bids us weep!

The dearest hands that clasp our hands, --
Their presence may be o'er;
The dearest voice that meets our ear,
That tone may come no more!
Youth fades; and then, the joys of youth,
Which once refresh'd our mind,
Shall come -- as, on those sighing woods,
The chilling autumn wind.

Hear not the wind -- view not the woods;
Look out o'er vale and hill-
In spring, the sky encircled them --
The sky is round them still.
Come autumn's scathe -- come winter's cold --
Come change -- and human fate!
Whatever prospect Heaven doth bound,
Can ne'er be desolate.
```
