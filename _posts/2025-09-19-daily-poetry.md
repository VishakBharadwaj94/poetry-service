## A Better Ressurection by Christina Rossetti

```
I have no wit, no words, no tears;
My heart within me like a stone
Is numbed too much for hopes or fears.
Look right, look left, I dwell alone;
I lift mine eyes, but dimmed with grief
No everlasting hills I see;
My life is in the falling leaf:
O Jesus, quicken me.

My life is like a faded leaf,
My harvest dwindled to a husk:
Truly my life is void and brief
And tedious in the barren dusk;
My life is like a frozen thing,
No bud nor greenness can I see:
Yet rise it shall--the sap of spring;
O Jesus, rise in me.

My life is like a broken bowl,
A broken bowl that cannot hold
One drop of water for my soul
Or cordial in the searching cold;
Cast in the fire the perished thing;
Melt and remould it, till it be
A royal cup for Him, my King:
O Jesus, drink of me.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

In "A Better Resurrection," Christina Rossetti employs a consistent structure with three stanzas, each consisting of six lines. The rhyme scheme is ABABCC, creating a musical and lyrical flow throughout the poem. The meter is primarily iambic tetrameter, with four stressed syllables per line, contributing to the poem's rhythmic quality. Rossetti's use of repetition in the opening and closing lines of each stanza ("My life is..." and "O Jesus,") adds to the overall structure and reinforces the central themes of the poem.

### Themes and Imagery

The central themes of "A Better Resurrection" revolve around spiritual renewal, transformation, and faith in Jesus Christ. The imagery of the faded leaf, frozen thing, and broken bowl conveys a sense of despair, emptiness, and brokenness in the speaker's life. The references to nature, such as the falling leaf and the sap of spring, symbolize the cycle of life, death, and rebirth. The repeated invocation of Jesus throughout the poem suggests a longing for divine intervention and restoration.

### Literary Devices

Rossetti employs several literary devices to enhance the poem's emotional impact. The use of simile in lines like "My heart within me like a stone" and "My life is like a faded leaf" creates vivid comparisons that evoke a sense of heaviness and transience. The metaphor of the broken bowl symbolizes the speaker's inability to contain spiritual nourishment. Additionally, the repetition of the plea to Jesus functions as an apostrophe, directly addressing a divine entity for salvation and renewal.

### Historical and Personal Context

Christina Rossetti, a Victorian poet known for her religious themes, likely drew inspiration from her own spiritual struggles and experiences. As a devout Christian, Rossetti often explored themes of faith, redemption, and salvation in her poetry. The poem's emphasis on Jesus as a source of transformation reflects Rossetti's deep religious convictions and her belief in the power of divine grace to heal and restore the broken aspects of human existence.

### Deep Reading

"A Better Resurrection" can be interpreted as a profound meditation on the human condition and the universal desire for spiritual renewal. The speaker's sense of desolation and emptiness is palpable, yet there is also a glimmer of hope and faith in the possibility of transformation. Through the imagery of decay and regeneration, Rossetti suggests that true resurrection comes not from external circumstances but from a profound inner renewal that only divine intervention can bring. Ultimately, the poem invites readers to reflect on their own spiritual journeys and the transformative power of faith in times of despair.

## I Wandered Lonely As A Cloud by William Wordsworth

```
I wandered lonely as a cloud
That floats on high o'er vales and hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
A host, of golden daffodils;
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.

Continuous as the stars that shine
And twinkle on the milky way,
They stretched in never-ending line
Along the margin of a bay:
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.

 The waves beside them danced, but they
Out-did the sparkling leaves in glee;
A poet could not be but gay,
In such a jocund company!
I gazed—and gazed—but little thought
What wealth the show to me had brought:

For oft, when on my couch I lie
In vacant or in pensive mood,
They flash upon that inward eye
Which is the bliss of solitude;
And then my heart with pleasure fills,
And dances with the daffodils.
```

## I got so I could take his name by Emily Dickinson

```
I got so I could take his name --
Without -- Tremendous gain --
That Stop-sensation -- on my Soul --
And Thunder -- in the Room --

I got so I could walk across
That Angle in the floor,
Where he turned so, and I turned -- how --
And all our Sinew tore --

I got so I could stir the Box --
In which his letters grew
Without that forcing, in my breath --
As Staples -- driven through --

Could dimly recollect a Grace --
I think, they call it "God" --
Renowned to ease Extremity --
When Formula, had failed --

And shape my Hands --
Petition's way,
Tho' ignorant of a word
That Ordination -- utters --

My Business, with the Cloud,
If any Power behind it, be,
Not subject to Despair --
It care, in some remoter way,
For so minute affair
As Misery --
Itself, too vast, for interrupting -- more --
```

### Themes and Imagery

The imagery of physical pain and tearing sinews when walking across a specific angle in the room conveys the agony and struggle of merging her identity with another person's. The mention of "thunder in the room" and "stop-sensation on my soul" suggests a sense of disruption and discord in the speaker's emotional state.

### Literary Devices

Dickinson employs various literary devices to convey the speaker's emotional turmoil. The use of enjambment, where sentences continue beyond the line break, creates a sense of continuity and flow, reflecting the speaker's internal conflict.

The metaphor of stirring a box containing the partner's letters symbolizes the delicate balance between preserving memories and feeling overwhelmed by the past.

### Historical and Personal Context

Emily Dickinson lived during the 19th century, a time when women were expected to take on their husband's name upon marriage. This societal expectation likely influenced the poem's exploration of identity and autonomy within a relationship.

The personal context of Dickinson's own introspective and reclusive nature adds depth to the poem's exploration of inner conflict and emotional struggle.
