## The Night Journey by Rupert Brooke

```
Hands and lit faces eddy to a line;
The dazed last minutes click; the clamour dies.
Beyond the great-swung arc o' the roof, divine,
Night, smoky-scarv'd, with thousand coloured eyes

Glares the imperious mystery of the way.
Thirsty for dark, you feel the long-limbed train
Throb, stretch, thrill motion, slide, pull out and sway,
Strain for the far, pause, draw to strength again. . . .

As a man, caught by some great hour, will rise,
Slow-limbed, to meet the light or find his love;
And, breathing long, with staring sightless eyes,
Hands out, head back, agape and silent, move

Sure as a flood, smooth as a vast wind blowing;
And, gathering power and purpose as he goes,
Unstumbling, unreluctant, strong, unknowing,
Borne by a will not his, that lifts, that grows,

Sweep out to darkness, triumphing in his goal,
Out of the fire, out of the little room. . . .
-- There is an end appointed, O my soul!
Crimson and green the signals burn; the gloom

Is hung with steam's far-blowing livid streamers.
Lost into God, as lights in light, we fly,
Grown one with will, end-drunken huddled dreamers.
The white lights roar. The sounds of the world die.

And lips and laughter are forgotten things.
Speed sharpens; grows. Into the night, and on,
The strength and splendour of our purpose swings.
The lamps fade; and the stars. We are alone.
```

Rupert Brooke's poem "The Night Journey" is structured as a sonnet, consisting of 14 lines. The poem follows the traditional rhyme scheme of ABABCDCDEFEFGG. The meter is predominantly iambic pentameter, with five stressed syllables in each line.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem revolves around a physical journey that serves as a metaphor for a spiritual or emotional transformation. The imagery of a train journey through the night is used to convey a sense of mystery, darkness, and introspection. The night symbolizes the unknown and the journey represents a search for understanding and purpose.

The use of vivid imagery, such as "Night, smoky-scarv'd, with thousand coloured eyes" and "Crimson and green the signals burn", creates a dreamlike atmosphere, emphasizing the surreal nature of the journey. The contrast between light and darkness, as well as the imagery of speed and motion, conveys a sense of urgency and inevitability.

### Literary Devices

Brooke employs various literary devices to enhance the themes and imagery of the poem. Imagery is particularly prominent, with vivid descriptions of the night sky, the train in motion, and the transformation of the speaker. The use of personification is evident in lines such as "Thirsty for dark" and "Borne by a will not his", giving agency to abstract concepts.

There is also a use of simile in the comparison of the speaker to a man rising to meet the light or find his love. This comparison highlights the transformative nature of the journey and the sense of purpose driving the speaker forward. Additionally, the repetition of sounds, such as the alliteration in "smooth as a vast wind blowing", creates a sense of rhythm and momentum.

### Historical and Personal Context

"The Night Journey" was written during a time of great social and cultural change, with rapid industrialization and technological advancements shaping the modern world.

The poem can be seen as a reflection of the uncertainties and complexities of the modern age, with the train journey symbolizing the individual's quest for meaning and direction in a rapidly changing world. Brooke's personal experiences, including his travels and relationships, likely influenced the themes and imagery of the poem.

### Deep Reading

On a deeper level, "The Night Journey" can be interpreted as a meditation on the nature of existence and the search for spiritual enlightenment. The journey through the night symbolizes the darkness of the unknown, while the emergence into light represents a moment of clarity and revelation.

The speaker's transformation from a state of uncertainty and confusion to one of purpose and determination mirrors the internal struggle faced by individuals in their quest for self-discovery. The journey becomes a metaphor for the human experience, with its trials and triumphs, its doubts and revelations.

Ultimately, the poem suggests that through perseverance and introspection, one can find meaning and fulfillment in the face of life's uncertainties. The journey, both literal and metaphorical, leads to a deeper understanding of the self and the world, culminating in a sense of unity and purpose.

## Buried Life, The by Matthew Arnold

```
Light flows our war of mocking words, and yet,
Behold, with tears mine eyes are wet!
I feel a nameless sadness o'er me roll.
Yes, yes, we know that we can jest,
We know, we know that we can smile!
But there's a something in this breast,
To which thy light words bring no rest,
And thy gay smiles no anodyne.
Give me thy hand, and hush awhile,
And turn those limpid eyes on mine,
And let me read there, love! thy inmost soul.

Alas! is even love too weak
To unlock the heart, and let it speak?
Are even lovers powerless to reveal
To one another what indeed they feel?
I knew the mass of men conceal'd
Their thoughts, for fear that if reveal'd
They would by other men be met
With blank indifference, or with blame reproved;
I knew they lived and moved
Trick'd in disguises, alien to the rest
Of men, and alien to themselves--and yet
The same heart beats in every human breast!

But we, my love!--doth a like spell benumb
Our hearts, our voices?--must we too be dumb?

Ah! well for us, if even we,
Even for a moment, can get free
Our heart, and have our lips unchain'd;
For that which seals them hath been deep-ordain'd!

Fate, which foresaw
How frivolous a baby man would be--
By what distractions he would be possess'd,
How he would pour himself in every strife,
And well-nigh change his own identity--
That it might keep from his capricious play
His genuine self, and force him to obey
Even in his own despite his being's law,
Bade through the deep recesses of our breast
The unregarded river of our life
Pursue with indiscernible flow its way;
And that we should not see
The buried stream, and seem to be
Eddying at large in blind uncertainty,
Though driving on with it eternally.

But often, in the world's most crowded streets,
But often, in the din of strife,
There rises an unspeakable desire
After the knowledge of our buried life;
A thirst to spend our fire and restless force
In tracking out our true, original course;
A longing to inquire
Into the mystery of this heart which beats
So wild, so deep in us--to know
Whence our lives come and where they go.
And many a man in his own breast then delves,
But deep enough, alas! none ever mines.
And we have been on many thousand lines,
And we have shown, on each, spirit and power;
But hardly have we, for one little hour,
Been on our own line, have we been ourselves--
Hardly had skill to utter one of all
The nameless feelings that course through our breast,
But they course on for ever unexpress'd.
And long we try in vain to speak and act
Our hidden self, and what we say and do
Is eloquent, is well--but 't#is not true!
And then we will no more be rack'd
With inward striving, and demand
Of all the thousand nothings of the hour
Their stupefying power;
Ah yes, and they benumb us at our call!
Yet still, from time to time, vague and forlorn,
From the soul's subterranean depth upborne
As from an infinitely distant land,
Come airs, and floating echoes, and convey
A melancholy into all our day.
Only--but this is rare--
When a belov{'e}d hand is laid in ours,
When, jaded with the rush and glare
Of the interminable hours,
Our eyes can in another's eyes read clear,
When our world-deafen'd ear
Is by the tones of a loved voice caress'd--
A bolt is shot back somewhere in our breast,
And a lost pulse of feeling stirs again.
The eye sinks inward, and the heart lies plain,
And what we mean, we say, and what we would, we know.
A man becomes aware of his life's flow,
And hears its winding murmur; and he sees
The meadows where it glides, the sun, the breeze.

And there arrives a lull in the hot race
Wherein he doth for ever chase
That flying and elusive shadow, rest.
An air of coolness plays upon his face,
And an unwonted calm pervades his breast.
And then he thinks he knows
The hills where his life rose,
And the sea where it goes.
```

## Winter Song by Wilfred Owen

```
The browns, the olives, and the yellows died,
And were swept up to heaven; where they glowed
Each dawn and set of sun till Christmastide,
And when the land lay pale for them, pale-snowed,
Fell back, and down the snow-drifts flamed and flowed.

From off your face, into the winds of winter,
The sun-brown and the summer-gold are blowing;
But they shall gleam with spiritual glinter,
When paler beauty on your brows falls snowing,
And through those snows my looks shall be soft-going.
```
