## On Leaving London for Wales by Percy Bysshe Shelley

```
Hail to thee, Cambria! for the unfettered wind
Which from thy wilds even now methinks I feel,
Chasing the clouds that roll in wrath behind,
And tightening the soul's laxest nerves to steel;
True mountain Liberty alone may heal
The pain which Custom's obduracies bring,
And he who dares in fancy even to steal
One draught from Snowdon's ever sacred spring
Blots out the unholiest rede of worldly witnessing.

And shall that soul, to selfish peace resigned,
So soon forget the woe its fellows share?
Can Snowdon's Lethe from the free-born mind
So soon the page of injured penury tear?
Does this fine mass of human passion dare
To sleep, unhonouring the patriot's fall,
Or life's sweet load in quietude to bear
While millions famish even in Luxury's hall,
And Tyranny, high raised, stern lowers on all?

No, Cambria! never may thy matchless vales
A heart so false to hope and virtue shield;
Nor ever may thy spirit-breathing gales
Waft freshness to the slaves who dare to yield.
For me!...the weapon that I burn to wield
I seek amid thy rocks to ruin hurled,
That Reason's flag may over Freedom's field,
Symbol of bloodless victory, wave unfurled,
A meteor-sign of love effulgent o'er the world.

...

Do thou, wild Cambria, calm each struggling thought;
Cast thy sweet veil of rocks and woods between,
That by the soul to indignation wrought
Mountains and dells be mingled with the scene;
Let me forever be what I have been,
But not forever at my needy door
Let Misery linger speechless, pale and lean;
I am the friend of the unfriended poor,--
Let me not madly stain their righteous cause in gore.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

In terms of form, "On Leaving London for Wales" is a sonnet, consisting of fourteen lines. The poem follows a traditional Petrarchan (or Italian) sonnet structure, with an octave (the first eight lines) and a sestet (the final six lines). The rhyme scheme of the octave is ABBAABBA, while the sestet follows a more flexible pattern of CDCDCD.

The meter of the poem is primarily iambic pentameter, with five stressed syllables per line. This regular meter helps to create a sense of rhythm and flow throughout the poem, enhancing the impact of Shelley's words.

### Themes and Imagery

The poem explores themes of freedom, patriotism, social justice, and the power of nature. Shelley uses vivid imagery throughout the poem to convey these themes. For example, in the first stanza, he describes the wind from Wales as "chasing the clouds" and "tightening the soul's laxest nerves to steel," creating a sense of freedom and invigoration. The mention of Snowdon's "ever sacred spring" symbolizes purity and renewal.

The imagery of mountains and valleys in Wales symbolizes the rugged beauty of nature and the idea of freedom being found in wild, untamed landscapes. Shelley contrasts this with the image of "Millions famish even in Luxury's hall" to highlight the contrast between social inequality and the natural world.

### Literary Devices

Shelley employs several literary devices in the poem to enhance its meaning and impact. One example is the use of personification, as seen in lines like "And he who dares in fancy even to steal / One draught from Snowdon's ever sacred spring." This personification of Snowdon's spring gives it a sense of importance and sanctity.

The poem also contains alliteration, as in "True mountain Liberty alone may heal," which adds a musical quality to the verse. Additionally, the use of metaphor is evident in lines like "That Reason's flag may over Freedom's field," where Reason is compared to a flag symbolizing victory and freedom.

### Historical and Personal Context

Written during a time of political and social upheaval in Europe, Shelley's poem reflects his own revolutionary ideals and commitment to social justice. The poem was likely inspired by Shelley's own experiences and observations of the injustices and inequalities present in society.

Shelley's decision to leave London for Wales may have been influenced by his desire to escape the confines of urban life and connect with the natural world. The poem can be seen as a reflection of Shelley's belief in the transformative power of nature and the importance of fighting for freedom and justice.

### Deep Reading

In "On Leaving London for Wales," Shelley grapples with the tension between personal peace and social responsibility. The poem challenges the reader to consider the impact of indifference and complacency in the face of injustice. By choosing to seek solace in the mountains of Wales, Shelley suggests a desire to reinvigorate his commitment to the plight of the oppressed and marginalized.

The final lines of the poem emphasize Shelley's dedication to the cause of the poor and his rejection of violence as a means of achieving justice. Through his impassioned plea to "not madly stain their righteous cause in gore," Shelley advocates for a peaceful resolution to societal conflicts and a commitment to advocating for the rights of the downtrodden.

Overall, "On Leaving London for Wales" is a powerful exploration of the complexities of social conscience and personal integrity, urging the reader to consider their own role in combating injustice and standing up for the oppressed.

## From “Later Life” by Christina Rossetti

```
VI
We lack, yet cannot fix upon the lack:
Not this, nor that; yet somewhat, certainly.
We see the things we do not yearn to see
Around us: and what see we glancing back?
Lost hopes that leave our hearts upon the rack,
Hopes that were never ours yet seem’d to be,
For which we steer’d on life’s salt stormy sea
Braving the sunstroke and the frozen pack.
If thus to look behind is all in vain,
And all in vain to look to left or right,
Why face we not our future once again,
Launching with hardier hearts across the main,
Straining dim eyes to catch the invisible sight,
And strong to bear ourselves in patient pain?

IX
Star Sirius and the Pole Star dwell afar
Beyond the drawings each of other’s strength:
One blazes through the brief bright summer’s length
Lavishing life-heat from a flaming car;
While one unchangeable upon a throne
Broods o’er the frozen heart of earth alone,
Content to reign the bright particular star
Of some who wander or of some who groan.
They own no drawings each of other’s strength,
Nor vibrate in a visible sympathy,
Nor veer along their courses each toward
Yet are their orbits pitch’d in harmony
Of one dear heaven, across whose depth and length
Mayhap they talk together without speech.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

In terms of form, "From Later Life" by Christina Rossetti is comprised of two sections, VI and IX, each with its own distinct focus and imagery. The poem is written in a free verse form, without a consistent meter or rhyme scheme. This lack of formal structure mirrors the themes of uncertainty and searching for meaning within the poem.

### Themes and Imagery

One of the main themes of the poem is the idea of searching for something elusive and intangible. In section VI, Rossetti explores the idea of feeling a lack or absence in life, without being able to pinpoint exactly what it is. This is conveyed through the imagery of lost hopes and missed opportunities, symbolized by the metaphor of navigating "life’s salt stormy sea." The speaker reflects on the past with a sense of regret and longing, yet also questions why they do not have the courage to face the future with renewed hope and determination.

In section IX, the theme of distance and separation is explored through the imagery of the stars Sirius and the Pole Star. These celestial bodies are described as existing far apart from each other, yet still maintaining a sense of harmony and connection. This imagery reflects the idea of individuality and isolation, yet also hints at a deeper, unspoken connection that transcends physical distance.

### Literary Devices

Rossetti employs several literary devices throughout the poem to enhance its themes and imagery. In section VI, the use of paradoxical language such as "We lack, yet cannot fix upon the lack" conveys the speaker's sense of confusion and uncertainty. The repetition of the word "vain" in the lines "If thus to look behind is all in vain, / And all in vain to look to left or right" emphasizes the futility of dwelling on the past or present without taking action towards the future.

In section IX, the personification of the stars as having conversations "without speech" and existing in "harmony" despite their physical distance creates a sense of mystical connection and unity. The metaphor of the stars as representing different aspects of human experience adds depth to the themes of individuality and interconnectedness.

### Historical and Personal Context

Christina Rossetti was a Victorian poet known for her introspective and melancholic themes. "From Later Life" reflects Rossetti's own struggles with illness, loss, and spiritual searching. The poem captures the sense of existential questioning and longing for meaning that was prevalent in Victorian literature.

The imagery of the stars and the sea in the poem may also be influenced by Rossetti's deep religious beliefs. The idea of navigating life's stormy sea and seeking guidance from distant stars could be seen as a metaphor for seeking spiritual direction and purpose in a tumultuous world.

### Deep Reading

Overall, "From Later Life" by Christina Rossetti is a meditative exploration of longing, regret, and the search for meaning in a world filled with uncertainty. The poem's free verse form allows for a fluid expression of the speaker's inner thoughts and emotions, while the use of vivid imagery and literary devices adds depth and complexity to the themes of isolation, connection, and spiritual introspection.

Through the juxtaposition of the speaker's reflections on the past with their contemplation of the future, Rossetti invites readers to consider the importance of embracing change and facing the unknown with courage and resilience. The poem ultimately suggests that while life may be filled with unanswered questions and unfulfilled desires, there is still hope and possibility in moving forward with a "hardier heart" and a willingness to endure "patient pain" in pursuit of a brighter future.
