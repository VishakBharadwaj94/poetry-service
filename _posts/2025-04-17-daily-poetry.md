## Faith and Despondency by Emily Bronte

```
The winter wind is loud and wild,
Come close to me, my darling child;
Forsake thy books, and mateless play;
And, while the night is gathering grey,
We'll talk its pensive hours away;--

'Ierne, round our sheltered hall
November's gusts unheeded call;
Not one faint breath can enter here
Enough to wave my daughter's hair,
And I am glad to watch the blaze
Glance from her eyes, with mimic rays;
To feel her cheek so softly pressed,
In happy quiet on my breast.

'But, yet, even this tranquillity
Brings bitter, restless thoughts to me;
And, in the red fire's cheerful glow,
I think of deep glens, blocked with snow;
I dream of moor, and misty hill,
Where evening closes dark and chill;
For, lone, among the mountains cold,
Lie those that I have loved of old.
And my heart aches, in hopeless pain
Exhausted with repinings vain,
That I shall greet them ne'er again!'

'Father, in early infancy,
When you were far beyond the sea,
Such thoughts were tyrants over me!
I often sat, for hours together,
Through the long nights of angry weather,
Raised on my pillow, to descry
The dim moon struggling in the sky;

Or, with strained ear, to catch the shock,
Of rock with wave, and wave with rock;
So would I fearful vigil keep,
And, all for listening, never sleep.
But this world's life has much to dread,
Not so, my Father, with the dead.

'Oh! not for them, should we despair,
The grave is drear, but they are not there;
Their dust is mingled with the sod,
Their happy souls are gone to God!
You told me this, and yet you sigh,
And murmur that your friends must die.
Ah! my dear father, tell me why?

For, if your former words were true,
How useless would such sorrow be;
As wise, to mourn the seed which grew
Unnoticed on its parent tree,
Because it fell in fertile earth,
And sprang up to a glorious birth--
Struck deep its root, and lifted high
Its green boughs, in the breezy sky.

'But, I'll not fear, I will not weep
For those whose bodies rest in sleep,--
I know there is a blessed shore,
Opening its ports for me, and mine;
And, gazing Time's wide waters o'er,
I weary for that land divine,
Where we were born, where you and I
Shall meet our Dearest, when we die;
From suffering and corruption free,
Restored into the Deity.'

'Well hast thou spoken, sweet, trustful child!
And wiser than thy sire;
And worldly tempests, raging wild,
Shall strengthen thy desire--
Thy fervent hope, through storm and foam,
Through wind and ocean's roar,
To reach, at last, the eternal home,
The steadfast, changeless, shore!'
```

These personifications add depth to the imagery and evoke a sense of intimacy and connection. Additionally, the contrast between light and darkness, warmth and cold, in the imagery serves to highlight the dichotomy between despair and hope.

## Winter Song by Wilfred Owen

```
The browns, the olives, and the yellows died,
And were swept up to heaven; where they glowed
Each dawn and set of sun till Christmastide,
And when the land lay pale for them, pale-snowed,
Fell back, and down the snow-drifts flamed and flowed.

From off your face, into the winds of winter,
The sun-brown and the summer-gold are blowing;
But they shall gleam with spiritual glinter,
When paler beauty on your brows falls snowing,
And through those snows my looks shall be soft-going.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "Winter Song" by Wilfred Owen consists of three stanzas, each with a specific rhyme scheme of ABABCDCD. This rhyme scheme gives the poem a sense of fluidity and continuity, guiding the reader through the speaker's reflections on the changing seasons. The poem is written in iambic pentameter, with five stressed and unstressed syllables in each line, creating a rhythmic and melodic flow. The structured form of the poem reflects the cyclical nature of the seasons and the inevitability of change.

### Themes and Imagery

One of the central themes in "Winter Song" is the passage of time and the cycle of life and death. The imagery of the changing seasons, from the vibrant colors of autumn to the cold whiteness of winter, symbolizes the natural progression of life and the eventual decay that comes with it. The browns, olives, and yellows dying and being swept up to heaven represent the fleeting beauty of life and the inevitable transition into a colder, more barren existence.

The imagery of snow in the poem serves as a metaphor for purity and transformation. The snow falling on the land and on the speaker's beloved's brows symbolizes a cleansing and renewal, a stripping away of the old to make way for the new. The contrast between the warmth of summer and the coldness of winter highlights the dualities of life and the need for balance in all things.

### Literary Devices

Owen employs several literary devices in "Winter Song" to enhance the poem's themes and imagery. One example is personification, where the colors of autumn are described as dying and being swept up to heaven, giving them a sense of agency and movement. This personification adds depth to the poem's exploration of nature and its cycles.

Another literary device used is imagery, with vivid descriptions of the changing seasons and the impact they have on the landscape and the speaker's emotions. The use of contrasting colors, such as browns and yellows against pale snow, creates a visual contrast that mirrors the contrasts in life and the inevitability of change.

### Historical and Personal Context

Wilfred Owen was a British poet who served as a soldier in World War I, and his experiences in the war heavily influenced his poetry. While "Winter Song" does not directly reference war, Owen's personal context as a soldier likely shaped his views on life, death, and the passage of time. The themes of transition and transformation in the poem may reflect Owen's own struggles with the brutality of war and the fragility of life.

Additionally, Owen's use of nature imagery and seasonal motifs could be seen as a way to find solace and beauty in the midst of chaos and destruction. The poem's exploration of the natural world and its rhythms may serve as a form of escape or contemplation for Owen, allowing him to connect with something greater than himself.

### Deep Reading

On a deeper level, "Winter Song" can be interpreted as a meditation on the ephemeral nature of beauty and the inevitability of change. The speaker's reflections on the changing seasons and their impact on the landscape and his beloved suggest a sense of acceptance and resignation to the passage of time. The poem conveys a sense of melancholy and nostalgia for the past, while also acknowledging the potential for renewal and transformation in the future.

The repeated references to snow and its transformative power suggest a sense of rebirth and regeneration, highlighting the cyclical nature of life and the possibility of new beginnings. Ultimately, "Winter Song" invites the reader to reflect on the transient nature of life and the beauty that can be found in moments of change and transition.

## Why I am a Liberal by Robert Browning

```
"Why?" Because all I haply can and do,
  All that I am now, all I hope to be,--
  Whence comes it save from fortune setting free
Body and soul the purpose to pursue,
God traced for both? If fetters, not a few,
  Of prejudice, convention, fall from me,
  These shall I bid men--each in his degree
Also God-guided--bear, and gayly too?
  But little do or can the best of us:
That little is achieved thro' Liberty.
  Who then dares hold, emancipated thus,
His fellow shall continue bound? not I,
  Who live, love, labour freely, nor discuss
A brother's right to freedom. That is "Why."
```
