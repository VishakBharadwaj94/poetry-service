## The Night is Darkening Around Me by Emily Bronte

```
The night is darkening round me,
The wild winds coldly blow ;
But a tyrant spell has bound me,
And I cannot, cannot go.

The giant trees are bending
Their bare boughs weighed with snow ;
The storm is fast descending,
And yet I cannot go.

Clouds beyond clouds above me,
Wastes beyond wastes below ;
But nothing drear can move me :
I will not, cannot go.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

This poem by Emily Bronte consists of three stanzas, each with four lines. The rhyme scheme is AABB, meaning that the first and second lines rhyme with each other, as do the third and fourth lines in each stanza. This consistent rhyme scheme contributes to the poem's musical quality and helps to create a sense of unity and coherence throughout the piece. The meter is predominantly iambic tetrameter, with lines alternating between four stressed and unstressed syllables. This rhythmic pattern adds to the poem's flowing and lyrical quality, enhancing the overall reading experience.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem revolves around a feeling of entrapment and helplessness in the face of external forces. The speaker describes the encroaching darkness, cold winds, and approaching storm, creating a sense of foreboding and isolation. The imagery of the "wild winds coldly blow" and "giant trees bending" conveys a feeling of being overwhelmed by nature's power. Despite the external threats, the speaker feels paralyzed by an internal force, symbolized by the "tyrant spell" that binds them and prevents them from moving. This theme of being trapped, both physically and emotionally, resonates with feelings of inertia and resignation in the face of adversity.

### Literary Devices

Bronte employs several literary devices to enhance the poem's impact. The repetition of "cannot go" throughout the stanzas emphasizes the speaker's sense of immobility and reinforces the feeling of being trapped. The use of personification, such as the "tyrant spell" and the "storm descending," adds a sense of agency and malevolence to the natural elements, heightening the tension in the poem. The imagery of "bare boughs weighed with snow" and "Clouds beyond clouds above me" paints a vivid picture of a desolate and oppressive landscape, intensifying the mood of despair and confinement.

### Historical and Personal Context

Emily Bronte was known for her introspective and deeply emotional poetry, often exploring themes of nature, isolation, and mortality. As a member of the Bronte literary family, she was influenced by the Romantic movement and its emphasis on individual experience and emotional expression. The sense of confinement and resignation in this poem may reflect Bronte's own struggles with illness and isolation, as well as the societal constraints placed on women during the Victorian era. The imagery of the natural world as a menacing and oppressive force may also be a reflection of Bronte's own inner turmoil and sense of powerlessness.

### Deep Reading

On a deeper level, "The Night is Darkening Around Me" can be seen as a metaphor for the internal struggles and emotional barriers that we face in life. The external threats of the night, cold winds, and storm can be interpreted as representing the challenges and adversities that we encounter in our journey. The speaker's inability to move despite these threats symbolizes the paralysis and fear that often hold us back from confronting our fears and taking action. Ultimately, the poem conveys a sense of resignation and acceptance of one's limitations, while also hinting at the possibility of inner strength and resilience in the face of adversity.

## I. Peace by Rupert Brooke

```
Now, God be thanked Who has matched us with His hour,
And caught our youth, and wakened us from sleeping,
With hand made sure, clear eye, and sharpened power,
To turn, as swimmers into cleanness leaping,
Glad from a world grown old and cold and weary,
Leave the sick hearts that honour could not move,
And half-men, and their dirty songs and dreary,
And all the little emptiness of love!

Oh! we, who have known shame, we have found release there,
Where there's no ill, no grief, but sleep has mending,
Naught broken save this body, lost but breath;
Nothing to shake the laughing heart's long peace there
But only agony, and that has ending;
And the worst friend and enemy is but Death.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

It adheres to the traditional Shakespearean sonnet rhyme scheme of ABABCDCDEFEFGG. The meter is predominantly iambic pentameter, with five metrical feet per line. This regular structure adds a sense of stability and control to the poem, mirroring the theme of finding peace and release in the face of death.

The speaker expresses gratitude for being matched with their hour, referring to the time of their death. The imagery used throughout the poem is rich and vivid, evoking a sense of liberation and renewal. The imagery of swimming and leaping into cleanness symbolizes a fresh start and freedom from the burdens of the world. The contrast between the old, cold, and weary world and the new, clean, and peaceful afterlife creates a powerful depiction of the speaker's longing for tranquility.

### Literary Devices

Brooke employs several literary devices to enhance the poem's themes and imagery. The use of alliteration in phrases like "hand made sure" and "clear eye" creates a sense of clarity and precision. The repetition of the word "we" emphasizes the collective experience of finding release in death. The metaphor of swimming into cleanness symbolizes a purification of the soul. The personification of Death as both a friend and an enemy adds complexity to the speaker's relationship with mortality.

### Historical and Personal Context

Rupert Brooke was writing during a time of great upheaval and uncertainty, as World War I loomed on the horizon. This context likely influenced the poem's preoccupation with death and the desire for peace and release from suffering. Brooke himself served in the war and died at a young age, adding a personal dimension to his exploration of mortality and transcendence in his poetry.

### Deep Reading

On a deeper level, "I. Peace" can be seen as a meditation on the transient nature of life and the inevitability of death. The speaker's acceptance of death as a release from shame and suffering reflects a stoic resignation to the human condition. The poem suggests that true peace can only be found in death, where all earthly pains and sorrows are left behind. Despite the somber tone of the poem, there is a sense of tranquility and acceptance in the face of mortality, highlighting the speaker's journey towards inner peace and liberation.

## Holy-Cross Day by Robert Browning

```
Fee, faw, fum! bubble and squeak!
Blessedest Thursday's the fat of the week.
Rumble and tumble, sleek and rough,
Stinking and savoury, smug and gruff,
Take the church-road, for the bell's due chime
Gives us the summons--'tis sermon-time!

Boh, here's Barnabas! Job, that's you?
Up stumps Solomon--bustling too?
Shame, man! greedy beyond your years
To handsel the bishop's shaving-shears?
Fair play's a jewel! Leave friends in the lurch?
Stand on a line ere you start for the church!

Higgledy piggledy, packed we lie,
Rats in a hamper, swine in a stye,
Wasps in a bottle, frogs in a sieve,
Worms in a carcase, fleas in a sleeve.
Hist! square shoulders, settle your thumbs
And buzz for the bishop--here he comes.

Bow, wow, wow--a bone for the dog!
I liken his Grace to an acorned hog.
What, a boy at his side, with the bloom of a lass,
To help and handle my lord's hour-glass!
Didst ever behold so lithe a chine?
His cheek hath laps like a fresh-singed swine.

Aaron's asleep--shove hip to haunch,
Or somebody deal him a dig in the paunch!
Look at the purse with the tassel and knob
And the gown with the angel and thingumbob!
What's he at, quotha? reading his text!
Now you've his curtsey--and what comes next?

See to our converts--you doomed black dozen--
No stealing away--nor cog nor cozen!
You five, that were thieves, deserve it fairly;
You seven, that were beggars, will live less sparely;
You took your turn and dipped in the hat,
Got fortune--and fortune gets you; mind that!

Give your first groan--compunction's at work
And soft! from a Jew you mount to a Turk.
Lo, Micah,--the selfsame beard on chin
He was four times already converted in!
Here's a knife, clip quick--it's a sign of grace--
Or he ruins us all with his hanging-face.

Whom now is the bishop a-leering at?
I know a point where his text falls pat.
I'll tell him to-morrow, a word just now
Went to my heart and made me vow
I meddle no more with the worst of trades--
Let somebody else pay his serenades.

Groan all together now, whee-hee-hee!
It's a-work, it's a-work, ah, woe is me!
It began, when a herd of us, picked and placed,
Were spurred through the Corso, stripped to the waist;
Jew brutes, with sweat and blood well spent
To usher in worthily Christian Lent.

It grew, when the hangman entered our bounds,
Yelled, pricked us out to his church like hounds:
It got to a pitch, when the hand indeed
Which gutted my purse would throttle my creed:
And it overflows when, to even the odd,
Men I helped to their sins help me to their God.

But now, while the scapegoats leave our flock,
And the rest sit silent and count the clock,
Since forced to muse the appointed time
On these precious facts and truths sublime,
Let us fitly employ it, under our breath,
In saying Ben Ezra's Song of Death.

For Rabbi Ben Ezra, the night he died,
Called sons and sons' sons to his side,
And spoke, "This world has been harsh and strange;
Something is wrong: there needeth change.
But what, or where? at the last or first?
In one point only we sinned, at worst.

"The Lord will have mercy on Jacob yet,
And again in his border see Israel set.
When Judah beholds Jerusalem,
The stranger-seed shall be joined to them:
To Jacob's House shall the Gentiles cleave.
So the Prophet saith and his sons believe.

"Ay, the children of the chosen race
Shall carry and bring them to their place:
In the land of the Lord shall lead the same
Bondsmen and handmaids. Who shall blame,
When the slaves enslave, the oppressed ones o'er
The oppressor triumph for evermore?

"God spoke, and gave us the word to keep,
Bade never fold the hands nor sleep
'Mid a faithless world, at watch and ward,
Till Christ at the end relieve our guard.
By His servant Moses the watch was set:
Though near upon cock-crow, we keep it yet.

"Thou! if thou wast He, who at mid-watch came,
By the starlight, naming a dubious name!
And if, too heavy with sleep--too rash
With fear--O Thou, if that martyr-gash
Fell on Thee coming to take thine own,
And we gave the Cross, when we owed the Throne--

"Thou art the Judge. We are bruised thus.
But, the Judgment over,  join sides with us!
Thine too is the cause! and not more thine
Than ours, is the work of these dogs and swine,
Whose life laughs through and spits at their creed!
Who maintain Thee in word, and defy Thee in deed!

"We withstood Christ then? Be mindful how
At least we withstand Barabbas now!
Was our outrage sore? But the worst we spared,
To have called these--Christians, had we dared!
Let defiance to them pay mistrust of Thee,
And Rome make amends for Calvary!

"By the torture, prolonged from age to age,
By the infamy, Israel's heritage,
By the Ghetto's plague, by the garb's disgrace,
By the badge of shame, by the felon's place,
By the branding-tool, the bloody whip,
And the summons to Christian fellowship,--

"We boast our proof that at least the Jew
Would wrest Christ's name from the Devil's crew.
Thy face took never so deep a shade
But we fought them in it, God our aid!
A trophy to bear, as we march, thy band,
South, East, and on to the Pleasant Land!"
```
