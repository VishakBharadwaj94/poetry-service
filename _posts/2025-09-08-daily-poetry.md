## A Dead Rose by Elizabeth Barrett Browning

```
O Rose! who dares to name thee?
No longer roseate now, nor soft, nor sweet;
But pale, and hard, and dry, as stubble-wheat,---
Kept seven years in a drawer---thy titles shame thee.

The breeze that used to blow thee
Between the hedgerow thorns, and take away
An odour up the lane to last all day,---
If breathing now,---unsweetened would forego thee.

The sun that used to smite thee,
And mix his glory in thy gorgeous urn,
Till beam appeared to bloom, and flower to burn,---
If shining now,---with not a hue would light thee.

The dew that used to wet thee,
And, white first, grow incarnadined, because
It lay upon thee where the crimson was,---
If dropping now,---would darken where it met thee.

The fly that lit upon thee,
To stretch the tendrils of its tiny feet,
Along thy leaf's pure edges, after heat,---
If lighting now,---would coldly overrun thee.

The bee that once did suck thee,
And build thy perfumed ambers up his hive,
And swoon in thee for joy, till scarce alive,---
If passing now,---would blindly overlook thee.

The heart doth recognise thee,
Alone, alone! The heart doth smell thee sweet,
Doth view thee fair, doth judge thee most complete,---
Though seeing now those changes that disguise thee.

Yes, and the heart doth owe thee
More love, dead rose! than to such roses bold
As Julia wears at dances, smiling cold!---
Lie still upon this heart---which breaks below thee!
```

## In Memoriam (Easter, 1915) by Edward Thomas

```
THE flowers left thick at nightfall in the wood
This Eastertide call into mind the men,
Now far from home, who, with their sweethearts, should
Have gathered them and will do never again.

The use of enjambment, where the sentences continue from one line to the next without a pause, adds to the natural and conversational feel of the poem.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem revolves around remembrance and loss, particularly in the context of war. The speaker reflects on the absence of the men who should have been home with their sweethearts during Easter, but are now far away and will never return.

The use of Easter as a symbolic time of renewal and hope adds depth to the theme of loss, emphasizing the tragic disruption of normalcy and joy.

### Literary Devices

One of the key literary devices used in the poem is personification, where the flowers are described as "left thick at nightfall" and "call into mind the men."

The use of enjambment also creates a sense of continuity and fluidity in the poem, connecting the lines and ideas seamlessly.

The repetition of the word "never" in the line "and will do never again" emphasizes the finality and irrevocability of the loss, underscoring the tragic nature of war. Additionally, the use of imagery such as the wood and the sweethearts adds layers of meaning and emotion to the poem, inviting the reader to reflect on the impact of war on both individual lives and broader society.

## Too happy Time dissolves itself by Emily Dickinson

Too happy Time dissolves itself
And leaves no remnant by --
'Tis Anguish not a Feather hath
Or too much weight to fly --

### Historical and Personal Context

Emily Dickinson lived during the 19th century in Amherst, Massachusetts, and her poetry often explored themes of death, nature, and the passage of time.
