## Lines Written In Early Spring by William Wordsworth

```
I heard a thousand blended notes,
While in a grove I sate reclined,
In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts
Bring sad thoughts to the mind.

To her fair works did Nature link
The human soul that through me ran;
And much it grieved my heart to think
What man has made of man.

Through primrose tufts, in that green bower,
The periwinkle trailed its wreaths;
And 'tis my faith that every flower
Enjoys the air it breathes.

The birds around me hopped and played,
Their thoughts I cannot measure:--
But the least motion which they made
It seemed a thrill of pleasure.

The budding twigs spread out their fan,
To catch the breezy air;
And I must think, do all I can,
That there was pleasure there.

If this belief from heaven be sent,
If such be Nature's holy plan,
Have I not reason to lament
What man has made of man?
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme
"Lines Written In Early Spring" by William Wordsworth is a lyrical poem consisting of four quatrains with a rhyme scheme of ABAB. The meter is predominantly iambic tetrameter, with lines varying in length between seven and nine syllables. This irregularity in line length reflects the natural flow and rhythm of the speaker's thoughts as he contemplates nature. The use of enjambment, where sentences and phrases continue from one line to the next without punctuation, adds to the fluidity of the poem and enhances the sense of interconnectedness between the speaker and nature.

### Themes and Imagery
The central themes of the poem revolve around the beauty of nature, the relationship between man and nature, and the contrast between the purity of the natural world and the corruption of human society. Wordsworth uses vivid imagery to evoke the sights and sounds of spring, such as "primrose tufts," "periwinkle wreaths," and the birds "hopping and playing." The imagery of the budding twigs spreading out their fan to catch the breezy air symbolizes the joy and vitality of nature.

### Literary Devices
Wordsworth employs various literary devices throughout the poem to convey his message effectively. Personification is used when he suggests that flowers and birds experience pleasure, implying a deep connection between all living beings. The juxtaposition of "pleasant thoughts" and "sad thoughts" in the first stanza highlights the speaker's conflicting emotions and the duality of human experience. The repetition of the phrase "What man has made of man" emphasizes the speaker's lament for the detrimental impact of human actions on both nature and society.

### Historical and Personal Context
As a Romantic poet, Wordsworth was deeply influenced by the natural world and believed in the restorative power of nature. This poem reflects his belief in the spiritual connection between humanity and the environment, as well as his concern for the destructive tendencies of industrialization and urbanization during the early 19th century. Wordsworth's personal experiences of solitude in nature and his philosophical reflections on the importance of preserving the natural world are evident in the poem.

### Deep Reading
"Lines Written In Early Spring" delves into the complex relationship between humanity and the natural world, highlighting the speaker's sense of sorrow and disillusionment with the state of society. The contrast between the harmonious existence of nature and the destructive tendencies of humanity serves as a poignant reminder of the need for environmental stewardship and the preservation of the purity of the natural world. Through the speaker's introspective musings and observations of the beauty of spring, Wordsworth prompts readers to reflect on their own connection to nature and the impact of human actions on the environment. Ultimately, the poem serves as a call to reevaluate our relationship with the natural world and to strive for a more harmonious coexistence with the Earth.

## The Strayed Reveller by Matthew Arnold

```
1 Faster, faster,
2 O Circe, Goddess,
3 Let the wild, thronging train
4 The bright procession
5 Of eddying forms,
6 Sweep through my soul!

7 Thou standest, smiling
8 Down on me! thy right arm,
9 Lean'd up against the column there,
10 Props thy soft cheek;
11 Thy left holds, hanging loosely,
12 The deep cup, ivy-cinctured,
13 I held but now.

14 Is it, then, evening
15 So soon? I see, the night-dews,
16 Cluster'd in thick beads, dim
17 The agate brooch-stones
18 On thy white shoulder;
19 The cool night-wind, too,
20 Blows through the portico,
21 Stirs thy hair, Goddess,
22 Waves thy white robe!

Circe.

23 Whence art thou, sleeper?

The Youth.

24 When the white dawn first
25 Through the rough fir-planks
26 Of my hut, by the chestnuts,
27 Up at the valley-head,
28 Came breaking, Goddess!
29 I sprang up, I threw round me
30 My dappled fawn-skin;
31 Passing out, from the wet turf,
32 Where they lay, by the hut door,
33 I snatch'd up my vine-crown, my fir-staff,
34 All drench'd in dew-
35 Came swift down to join
36 The rout early gather'd
37 In the town, round the temple,
38 Iacchus' white fane
39 On yonder hill.

40 Quick I pass'd, following
41 The wood-cutters' cart-track
42 Down the dark valley;-I saw
43 On my left, through the beeches,
44 Thy palace, Goddess,
45 Smokeless, empty!
46 Trembling, I enter'd; beheld
47 The court all silent,
48 The lions sleeping,
49 On the altar this bowl.
50 I drank, Goddess!
51 And sank down here, sleeping,
52 On the steps of thy portico.

Circe.

53 Foolish boy! Why tremblest thou?
54 Thou lovest it, then, my wine?
55 Wouldst more of it? See, how glows,
56 Through the delicate, flush'd marble,
57 The red, creaming liquor,
58 Strown with dark seeds!
59 Drink, thee! I chide thee not,
60 Deny thee not my bowl.
61 Come, stretch forth thy hand, thee-so!
62 Drink-drink again!

The Youth.

63 Thanks, gracious one!
64 Ah, the sweet fumes again!
65 More soft, ah me,
66 More subtle-winding
67 Than Pan's flute-music!
68 Faint-faint! Ah me,
69 Again the sweet sleep!

Circe.

70 Hist! Thou-within there!
71 Come forth, Ulysses!
72 Art tired with hunting?
73 While we range the woodland,
74 See what the day brings.

Ulysses.

75 Ever new magic!
76 Hast thou then lured hither,
77 Wonderful Goddess, by thy art,
78 The young, languid-eyed Ampelus,
79 Iacchus' darling-
80 Or some youth beloved of Pan,
81 Of Pan and the Nymphs?
82 That he sits, bending downward
83 His white, delicate neck
84 To the ivy-wreathed marge
85 Of thy cup; the bright, glancing vine-leaves
86 That crown his hair,
87 Falling forward, mingling
88 With the dark ivy-plants--
89 His fawn-skin, half untied,
90 Smear'd with red wine-stains? Who is he,
91 That he sits, overweigh'd
92 By fumes of wine and sleep,
93 So late, in thy portico?
94 What youth, Goddess,-what guest
95 Of Gods or mortals?

Circe.

96 Hist! he wakes!
97 I lured him not hither, Ulysses.
98 Nay, ask him!

The Youth.

99 Who speaks' Ah, who comes forth
100 To thy side, Goddess, from within?
101 How shall I name him?
102 This spare, dark-featured,
103 Quick-eyed stranger?
104 Ah, and I see too
105 His sailor's bonnet,
106 His short coat, travel-tarnish'd,
107 With one arm bare!--
108 Art thou not he, whom fame
109 This long time rumours
110 The favour'd guest of Circe, brought by the waves?
111 Art thou he, stranger?
112 The wise Ulysses,
113 Laertes' son?

Ulysses.

114 I am Ulysses.
115 And thou, too, sleeper?
116 Thy voice is sweet.
117 It may be thou hast follow'd
118 Through the islands some divine bard,
119 By age taught many things,
120 Age and the Muses;
121 And heard him delighting
122 The chiefs and people
123 In the banquet, and learn'd his songs.
124 Of Gods and Heroes,
125 Of war and arts,
126 And peopled cities,
127 Inland, or built
128 By the gray sea.-If so, then hail!
129 I honour and welcome thee.

The Youth.

130 The Gods are happy.
131 They turn on all sides
132 Their shining eyes,
133 And see below them
134 The earth and men.

135 They see Tiresias
136 Sitting, staff in hand,
137 On the warm, grassy
138 Asopus bank,
139 His robe drawn over
140 His old sightless head,
141 Revolving inly
142 The doom of Thebes.

143 They see the Centaurs
144 In the upper glens
145 Of Pelion, in the streams,
146 Where red-berried ashes fringe
147 The clear-brown shallow pools,
148 With streaming flanks, and heads
149 Rear'd proudly, snuffing
150 The mountain wind.

151 They see the Indian
152 Drifting, knife in hand,
153 His frail boat moor'd to
154 A floating isle thick-matted
155 With large-leaved, low-creeping melon-plants
156 And the dark cucumber.

157 He reaps, and stows them,
158 Drifting--drifting;--round him,
159 Round his green harvest-plot,
160 Flow the cool lake-waves,
161 The mountains ring them.

162 They see the Scythian
163 On the wide stepp, unharnessing
164 His wheel'd house at noon.
165 He tethers his beast down, and makes his meal--
166 Mares' milk, and bread
167 Baked on the embers;--all around
168 The boundless, waving grass-plains stretch, thick-starr'd
169 With saffron and the yellow hollyhock
170 And flag-leaved iris-flowers.
171 Sitting in his cart
172 He makes his meal; before him, for long miles,
173 Alive with bright green lizards,
174 And the springing bustard-fowl,
175 The track, a straight black line,
176 Furrows the rich soil; here and there
177 Cluster of lonely mounds
178 Topp'd with rough-hewn,
179 Gray, rain-blear'd statues, overpeer
180 The sunny waste.

181 They see the ferry
182 On the broad, clay-laden
183 Lone Chorasmian stream;--thereon,
184 With snort and strain,
185 Two horses, strongly swimming, tow
186 The ferry-boat, with woven ropes
187 To either bow
188 Firm harness'd by the mane; a chief
189 With shout and shaken spear,
190 Stands at the prow, and guides them; but astern
191 The cowering merchants, in long robes,
192 Sit pale beside their wealth
193 Of silk-bales and of balsam-drops,
194 Of gold and ivory,
195 Of turquoise-earth and amethyst,
196 Jasper and chalcedony,
197 And milk-barred onyx-stones.
198 The loaded boat swings groaning
199 In the yellow eddies;
200 The Gods behold him.

201 They see the Heroes
202 Sitting in the dark ship
203 On the foamless, long-heaving
204 Violet sea.
205 At sunset nearing
206 The Happy Islands.

207 These things, Ulysses,
208 The wise bards, also
209 Behold and sing.
210 But oh, what labour!
211 O prince, what pain!
212 They too can see
213 Tiresias;--but the Gods,
214 Who give them vision,
215 Added this law:
216 That they should bear too
217 His groping blindness,
218 His dark foreboding,
219 His scorn'd white hairs;
220 Bear Hera's anger
221 Through a life lengthen'd
222 To seven ages.

223 They see the Centaurs
224 On Pelion:--then they feel,
225 They too, the maddening wine
226 Swell their large veins to bursting; in wild pain
227 They feel the biting spears
228 Of the grim Lapithж, and Theseus, drive,
229 Drive crashing through their bones; they feel
230 High on a jutting rock in the red stream
231 Alcmena's dreadful son
232 Ply his bow;--such a price
233 The Gods exact for song:
234 To become what we sing.

235 They see the Indian
236 On his mountain lake; but squalls
237 Make their skiff reel, and worms
238 In the unkind spring have gnawn
239 Their melon-harvest to the heart.--They see
240 The Scythian: but long frosts
241 Parch them in winter-time on the bare stepp,
242 Till they too fade like grass; they crawl
243 Like shadows forth in spring.

244 They see the merchants
245 On the Oxus stream;--but care
246 Must visit first them too, and make them pale.
247 Whether, through whirling sand,
248 A cloud of desert robber-horse have burst
249 Upon their caravan; or greedy kings,
250 In the wall'd cities the way passes through,
251 Crush'd them with tolls; or fever-airs,
252 On some great river's marge,
253 Mown them down, far from home.

254 They see the Heroes
255 Near harbour;--but they share
256 Their lives, and former violent toil in Thebes,
257 Seven-gated Thebes, or Troy;
258 Or where the echoing oars
259 Of Argo first
260 Startled the unknown sea.

261 The old Silenus
262 Came, lolling in the sunshine,
263 From the dewy forest-coverts,
264 This way at noon.
265 Sitting by me, while his Fauns
266 Down at the water-side
267 Sprinkled and smoothed
268 His drooping garland,
269 He told me these things.

270 But I, Ulysses,
271 Sitting on the warm steps,
272 Looking over the valley,
273 All day long, have seen,
274 Without pain, without labour,
275 Sometimes a wild-hair'd Mжnad--
276 Sometimes a Faun with torches--
277 And sometimes, for a moment,
278 Passing through the dark stems
279 Flowing-robed, the beloved,
280 The desired, the divine,
281 Beloved Iacchus.

282 Ah, cool night-wind, tremulous stars!
283 Ah, glimmering water,
284 Fitful earth-murmur,
285 Dreaming woods!
286 Ah, golden-haired, strangely smiling Goddess,
287 And thou, proved, much enduring,
288 Wave-toss'd Wanderer!
289 Who can stand still?
290 Ye fade, ye swim, ye waver before me--
291 The cup again!

292 Faster, faster,
293 O Circe, Goddess.
294 Let the wild, thronging train,
295 The bright procession
296 Of eddying forms,
297 Sweep through my soul!
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

"The Strayed Reveller" by Matthew Arnold is written in free verse, which allows the poet to convey a sense of wandering and unrestrained thought. The poem is divided into three distinct sections: the speaker's encounter with Circe, Ulysses' arrival, and the youth's visions. Each section is marked by a shift in perspective and tone, creating a dynamic structure that mirrors the wandering nature of the speaker's thoughts.

The poem does not adhere to a strict meter or rhyme scheme, further emphasizing the sense of freedom and spontaneity in the speaker's musings. This lack of formal structure allows Arnold to explore complex themes and imagery without being constrained by traditional poetic conventions.

### Themes and Imagery

One of the central themes of the poem is the allure of escapism and the temptation of indulgence. The speaker is drawn into a dreamlike state by Circe's wine, symbolizing a desire to escape from reality and surrender to pleasure. The imagery of the wild, thronging train and the bright procession of eddying forms sweeping through the speaker's soul conveys a sense of intoxication and abandon.

The poem also explores the idea of transformation and the consequences of indulgence. Circe's seductive offer of wine leads to a loss of control and a surrender to sleep, symbolizing a loss of agency and self-awareness. The youth's visions of mythical figures and distant lands further emphasize the theme of escapism and the transformative power of imagination.

### Literary Devices

Arnold employs a variety of literary devices to enhance the themes and imagery of the poem. The use of vivid sensory imagery, such as the night-dews clustering in thick beads and the cool night-wind blowing through the portico, creates a dreamlike atmosphere that immerses the reader in the speaker's experience.

The repetition of the phrase "faster, faster" throughout the poem serves to emphasize the speaker's sense of urgency and desire for escape. The allusions to Greek mythology, such as Circe and Ulysses, add depth and complexity to the poem, inviting readers to explore themes of temptation, transformation, and the consequences of indulgence.

### Historical and Personal Context

Matthew Arnold was a Victorian poet and critic known for his contemplative and introspective poetry. "The Strayed Reveller" reflects Arnold's interest in classical mythology and his exploration of themes such as escapism, self-discovery, and the conflict between reason and emotion.

The poem can also be seen as a reflection of Arnold's own struggles with identity and the pressures of Victorian society. The speaker's desire to escape into a world of fantasy and indulgence may reflect Arnold's own longing for freedom and self-expression in a society that valued conformity and restraint.

### Deep Reading

At its core, "The Strayed Reveller" can be seen as a meditation on the human desire for transcendence and the tension between reality and fantasy. The speaker's encounter with Circe and his subsequent visions symbolize a longing for a deeper connection to the divine and the ineffable.

The poem raises questions about the nature of truth and illusion, as well as the consequences of indulging in escapism. The youth's visions of mythical figures and distant lands serve as a reminder of the power of imagination to transport us beyond the limitations of our everyday lives.

Overall, "The Strayed Reveller" invites readers to contemplate the complexities of human experience and the eternal search for meaning and connection in a world filled with temptation and distraction.

## It Was upon by Edward Thomas

```
IT was upon a July evening.
At a stile I stood, looking along a path
Over the country by a second Spring
Drenched perfect green again. "The lattermath
Will be a fine one." So the stranger said,
A wandering man. Albeit I stood at rest,
Flushed with desire I was. The earth outspread,
Like meadows of the future, I possessed.

And as an unaccomplished prophecy
The stranger's words, after the interval
Of a score years, when those fields are by me
Never to be recrossed, now I recall,
This July eve, and question, wondering,
What of the lattermath to this hoar Spring?
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "It Was upon" by Edward Thomas consists of a single stanza with a total of fourteen lines. It follows a free verse form, lacking a specific rhyme scheme or meter. This lack of formal structure contributes to the poem's conversational and contemplative tone. The enjambment in the poem, particularly seen in lines 3 and 4, creates a sense of flow and continuity, mirroring the speaker's thoughts as they reflect on the passing of time.

### Themes and Imagery

One of the central themes of the poem is the passage of time and the inevitability of change. The speaker reflects on a moment from the past, where a stranger made a comment about the future state of the fields. This moment becomes a point of contemplation for the speaker as they consider the passing of years and the uncertainty of what the future holds. The imagery of the "perfect green" of the second Spring symbolizes renewal and growth, contrasting with the speaker's aging and questioning of what lies ahead.

### Literary Devices

Thomas employs various literary devices to convey the themes of the poem. The use of personification is evident in lines like "Flushed with desire I was" and "The earth outspread," where human emotions and characteristics are attributed to nature. The metaphor of the "meadows of the future" emphasizes the speaker's ownership and anticipation of what is to come. Additionally, the repetition of the word "lattermath" serves to emphasize its significance in the speaker's reflections on time and memory.

### Historical and Personal Context

Edward Thomas was writing during a time of great change and uncertainty, as World War I loomed on the horizon. This historical context likely influenced his themes of time, memory, and the transient nature of life. Personally, Thomas struggled with his own sense of identity and purpose, which is reflected in the speaker's contemplation of the passing years and the unknown future. The poem can be seen as a reflection on mortality and the fleeting nature of human experience.

### Deep Reading

At its core, "It Was upon" delves into the intricacies of memory and the ways in which the past shapes our understanding of the present and future. The speaker's recollection of the stranger's words from years ago serves as a lens through which they question the course of their own life. The juxtaposition of the vibrant imagery of nature with the speaker's introspective musings creates a sense of tension between the external world and internal reflections. Ultimately, the poem invites readers to consider their own relationship to time, memory, and the passage of years.
