## Come hither, child by Emily Bronte

```
Come hither, child--who gifted thee
With power to touch that string so well?
How darest thou rouse up thoughts in me,
Thoughts that I would--but cannot quell?

Nay, chide not, lady; long ago
I heard those notes in Ula's hall,
And had I known they'd waken woe
I'd weep their music to recall.

But thus it was: one festal night
When I was hardly six years old
I stole away from crowds and light
And sought a chamber dark and cold.

I had no one to love me there,
I knew no comrade and no friend;
And so I went to sorrow where
Heaven, only heaven saw me bend.

Loud blew the wind; 'twas sad to stay
From all that splendour barred away.
I imaged in the lonely room
A thousand forms of fearful gloom.

And with my wet eyes raised on high
I prayed to God that I might die.
Suddenly in that silence drear
A sound of music reached my ear,

And then a note, I hear it yet,
So full of soul, so deeply sweet,
I thought that Gabriel's self had come
To take me to thy father's home.

Three times it rose, that seraph strain,
Then died, nor breathed again;
But still the words and still the tone
Dwell round my heart when all alone.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme
Emily Bronte's poem "Come hither, child" consists of four stanzas, each with seven lines. The rhyme scheme is AABBCCD, giving the poem a lyrical and musical quality. The meter is primarily iambic tetrameter, with four metrical feet per line, creating a steady rhythm throughout the poem. This structured form enhances the emotional impact of the poem as it unfolds.

### Themes and Imagery
One of the central themes of the poem is loneliness and longing for connection. The speaker, a child, seeks solace in music when faced with isolation and sorrow. The imagery in the poem is vivid and emotive, evoking a sense of desolation ("sought a chamber dark and cold"), yearning ("I had no one to love me there"), and spiritual transcendence ("I prayed to God that I might die"). The image of the child alone in a dark room, surrounded by fearful gloom, contrasts sharply with the comforting and angelic quality of the music that ultimately brings solace.

### Literary Devices
Bronte employs several literary devices to enhance the emotional depth of the poem. The use of imagery, such as "forms of fearful gloom" and "wet eyes raised on high," creates a poignant atmosphere. The repetition of the word "heaven" emphasizes the speaker's sense of isolation and longing for divine intervention. Additionally, the personification of music as a seraphic being ("I thought that Gabriel's self had come") adds a mystical and transcendent quality to the poem.

### Historical and Personal Context
Emily Bronte, known for her introspective and emotive poetry, often explored themes of isolation, nature, and spirituality in her works. As a member of the romantic literary movement, Bronte's poetry reflects the era's fascination with individual experience and emotion. The personal context of the poem likely draws from Bronte's own experiences of solitude and longing, infusing the poem with a sense of authenticity and raw emotion.

### Deep Reading
On a deeper level, "Come hither, child" can be seen as a reflection on the power of art and music to transcend suffering and provide solace in times of despair. The child's experience of finding comfort in music amidst loneliness and darkness speaks to the universal human need for connection and transcendence. The angelic quality of the music symbolizes a moment of divine grace and spiritual awakening for the speaker, offering a glimpse of hope and beauty in the midst of sorrow. Ultimately, the poem conveys a message of resilience and the transformative power of art to heal and uplift the soul.

## Romance by Edgar Allan Poe

```
Romance, who loves to nod and sing,
With drowsy head and folded wing,
Among the green leaves as they shake
Far down within some shadowy lake,
To me a painted paroquet
Hath been--a most familiar bird--
Taught me my alphabet to say--
To lisp my very earliest word
While in the wild wood I did lie,
A child--with a most knowing eye.

Of late, eternal Condor years
So shake the very Heaven on high
With tumult as they thunder by,
I have no time for idle cares
Though gazing on the unquiet sky.
And when an hour with calmer wings
Its down upon my spirit flings--
That little time with lyre and rhyme
To while away--forbidden things!
My heart would feel to be a crime
Unless it trembled with the strings.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

In terms of form, this poem consists of two stanzas, with the first stanza having eight lines and the second stanza having six lines. The rhyme scheme in the first stanza is ABABCDCD, while the second stanza follows a similar pattern with ABABC. The poem is written in iambic tetrameter, with four metrical feet per line. This gives the poem a rhythmic and musical quality, enhancing the lyrical nature of the verses.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem "Romance" by Edgar Allan Poe is the contrast between the innocence and wonder of childhood and the harsh realities of adulthood. The speaker reflects on a time when they were enchanted by the beauty of nature, symbolized by the "painted paroquet" and the "green leaves." However, as time passes ("eternal Condor years"), the speaker becomes preoccupied with the burdens and responsibilities of life, represented by the "tumult" and "unquiet sky."

The imagery in the poem is vivid and evocative, creating a sense of nostalgia and longing. The image of the "painted paroquet" teaching the speaker their alphabet and first words conveys a sense of innocence and simplicity. In contrast, the image of the "eternal Condor years" shaking the heavens with thunder suggests a feeling of overwhelming chaos and strife. The juxtaposition of these images highlights the passage of time and the loss of childhood innocence.

### Literary Devices

Poe employs several literary devices in the poem to enhance its meaning and emotional impact. One of the key devices used is personification, as the concept of Romance is personified as a bird with human-like qualities. This personification adds a sense of whimsy and fantasy to the poem. Additionally, there is imagery, such as the "shadowy lake" and the "wild wood," which creates a vivid picture of nature and childhood innocence.

The poem also features alliteration, as seen in the phrases "drowsy head," "folded wing," and "wild wood," which create a musical quality and enhance the flow of the verses. The use of symbolism is evident in the contrasting symbols of the "painted paroquet" and the "eternal Condor years," which represent innocence and experience, respectively.

### Historical and Personal Context

During the time when Poe was writing, there was a growing interest in Romanticism, a literary movement that emphasized emotion, imagination, and nature. This poem reflects some of the key themes of Romanticism, such as a fascination with nature, a sense of nostalgia for the past, and a longing for innocence and simplicity. Poe's personal struggles with loss and grief may have influenced the themes of the poem, as he often explored themes of death, loss, and the passage of time in his works.

### Deep Reading

On a deeper level, "Romance" can be seen as a meditation on the fleeting nature of innocence and the inevitability of growing up. The speaker's reminiscence of a time when they were taught by a bird in the woods contrasts sharply with their current state of being overwhelmed by the chaos of life. The poem suggests that the pursuit of "forbidden things" such as art and creativity is a necessary rebellion against the harsh realities of adulthood.

Overall, "Romance" by Edgar Allan Poe is a poignant reflection on the loss of childhood innocence and the struggle to maintain a sense of wonder and imagination in the face of life's challenges. Through vivid imagery, lyrical language, and deep themes, Poe captures the bittersweet essence of growing up and the enduring power of the human spirit to find beauty and meaning in the world.

## Gone, Gone Again by Edward Thomas

```
GONE, gone again,
May, June, July,
And August gone,
Again gone by,

Not memorable
Save that I saw them go,
As past the empty quays
The rivers flow.

And now again,
In the harvest rain,
The Blenheim oranges
Fall grubby from the trees,

As when I was young--
And when the lost one was here--
And when the war began
To turn young men to dung.

Look at the old house,
Outmoded, dignified,
Dark and untenanted,
With grass growing instead

Of the footsteps of life,
The friendliness, the strife;
In its beds have lain
Youth, love, age and pain:

I am something like that;
Only I am not dead,
Still breathing and interested
In the house that is not dark:--

I am something like that:
Not one pane to reflect the sun,
For the schoolboys to throw at--
They have broken every one.
```
