## Common Things by Paul Laurence Dunbar

```
I like to hear of wealth and gold,
And El Doradoes in their glory;
I like for silks and satins bold
To sweep and rustle through a story.

The nightingale is sweet of song;
The rare exotic smells divinely;
And knightly men who stride along,
The role heroic carry finely.

But then, upon the other hand,
Our minds have got a way of running
To things that aren't quite so grand,
Which, maybe, we are best in shunning.

For some of us still like to see
The poor man in his dwelling narrow,
The hollyhock, the bumblebee,
The meadow lark, and chirping sparrow.

We like the man who soars and sings
With high and lofty inspiration;
But he who sings of common things
Shall always share our admiration.
```

### Themes and Imagery

The overarching theme of the poem revolves around the contrast between the grandeur of wealth and luxury versus the beauty and value of simplicity and common things. The speaker expresses a preference for the latter, emphasizing the importance of appreciating the ordinary and mundane aspects of life. Through vivid imagery, Dunbar paints a picture of opulence with references to wealth, nightingales, exotic scents, and heroic figures, juxtaposed with images of everyday life like the poor man's dwelling, hollyhocks, bumblebees, and sparrows. This contrast highlights the beauty found in simplicity and commonality.

### Literary Devices

Dunbar employs several literary devices to convey his message effectively. The use of alliteration, as seen in "silks and satins bold" and "soars and sings," adds a musical quality to the poem. The repetition of the word "like" throughout the poem emphasizes the speaker's preferences and creates a sense of continuity. Additionally, the use of juxtaposition, contrasting grandeur with simplicity, serves to underscore the poem's central theme.

### Historical and Personal Context

Paul Laurence Dunbar, an African American poet, often explored themes of race, identity, and societal inequalities in his work.

Through this perspective, Dunbar invites readers to reassess their priorities and appreciate the often overlooked beauty of the world around them.

## Somewhat, to hope for, by Emily Dickinson

```
Somewhat, to hope for,
Be it ne'er so far
Is Capital against Despair --

Somewhat, to suffer,
Be it ne'er so keen --
If terminable, may be borne.
```

Given Dickinson's own struggles with mental health and personal isolation, it is likely that she drew from her own experiences when writing about the power of hope and resilience.

This repetition serves to emphasize the importance of these abstract concepts in shaping our emotional and mental well-being. Overall, the poem encourages readers to hold onto hope in the face of adversity and reminds them of the temporary nature of suffering.

## From “Later Life” by Christina Rossetti

```
VI
We lack, yet cannot fix upon the lack:
Not this, nor that; yet somewhat, certainly.
We see the things we do not yearn to see
Around us: and what see we glancing back?
Lost hopes that leave our hearts upon the rack,
Hopes that were never ours yet seem’d to be,
For which we steer’d on life’s salt stormy sea
Braving the sunstroke and the frozen pack.
If thus to look behind is all in vain,
And all in vain to look to left or right,
Why face we not our future once again,
Launching with hardier hearts across the main,
Straining dim eyes to catch the invisible sight,
And strong to bear ourselves in patient pain?

IX
Star Sirius and the Pole Star dwell afar
Beyond the drawings each of other’s strength:
One blazes through the brief bright summer’s length
Lavishing life-heat from a flaming car;
While one unchangeable upon a throne
Broods o’er the frozen heart of earth alone,
Content to reign the bright particular star
Of some who wander or of some who groan.
They own no drawings each of other’s strength,
Nor vibrate in a visible sympathy,
Nor veer along their courses each toward
Yet are their orbits pitch’d in harmony
Of one dear heaven, across whose depth and length
Mayhap they talk together without speech.
```
