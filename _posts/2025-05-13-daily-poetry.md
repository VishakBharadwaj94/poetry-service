## Later life by Christina Rossetti

```
Something this foggy day, a something which
Is neither of this fog nor of today,
Has set me dreaming of the winds that play
Past certain cliffs, along one certain beach,
And turn the topmost edge of waves to spray:
Ah pleasant pebbly strand so far away,
So out of reach while quite within my reach,
As out of reach as India or Cathay!
I am sick of where I am and where I am not,
I am sick of foresight and of memory,
I am sick of all I have and all I see,
I am sick of self, and there is nothing new;
Oh weary impatient patience of my lot!
Thus with myself: how fares it, Friends, with you?
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

In terms of form, Christina Rossetti's poem "Later life" consists of a single stanza of fourteen lines. The poem follows a traditional form known as a Petrarchan sonnet, which typically consists of an octave (the first eight lines) followed by a sestet (the final six lines). However, in this case, Rossetti modifies the form by keeping all fourteen lines in one stanza. The poem is written in iambic pentameter, with lines having ten syllables each, creating a rhythmic flow. 

The rhyme scheme of the poem is ABBAABBA CDCDCD, which is typical of a Petrarchan sonnet. This rhyme scheme helps to create a sense of unity and cohesion within the poem, as the alternating rhyme scheme in the octave and the sestet mirrors the speaker's conflicting emotions and desires.

### Themes and Imagery

The central themes of "Later life" revolve around longing, dissatisfaction, and a sense of yearning for something unattainable. The speaker expresses a deep dissatisfaction with their current circumstances and a longing for distant and unattainable places, such as "India or Cathay." The imagery of the "pleasant pebbly strand" and the winds playing along the beach evoke a sense of nostalgia and longing for a place that is both familiar and out of reach.

The foggy day serves as a metaphor for the speaker's state of mind, clouded by discontent and restlessness. The contrast between the physical fog and the mental fog of the speaker's emotions adds depth to the imagery, highlighting the speaker's internal conflict.

### Literary Devices

Rossetti employs several literary devices in "Later life" to enhance the poem's themes and imagery. The repetition of the word "sick" in lines 7-10 creates a sense of weariness and discontent, emphasizing the speaker's dissatisfaction with their current state. The use of enjambment throughout the poem, such as in lines 2-3 and 5-6, creates a flowing and uninterrupted rhythm, mirroring the speaker's continuous stream of thoughts and emotions.

The use of simile in line 4, comparing the winds to a certain beach, adds a layer of specificity to the imagery, emphasizing the speaker's longing for a particular place. The allusion to India and Cathay in line 9 further enhances the sense of distance and unattainability that the speaker feels.

### Historical and Personal Context

Christina Rossetti was a Victorian poet known for her introspective and melancholic themes. As a devout Christian, many of her poems explore themes of faith, love, and death. "Later life" reflects Rossetti's own struggles with illness and depression, as well as her desire for spiritual fulfillment. The poem's themes of dissatisfaction and yearning for something beyond reach are reflective of the societal constraints placed on women during the Victorian era, as well as Rossetti's personal struggles with her own mental and physical health.

### Deep Reading

At its core, "Later life" delves into the universal human experience of longing and dissatisfaction. The speaker's restlessness and yearning for something beyond their current circumstances resonate with readers who have experienced similar feelings of discontent and longing. The paradox of feeling both within reach and out of reach at the same time highlights the speaker's internal conflict and the complexities of human desire.

The closing question, "how fares it, Friends, with you?" serves as a poignant reminder of the speaker's isolation and longing for connection. Despite expressing a sense of weariness with themselves and their surroundings, the speaker reaches out to others, seeking solace and understanding. This final line encapsulates the overarching theme of human connection and the shared experience of longing and discontent.

## Hayeswater by Matthew Arnold

```
A region desolate and wild.
Black, chafing water: and afloat,
And lonely as a truant child
In a waste wood, a single boat:
No mast, no sails are set thereon;
It moves, but never moveth on:
And welters like a human thing
Amid the wild waves weltering.

Behind, a buried vale doth sleep,
Far down the torrent cleaves its way:
In front the dumb rock rises steep,
A fretted wall of blue and grey;
Of shooting cliff and crumbled stone
With many a wild weed overgrown:
All else, black water: and afloat,
One rood from shore, that single boat.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "Hayeswater" by Matthew Arnold is written in a structured form with a consistent rhyme scheme of ABAB. Each stanza consists of four lines, with the first and third lines rhyming, as well as the second and fourth lines. This rhyme scheme creates a sense of unity and cohesion throughout the poem. The meter is mostly iambic tetrameter, with four metrical feet in each line, giving the poem a rhythmic and flowing quality. 

The structured form of the poem reflects the sense of order and control in contrast to the desolate and wild landscape described in the verses. The consistent rhyme scheme and meter contribute to the overall musicality of the poem, enhancing the reader's experience and drawing them into the scene depicted.

### Themes and Imagery

The central themes in "Hayeswater" revolve around desolation, loneliness, and the relentless passage of time. The poem paints a vivid picture of a barren and wild landscape, with imagery that evokes a sense of isolation and abandonment. The description of the "region desolate and wild" sets the tone for the rest of the poem, emphasizing the bleakness of the setting.

The imagery of the "black, chafing water" and the "lonely" boat adrift in the lake conveys a feeling of solitude and aimlessness. The boat, with "no mast, no sails," symbolizes a lack of direction and purpose, mirroring the sense of disorientation and stagnation in the natural world. The description of the "buried vale" and the "dumb rock" further accentuates the sense of stillness and quietness that pervades the scene.

### Literary Devices

Arnold employs several literary devices in "Hayeswater" to enhance the imagery and themes of the poem. One notable device is personification, as seen in the line "And welters like a human thing / Amid the wild waves weltering." Here, the water is likened to a human being, emphasizing its tumultuous and restless nature.

Another literary device used in the poem is alliteration, as in the line "A fretted wall of blue and grey," where the repetition of the "w" sound creates a sense of harshness and roughness in the description of the rock face. Additionally, Arnold employs imagery and symbolism to convey the desolation and emptiness of the landscape, using vivid descriptions to evoke a sense of isolation and abandonment.

### Historical and Personal Context

Matthew Arnold was a Victorian poet known for his introspective and philosophical works. "Hayeswater" was written during a period of social and political change in England, as the industrial revolution transformed the landscape and society. The poem reflects Arnold's concerns about the impact of modernity on the natural world and the human spirit, highlighting the loss of connection to the wilderness and the sense of alienation that came with industrialization.

Arnold's personal experiences and reflections on nature and society likely influenced the themes and imagery in "Hayeswater," as he grappled with questions of identity, purpose, and the human condition in a rapidly changing world. The poem can be seen as a meditation on the transience of life and the search for meaning in a world that seems increasingly fragmented and disconnected.

### Deep Reading

At its core, "Hayeswater" is a meditation on the passage of time and the inevitability of change. The stagnant boat on the lake symbolizes the human experience of feeling stuck or adrift in a world that is constantly in motion. The juxtaposition of the barren landscape with the restless water underscores the contrast between stillness and movement, highlighting the tension between stasis and change.

The buried vale and the rising rock wall suggest layers of history and memory that are hidden beneath the surface, hinting at the complexity and depth of the natural world. Arnold's use of vivid imagery and evocative language invites readers to contemplate the beauty and harshness of the wilderness, prompting reflection on their own place in the grand scheme of existence.

Overall, "Hayeswater" invites readers to pause and reflect on the timeless themes of nature, solitude, and the human experience, prompting a deeper exploration of the mysteries and wonders of the world around us.

## Common Things by Paul Laurence Dunbar

```
I like to hear of wealth and gold,
And El Doradoes in their glory;
I like for silks and satins bold
To sweep and rustle through a story.

The nightingale is sweet of song;
The rare exotic smells divinely;
And knightly men who stride along,
The role heroic carry finely.

But then, upon the other hand,
Our minds have got a way of running
To things that aren't quite so grand,
Which, maybe, we are best in shunning.

For some of us still like to see
The poor man in his dwelling narrow,
The hollyhock, the bumblebee,
The meadow lark, and chirping sparrow.

We like the man who soars and sings
With high and lofty inspiration;
But he who sings of common things
Shall always share our admiration.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

In terms of form, "Common Things" by Paul Laurence Dunbar is a lyric poem consisting of three stanzas with varying line lengths. The first stanza has six lines, the second stanza has eight lines, and the final stanza has seven lines. The poem follows a consistent rhyme scheme of AABBCCDD for the first stanza, ABABCDCD for the second stanza, and ABCCBDD for the final stanza. This regular rhyme scheme contributes to the poem's musicality and emphasizes the contrast between the "grand" and the "common" things the speaker discusses.

The meter of the poem is predominantly iambic, with lines like "The nightingale is sweet of song" and "The poor man in his dwelling narrow" following a pattern of unstressed syllable followed by a stressed syllable. This rhythmic pattern helps to create a flowing and melodic quality to the poem.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of "Common Things" revolves around the contrast between lofty, grandiose subjects and the beauty found in everyday, ordinary things. The speaker expresses an appreciation for opulence and high culture, as indicated by references to wealth, El Dorado, silks, and knightly men. However, the speaker also values simplicity and the beauty of nature, exemplified by mentions of the poor man's dwelling, hollyhocks, bumblebees, meadow larks, and sparrows.

The imagery in the poem is vivid and evocative, painting a picture of both the glamorous and the humble aspects of life. The descriptions of silks and satins, exotic scents, and heroic men evoke a sense of grandeur, while references to the hollyhock, bumblebee, and chirping sparrow bring to mind scenes of everyday life and nature. This contrast in imagery highlights the speaker's belief in the importance of appreciating the common, ordinary things that surround us.

### Literary Devices

Dunbar employs several literary devices in "Common Things" to enhance the poem's meaning and impact. One notable device is contrast, which is evident throughout the poem as the speaker juxtaposes grandeur with simplicity, wealth with poverty, and high culture with nature. This contrast serves to underscore the speaker's message about the value of common things.

Another literary device used in the poem is imagery, particularly visual and sensory imagery. The descriptions of silks and satins sweeping through a story, exotic scents, and the sights and sounds of nature create a vivid and immersive experience for the reader, allowing them to visualize and feel the richness of the speaker's world.

### Historical and Personal Context

Paul Laurence Dunbar, an African American poet who wrote during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, often explored themes of race, identity, and social class in his work. In "Common Things," Dunbar may be commenting on the societal emphasis on wealth, status, and material possessions, as well as the importance of appreciating the beauty and value in everyday life, regardless of one's social standing.

Given Dunbar's own experiences with racial discrimination and the challenges he faced as a black writer in a predominantly white literary world, the poem's celebration of common things can also be seen as a reflection of his own appreciation for the simple joys and beauties that may have provided solace and inspiration in the face of adversity.

### Deep Reading

At its core, "Common Things" is a meditation on the nature of beauty and value. The speaker acknowledges the allure of wealth, luxury, and high culture, yet ultimately finds greater admiration for those who celebrate and find inspiration in the ordinary and commonplace. By elevating the man who sings of common things, the poem suggests that there is a profound beauty and significance in the everyday experiences that are often overlooked or undervalued.

Through this contrast between the grand and the common, Dunbar invites readers to consider what truly matters in life and to recognize the intrinsic worth of the simple, unassuming aspects of existence. In doing so, the poem challenges conventional notions of success and importance, urging us to find meaning and fulfillment in the common things that surround us each day.
