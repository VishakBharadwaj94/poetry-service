## Time's Revenges by Robert Browning

```
I've a Friend, over the sea;
I like him, but he loves me.
It all grew out of the books I write;
They find such favour in his sight
That he slaughters you with savage looks
Because you don't admire my books.
He does himself though,--and if some vein
Were to snap tonight in this heavy brain,
To-morrow month, if I lived to try,
Round should I just turn quietly,
Or out of the bedclothes stretch my hand
Till I found him, come from his foreign land
To be my nurse in this poor place,
And make my broth and wash my face
And light my fire and, all the while,
Bear with his old good-humoured smile
That I told him "Better have kept away
Than come and kill me, night and day,
With, worse than fever throbs and shoots,
The creaking of his clumsy boots."
I am as sure that this he would do,
As that Saint Paul's is striking two.
And I think I rather... woe is me!
--Yes, rather would see him than not see,
If lifting a hand could seat him there
Before me in the empty chair
To-night, when my head aches indeed,
And I can neither think nor read
Nor make these purple fingers hold
The pen; this garret's freezing cold!

And I've a Lady--there he wakes,
The laughing fiend and prince of snakes
Within me, at her name, to pray
Fate send some creature in the way
Of my love for her, to be down-torn,
Upthrust and outward-borne,
So I might prove myself that sea
Of passion which I needs must be!
Call my thoughts false and my fancies quaint
And my style infirm and its figures faint,
All the critics say, and more blame yet,
And not one angry word you get.
But, please you, wonder I would put
My cheek beneath that lady's foot
Rather than trample under mine
That laurels of the Florentine,
And you shall see how the devil spends
A fire God gave for other ends!
I tell you, I stride up and down
This garret, crowned with love's best crown,
And feasted with love's perfect feast,
To think I kill for her, at least,
Body and soul and peace and fame,
Alike youth's end and manhood's aim,
--So is my spirit, as flesh with sin,
Filled full, eaten out and in
With the face of her, the eyes of her,
The lips, the little chin, the stir
Of shadow round her mouth; and she
--I'll tell you,--calmly would decree
That I should roast at a slow fire,

If that would compass her desire
And make her one whom they invite
To the famous ball to-morrow night.

There may be heaven; there must be hell;
Meantime, there is our earth here--well!
```

## Common Things by Paul Laurence Dunbar

```
I like to hear of wealth and gold,
And El Doradoes in their glory;
I like for silks and satins bold
To sweep and rustle through a story.

The nightingale is sweet of song;
The rare exotic smells divinely;
And knightly men who stride along,
The role heroic carry finely.

But then, upon the other hand,
Our minds have got a way of running
To things that aren't quite so grand,
Which, maybe, we are best in shunning.

For some of us still like to see
The poor man in his dwelling narrow,
The hollyhock, the bumblebee,
The meadow lark, and chirping sparrow.

We like the man who soars and sings
With high and lofty inspiration;
But he who sings of common things
Shall always share our admiration.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "Common Things" by Paul Laurence Dunbar is structured as a classic rhymed quatrain poem, with each stanza consisting of four lines. The rhyme scheme is AABB, where the first and second lines rhyme with each other, as do the third and fourth lines. This consistent rhyme scheme helps create a sense of musicality and cohesion throughout the poem. 

In terms of meter, the poem follows a regular pattern of iambic tetrameter, with each line containing four stressed and unstressed syllables. This meter gives the poem a steady and rhythmic flow, enhancing its readability and making it easier for the reader to engage with the content.

### Themes and Imagery

The overarching theme of the poem is the contrast between the allure of grandeur and the beauty found in simplicity. The speaker expresses a preference for common, everyday things over extravagant and ostentatious displays of wealth or heroism. Through vivid imagery, the poem paints a picture of the beauty in nature and the ordinary, such as the hollyhock, bumblebee, meadow lark, and chirping sparrow. These images evoke a sense of nostalgia and appreciation for the small, often overlooked aspects of life.

### Literary Devices

Dunbar employs various literary devices to enhance the meaning and impact of the poem. One such device is imagery, as seen in lines such as "The hollyhock, the bumblebee, / The meadow lark, and chirping sparrow." These images evoke a sense of simplicity and beauty in nature, contrasting with the extravagant silks and satins mentioned earlier in the poem.

Another literary device used is contrast, as the speaker juxtaposes the grandeur of wealth and glory with the humble beauty of common things. This contrast serves to emphasize the speaker's preference for the latter and highlights the idea that true inspiration can be found in the everyday.

### Historical and Personal Context

Paul Laurence Dunbar, an African American poet writing in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, often explored themes of race, identity, and social inequality in his works. While "Common Things" does not explicitly address these themes, Dunbar's personal experiences as a black man in a society marked by racial discrimination likely influenced his perspective on the value of simplicity and authenticity in life.

Furthermore, the poem reflects a broader cultural shift towards romanticizing nature and the rural lifestyle during the late 19th century. This sentiment was a reaction against the rapid industrialization and urbanization of the time, with many artists and writers advocating for a return to nature and a simpler way of living.

### Deep Reading

On a deeper level, "Common Things" can be seen as a meditation on the nature of art and inspiration. The speaker acknowledges the appeal of grandiose tales and heroic figures but ultimately asserts that those who celebrate and elevate the ordinary and mundane are equally deserving of admiration. This can be interpreted as a commentary on the power of everyday experiences and the potential for beauty and meaning in the seemingly insignificant aspects of life.

Additionally, the poem can be read as a call to appreciate the beauty and richness of the world around us, even in the most ordinary of things. By highlighting the value of common things like the hollyhock and chirping sparrow, the speaker encourages the reader to look beyond material wealth and societal status in search of true inspiration and fulfillment. Ultimately, "Common Things" celebrates the beauty of simplicity and the profound impact of the everyday on our lives.

## Winter: My Secret by Christina Rossetti

```
I tell my secret? No indeed, not I:
Perhaps some day, who knows?
But not today; it froze, and blows, and snows,
And you're too curious: fie!
You want to hear it? well:
Only, my secret's mine, and I won't tell.

Or, after all, perhaps there's none:
Suppose there is no secret after all,
But only just my fun.
Today's a nipping day, a biting day;
In which one wants a shawl,
A veil, a cloak, and other wraps:
I cannot ope to every one who taps,
And let the draughts come whistling thro' my hall;
Come bounding and surrounding me,
Come buffeting, astounding me,
Nipping and clipping thro' my wraps and all.
I wear my mask for warmth: who ever shows
His nose to Russian snows
To be pecked at by every wind that blows?
You would not peck? I thank you for good will,
Believe, but leave that truth untested still.

Spring's and expansive time: yet I don't trust
March with its peck of dust,
Nor April with its rainbow-crowned brief showers,
Nor even May, whose flowers
One frost may wither thro' the sunless hours.
Perhaps some languid summer day,
When drowsy birds sing less and less,
And golden fruit is ripening to excess,
If there's not too much sun nor too much cloud,
And the warm wind is neither still nor loud,
Perhaps my secret I may say,
Or you may guess.
```

### Literary Devices

Rossetti employs several literary devices in the poem to enhance its meaning. The repetition of the phrase "my secret" emphasizes the speaker's possessiveness over their thoughts and emotions. The use of personification, such as the wind "whistling thro' my hall" and "bounding and surrounding me," adds depth to the imagery and creates a sense of intrusion and discomfort.

The speaker's rhetorical questions, such as "Who ever shows / His nose to Russian snows," challenge the reader to consider the consequences of revealing one's vulnerabilities.
