## From “Later Life” by Christina Rossetti

```
VI
We lack, yet cannot fix upon the lack:
Not this, nor that; yet somewhat, certainly.
We see the things we do not yearn to see
Around us: and what see we glancing back?
Lost hopes that leave our hearts upon the rack,
Hopes that were never ours yet seem’d to be,
For which we steer’d on life’s salt stormy sea
Braving the sunstroke and the frozen pack.
If thus to look behind is all in vain,
And all in vain to look to left or right,
Why face we not our future once again,
Launching with hardier hearts across the main,
Straining dim eyes to catch the invisible sight,
And strong to bear ourselves in patient pain?

IX
Star Sirius and the Pole Star dwell afar
Beyond the drawings each of other’s strength:
One blazes through the brief bright summer’s length
Lavishing life-heat from a flaming car;
While one unchangeable upon a throne
Broods o’er the frozen heart of earth alone,
Content to reign the bright particular star
Of some who wander or of some who groan.
They own no drawings each of other’s strength,
Nor vibrate in a visible sympathy,
Nor veer along their courses each toward
Yet are their orbits pitch’d in harmony
Of one dear heaven, across whose depth and length
Mayhap they talk together without speech.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

In "Later Life," Christina Rossetti utilizes a traditional form with consistent rhyme and meter. The poem consists of two verses, VI and IX, each with a distinct focus. The rhyme scheme is ABAB CDCD in verse VI and ABAB CDCD EE in verse IX. The meter is predominantly iambic pentameter, with five metrical feet per line.

### Themes and Imagery

The themes in "Later Life" revolve around reflection, loss, hope, and resilience. In verse VI, the speaker grapples with a sense of lack and lost hopes, reflecting on past decisions and the challenges faced in life. The imagery of "life’s salt stormy sea" and "braving the sunstroke and the frozen pack" conveys the hardships and uncertainties of existence. In contrast, verse IX explores the idea of distance and connection between celestial bodies, symbolizing relationships and the concept of harmony despite physical separation.

### Literary Devices

Rossetti employs various literary devices to enhance the themes and imagery in the poem. In verse VI, there is a use of paradox in the lines "We lack, yet cannot fix upon the lack" and "Lost hopes that leave our hearts upon the rack," highlighting the speaker's internal turmoil. Additionally, the repetition of "vain" in "If thus to look behind is all in vain" creates a sense of futility. In verse IX, the personification of stars like Sirius and the Pole Star adds depth to the comparison between their distant yet harmonious orbits.

### Historical and Personal Context

Christina Rossetti, a Victorian poet known for her introspective and often melancholic themes, wrote "Later Life" during a period of personal reflection and contemplation. This introspective tone is reflective of the Victorian era's focus on individual emotions and experiences. The themes of loss and resilience may also resonate with Rossetti's own struggles and beliefs, as she often explored themes of faith, love, and mortality in her works.

### Deep Reading

At its core, "Later Life" delves into the complexities of human experience and the enduring quest for meaning and purpose. The speaker's contemplation of past regrets and lost hopes in verse VI reflects a universal struggle with the passage of time and the inevitability of change. The celestial imagery in verse IX serves as a metaphor for connection and harmony in relationships, despite physical distance. Ultimately, the poem encourages readers to confront the uncertainties of the future with resilience and patience, embracing the unknown with courage and determination.

## Abt Vogler: After he has been extemporizing upon the musical instrument of his invention by Robert Browning

```
Would that the structure brave, the manifold music I build,
  Bidding my organ obey, calling its keys to their work,
Claiming each slave of the sound, at a touch, as when Solomon willed
  Armies of angels that soar, legions of demons that lurk,
Man, brute, reptile, fly,--alien of end and of aim,
  Adverse, each from the other heaven-high, hell-deep removed,--
Should rush into sight at once as he named the ineffable Name,
  And pile him a palace straight, to pleasure the princess he loved!

Would it might tarry like his, the beautiful building of mine,
  This which my keys in a crowd pressed and importuned to raise!
Ah, one and all, how they helped, would dispart now and now combine,
  Zealous to hasten the work, heighten their master his praise!
And one would bury his brow with a blind plunge down to hell,
  Burrow awhile and build, broad on the roots of things,
Then up again swim into sight, having based me my palace well,
  Founded it, fearless of flame, flat on the nether springs.

And another would mount and march, like the excellent minion he was,
  Ay, another and yet another, one crowd but with many a crest,
Raising my rampired walls of gold as transparent as glass,
  Eager to do and die, yield each his place to the rest:
For higher still and higher (as a runner tips with fire,
  When a great illumination surprises a festal night--
Outlining round and round Rome's dome from space to spire)
  Up, the pinnacled glory reached, and the pride of my soul was in sight.

In sight? Not half! for it seemed, it was certain, to match man's birth,
  Nature in turn conceived, obeying an impulse as I;
And the emulous heaven yearned down, made effort to reach the earth.
  As the earth had done her best, in my passion, to scale the sky:
Novel splendours burst forth, grew familiar and dwelt with mine.
  Not a point nor peak but found and fixed its wandering star;
Meteor-moons, balls of blaze: and they did not pale nor pine,
  For earth had attained to heaven, there was no more near nor far.

Nay more; for there wanted not who walked, in the glare and glow,
  Presences plain in the place; or, fresh, from the Protoplast,
Furnished for ages to come, when a kindlier wind should blow,
  Lured now to begin and live, in a house to their liking at last:
Or else the wonderful Dead who have passed thro' the body and gone,
  But were back once more to breathe in an old world worth their new:
What never had been, was now; what was, as it shall be anon;
  And what is,--shall I say, matched both? for I was made perfect too.

All thro' my keys that gave their sounds to a wish of my soul,
  All thro' my soul that praised as its wish flowed visibly forth,
All thro' music and me! For think, had I painted the whole,
  Why, there it had stood, to see, nor the process so wonder-worth:
Had I written the same, made verse--still, effect proceeds from cause,
  Ye know why the forms are fair, ye hear how the tale is told;
It is all triumphant art, but art in obedience to laws,
  Painter and poet are proud, in the artist-list enrolled:--

But here is the finger of God, a flash of the will that can,
  Existent behind all laws, that made them, and, lo, they are!
And I know not if, save in this, such gift be allowed to man,
  That out of three sounds he frame, not a fourth sound, but a star.
Consider it well: each tone of our scale in itself is naught;
  It is everywhere in the world--loud, soft, and all is said:
Give it to me to use! I mix it with two in my thought,
  And, there! Ye have heard and seen; consider and bow the head!

Well, it is gone at last, the palace of music I reared;
  Gone! and the good tears start, the praises that come too slow;
For one is assured at first, one scarce can say that he feared,
  That he even gave it a thought, the gone thing was to go.
Never to be again! But many more of the kind
  As good, nay, better perchance: is this your comfort to me?
To me, who must be saved because I cling with my mind
  To the same, same self, same love, same God: ay, what was, shall be.

Therefore to whom turn I but to Thee, the ineffable Name?
  Builder and maker, Thou, of houses not made with hands!
What, have fear of change from Thee who art ever the same?
  Doubt that Thy power can fill the heart that Thy power expands?
There shall never be one lost good! What was, shall live as before;
  The evil is null, is naught, is silence implying sound;
What was good, shall be good, with, for evil, so much good more;
  On the earth the broken arcs; in the heaven, a perfect round.

All we have willed or hoped or dreamed of good shall exist;
  Not its semblance, but itself; no beauty, nor good, nor power
Whose voice has gone forth, but each survives for the melodist,
  When eternity affirms the conception of an hour.
The high that proved too high, the heroic for earth too hard.
  The passion that left the ground to lose itself in the sky,
Are music sent up to God by the lover and the bard;
  Enough that he heard it once; we shall hear it by and by.

And what is our failure here but a triumph's evidence
  For the fulness of the days? Have we withered or agonized?
Why else was the pause prolonged but that singing might issue thence?
  Why rushed the discords in but that harmony should be prized?
Sorrow is hard to bear, and doubt is slow to clear,
  Each sufferer says his say, his scheme of the weal and woe:
But God has a few of us whom He whispers in the ear;
  The rest may reason and welcome; 'tis we musicians know.

Well, it is earth with me; silence resumes her reign:
  I will be patient and proud, and soberly acquiesce.
Give me the keys. I feel for the common chord again,
  Sliding by semitones, till I sink to the minor,--yes,
And I blunt it into a ninth, and I stand on alien ground,
  Surveying awhile the heights I rolled from into the deep:
Which, hark, I have dared and done, for my resting-place is found,
  The C Major of this life: so, now I will try to sleep.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "Abt Vogler" by Robert Browning is written in blank verse, which consists of unrhymed iambic pentameter lines. Browning uses a consistent structure throughout the poem, with each stanza consisting of six lines. The meter is iambic pentameter, which means each line has five pairs of syllables with the stress on every second syllable. The lack of rhyme scheme allows the focus to remain on the content and themes of the poem rather than the formalities of rhyme.

### Themes and Imagery

The poem explores themes of creativity, artistry, and the power of music. The imagery in the poem is vivid and evocative, with references to biblical figures like Solomon, angels, and demons. Browning uses imagery of building a palace, raising rampired walls of gold, and scaling the heights to convey the idea of creating something beautiful and transcendent through music. The imagery of music as a divine gift and a means of reaching higher spiritual realms is prevalent throughout the poem.

### Literary Devices

Browning employs various literary devices in the poem, including alliteration, metaphor, and personification. Alliteration can be seen in phrases like "bidding my organ obey" and "found and fixed its wandering star," adding a musical quality to the text. Metaphors are used to compare the act of creating music to building a palace or scaling the heights. Personification is evident in lines like "each slave of the sound" and "the finger of God," giving human-like qualities to abstract concepts.

### Historical and Personal Context

Robert Browning was a Victorian poet known for his dramatic monologues and exploration of human psychology. "Abt Vogler" was written in the mid-19th century, a time of great artistic and intellectual growth in Europe. The poem reflects Browning's own fascination with music and the creative process. The character of Abt Vogler is based on the real-life composer and organist, Georg Joseph Vogler, known for his improvisational skills and innovations in music.

### Deep Reading

The poem delves deep into the nature of artistic creation and the artist's relationship with their work. Browning uses Abt Vogler as a mouthpiece to express his own views on the power of music to transcend earthly limitations and connect with the divine. The poem celebrates the act of creation and the ability of art to capture fleeting moments of beauty and emotion. It also grapples with the idea of impermanence and the fleeting nature of artistic achievements, suggesting that true artistry lies in the process rather than the end result. Ultimately, "Abt Vogler" is a meditation on the enduring power of music and the artist's quest for perfection and transcendence.

## Disabled by Wilfred Owen

```
He sat in a wheeled chair, waiting for dark,
And shivered in his ghastly suit of grey,
Legless, sewn short at elbow.  Through the park
Voices of boys rang saddening like a hymn,
Voices of play and pleasure after day,
Till gathering sleep had mothered them from him.

About this time Town used to swing so gay
When glow-lamps budded in the light-blue trees
And girls glanced lovelier as the air grew dim,
-- In the old times, before he threw away his knees.
Now he will never feel again how slim
Girls' waists are, or how warm their subtle hands,
All of them touch him like some queer disease.

There was an artist silly for his face,
For it was younger than his youth, last year.
Now he is old; his back will never brace;
He's lost his colour very far from here,
Poured it down shell-holes till the veins ran dry,
And half his lifetime lapsed in the hot race,
And leap of purple spurted from his thigh.
One time he liked a bloodsmear down his leg,
After the matches carried shoulder-high.
It was after football, when he'd drunk a peg,
He thought he'd better join.  He wonders why . . .
Someone had said he'd look a god in kilts.

That's why; and maybe, too, to please his Meg,
Aye, that was it, to please the giddy jilts,
He asked to join.  He didn't have to beg;
Smiling they wrote his lie; aged nineteen years.
Germans he scarcely thought of; and no fears
Of Fear came yet.  He thought of jewelled hilts
For daggers in plaid socks; of smart salutes;
And care of arms; and leave; and pay arrears;
Esprit de corps; and hints for young recruits.
And soon, he was drafted out with drums and cheers.

Some cheered him home, but not as crowds cheer Goal.
Only a solemn man who brought him fruits
Thanked him; and then inquired about his soul.
Now, he will spend a few sick years in Institutes,
And do what things the rules consider wise,
And take whatever pity they may dole.
To-night he noticed how the women's eyes
Passed from him to the strong men that were whole.
How cold and late it is!  Why don't they come
And put him into bed?  Why don't they come?
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "Disabled" by Wilfred Owen consists of seven stanzas with varying line lengths, ranging from five to thirteen lines per stanza. The irregular structure mirrors the disjointed and fragmented thoughts of the disabled soldier, conveying a sense of disorientation and confusion. The lack of a consistent rhyme scheme adds to the overall feeling of unease and sadness in the poem. The enjambment in the lines also contributes to the flow of the poem, connecting thoughts and emotions seamlessly.

### Themes and Imagery

One of the central themes in the poem is the devastating impact of war on an individual's physical and mental well-being. Through vivid imagery, Owen paints a stark picture of the soldier's life post-war, highlighting his physical disabilities, loss of youth, and alienation from society. The contrast between the soldier's past and present, particularly in the descriptions of vibrant scenes from his youth juxtaposed with his current state of isolation and despair, underscores the theme of loss and disillusionment.

The imagery in the poem is vivid and poignant, evoking a sense of pathos and sympathy for the disabled soldier. The descriptions of his physical injuries, such as being "legless, sewn short at elbow" and having "lost his colour very far from here," emphasize the soldier's profound suffering and loss of identity. The references to the soldier's memories of youth, beauty, and vitality serve to highlight the stark contrast between his past and present realities.

### Literary Devices

Owen employs various literary devices to convey the emotional depth of the soldier's experience. The use of simile in "All of them touch him like some queer disease" not only emphasizes the soldier's sense of alienation but also highlights the dehumanizing effect of his disability. The repetition of the word "voices" in the first stanza creates a haunting effect, echoing the soldier's longing for connection and belonging.

The poem also utilizes irony, particularly in the soldier's decision to enlist in the army out of vanity and to impress a woman. The juxtaposition of his youthful naivety and the harsh realities of war serves as a powerful commentary on the disillusionment and loss of innocence experienced by many soldiers during wartime.

### Historical and Personal Context

As a soldier who fought in World War I, Wilfred Owen brings a profound understanding of the physical and psychological toll of war to his poetry. "Disabled" reflects the harsh realities faced by soldiers who returned from the war with life-altering injuries, grappling with physical disabilities and emotional trauma. Owen's own experiences in the war likely informed his portrayal of the soldier's suffering and disillusionment in the poem.

The poem also captures the societal attitudes towards disabled veterans during Owen's time, highlighting the lack of empathy and support for those who had sacrificed their health and well-being in service to their country. The soldier's isolation and alienation from society reflect the challenges faced by many disabled veterans in reintegrating into civilian life after the war.

### Deep Reading

"Disabled" is a poignant and powerful exploration of the devastating impact of war on an individual's life. Through vivid imagery, evocative language, and emotional depth, Wilfred Owen conveys the physical and psychological anguish experienced by a disabled soldier, highlighting themes of loss, disillusionment, and alienation. The poem serves as a searing indictment of the human cost of war and the profound sacrifices made by those who serve in the military. By delving into the soldier's inner turmoil and shattered dreams, Owen invites readers to confront the harsh realities of conflict and the lasting scars it leaves on both the body and the soul.
