## Spirits Of The Dead by Edgar Allan Poe

```
Thy soul shall find itself alone
'Mid dark thoughts of the gray tombstone
Not one, of all the crowd, to pry
Into thine hour of secrecy.
Be silent in that solitude
  Which is not loneliness--for then
The spirits of the dead who stood
  In life before thee are again
In death around thee--and their will
Shall overshadow thee: be still.
The night--tho' clear--shall frown--
And the stars shall not look down
From their high thrones in the Heaven,
With light like Hope to mortals given--
But their red orbs, without beam,
To thy weariness shall seem
As a burning and a fever
Which would cling to thee forever.
Now are thoughts thou shalt not banish--
Now are visions ne'er to vanish--
From thy spirit shall they pass
No more--like dew-drops from the grass.
The breeze--the breath of God--is still--
And the mist upon the hill
Shadowy--shadowy--yet unbroken,
  Is a symbol and a token--
  How it hangs upon the trees,
  A mystery of mysteries!
```

## A Dream by Edward Thomas

```
OVER known fields with an old friend in dream
I walked, but came sudden to a strange stream.
Its dark waters were bursting out most bright
From a great mountain's heart into the light.
They ran a short course under the sun, then back
Into a pit they plunged, once more as black
As at their birth; and I stood thinking there
How white, had the day shone on them, they were,
Heaving and coiling. So by the roar and hiss
And by the mighty motion of the abyss
I was bemused, that I forgot my friend
And neither saw nor sought him till the end,
When I awoke from waters unto men
Saying: "I shall be here some day again."
```

### Analysis

In Edward Thomas' poem "A Dream," the speaker recounts a vivid dream where they walk with an old friend and come across a mysterious stream. The poem is structured in a free verse form, with irregular line lengths and no rhyme scheme. This lack of traditional structure mirrors the unpredictable nature of dreams and adds to the dream-like quality of the poem.

The key themes in the poem revolve around the contrast between light and darkness, the fleeting nature of beauty, and the overwhelming power of nature. The imagery of the dark waters bursting out brightly from the mountain's heart symbolizes the sudden moments of clarity and beauty that can be found in unexpected places. The imagery of the waters running under the sun and then plunging back into darkness reflects the transient nature of beauty and how quickly it can be obscured.

Literary devices such as personification, metaphor, and imagery are used throughout the poem to create a sense of wonder and awe. The stream is personified as bursting out most bright and heaving and coiling, giving it a sense of life and movement. The metaphor of the stream as a reflection of beauty that is fleeting and easily obscured adds depth to the poem.

In terms of historical and personal context, Edward Thomas was a British poet who often explored themes of nature, beauty, and the passage of time in his work. This poem can be seen as a reflection of Thomas' own struggles with finding moments of clarity and beauty in a world that is often dark and chaotic.

A deep reading of the poem reveals a sense of longing and nostalgia for moments of beauty and connection that are fleeting and easily forgotten. The speaker's preoccupation with the mesmerizing power of the stream causes them to forget their friend until the end, suggesting a sense of isolation and introspection. The final lines of the poem, "Saying: 'I shall be here some day again,'" hint at a desire to return to this moment of beauty and connection, even if it is only in dreams.

Overall, "A Dream" is a reflective and introspective poem that explores themes of beauty, transience, and the overwhelming power of nature. Through vivid imagery and thoughtful reflection, Edward Thomas invites readers to contemplate the fleeting moments of beauty that can be found in unexpected places.

## Pine-Trees and the Sky: Evening by Rupert Brooke

```
I'd watched the sorrow of the evening sky,
And smelt the sea, and earth, and the warm clover,
And heard the waves, and the seagull's mocking cry.

And in them all was only the old cry,
That song they always sing -- "The best is over!
You may remember now, and think, and sigh,
O silly lover!"
And I was tired and sick that all was over,
And because I,
For all my thinking, never could recover
One moment of the good hours that were over.
And I was sorry and sick, and wished to die.

Then from the sad west turning wearily,
I saw the pines against the white north sky,
Very beautiful, and still, and bending over
Their sharp black heads against a quiet sky.
And there was peace in them; and I
Was happy, and forgot to play the lover,
And laughed, and did no longer wish to die;
Being glad of you, O pine-trees and the sky!
```
