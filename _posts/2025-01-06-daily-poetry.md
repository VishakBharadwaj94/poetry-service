## Sonnet 38 - First time he kissed me, he but only kissed by Elizabeth Barrett Browning

```
First time he kissed me, he but only kissed
The fingers of this hand wherewith I write;
And ever since, it grew more clean and white,
Slow to world-greetings, quick with its 'Oh, list,'
When the angels speak. A ring of amethyst
I could not wear here, plainer to my sight,
Than that first kiss. The second passed in height
The first, and sought the forehead, and half missed,
Half falling on the hair. O beyond meed!
That was the chrism of love, which love's own crown,
With sanctifying sweetness, did precede.
The third upon my lips was folded down
In perfect, purple state; since when, indeed,
I have been proud and said, 'My love, my own.'
```

## From “Later Life” by Christina Rossetti

```
VI
We lack, yet cannot fix upon the lack:
Not this, nor that; yet somewhat, certainly.
We see the things we do not yearn to see
Around us: and what see we glancing back?
Lost hopes that leave our hearts upon the rack,
Hopes that were never ours yet seem’d to be,
For which we steer’d on life’s salt stormy sea
Braving the sunstroke and the frozen pack.
If thus to look behind is all in vain,
And all in vain to look to left or right,
Why face we not our future once again,
Launching with hardier hearts across the main,
Straining dim eyes to catch the invisible sight,
And strong to bear ourselves in patient pain?

IX
Star Sirius and the Pole Star dwell afar
Beyond the drawings each of other’s strength:
One blazes through the brief bright summer’s length
Lavishing life-heat from a flaming car;
While one unchangeable upon a throne
Broods o’er the frozen heart of earth alone,
Content to reign the bright particular star
Of some who wander or of some who groan.
They own no drawings each of other’s strength,
Nor vibrate in a visible sympathy,
Nor veer along their courses each toward
Yet are their orbits pitch’d in harmony
Of one dear heaven, across whose depth and length
Mayhap they talk together without speech.
```

### Analysis

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

In terms of form, these two stanzas from Christina Rossetti's poem "From Later Life" consist of two sonnets. Sonnets traditionally have fourteen lines, and in this case, each stanza has eight lines (octave) followed by six lines (sestet). The rhyme scheme in the first stanza (VI) is ABBAABBA CDCDCD, while the rhyme scheme in the second stanza (IX) is ABBAAB ABABCC. This adherence to the traditional sonnet form adds a sense of structure and control to the poem.

The meter in these stanzas is predominantly iambic pentameter, which means each line has five metrical feet with each foot consisting of an unstressed syllable followed by a stressed syllable. This regular meter contributes to the poem's musicality and flow.

### Themes and Imagery

The themes of longing, loss, and perseverance are prevalent in these stanzas. In stanza VI, the speaker reflects on lost hopes and a sense of aimlessness in looking back at the past. The imagery of "life’s salt stormy sea" and "braving the sunstroke and the frozen pack" conveys the struggles and challenges faced in life.

In stanza IX, the speaker compares the distant stars Sirius and the Pole Star to illustrate the idea of distance and lack of connection. The imagery of Sirius "lavishing life-heat from a flaming car" contrasts with the Pole Star "brooding o’er the frozen heart of earth alone," highlighting different approaches to existence and rulership.

### Literary Devices

Rossetti employs various literary devices in these stanzas to enhance meaning and evoke emotions. In stanza VI, the use of paradox in "We lack, yet cannot fix upon the lack" conveys a sense of ambiguity and uncertainty. The repetition of "all in vain" emphasizes the futility of looking back or sideways, urging the speaker to focus on the future.

In stanza IX, the personification of the stars as having conversations without speech suggests a deeper connection beyond physical proximity. The imagery of stars "veering along their courses" hints at the idea of fate or predetermined paths in life.

### Historical and Personal Context

Christina Rossetti was a prominent Victorian poet known for her introspective and often melancholic poetry. Her works often explore themes of love, loss, and spirituality, reflecting the societal constraints and personal struggles of her time. In "From Later Life," Rossetti contemplates the passage of time, missed opportunities, and the search for meaning in a world filled with uncertainty.

### Deep Reading

These stanzas delve into the complexities of human experience, particularly the conflicting emotions of nostalgia, regret, and hope. The speaker grapples with the idea of lost opportunities and unfulfilled desires, yet also urges resilience and forward-looking perseverance. The comparison of the distant stars serves as a metaphor for the isolation and distance that can exist between individuals, while also hinting at a cosmic interconnectedness that transcends physical boundaries.

Overall, Rossetti's poem invites readers to reflect on the cyclical nature of life, the inevitability of change, and the importance of facing the future with courage and resilience. Through vivid imagery, intricate rhyme schemes, and profound themes, "From Later Life" captures the universal human experience of navigating the complexities of existence.
