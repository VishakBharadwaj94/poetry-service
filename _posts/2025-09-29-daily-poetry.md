## Spring Offensive by Wilfred Owen

```
Halted against the shade of a last hill,
They fed, and, lying easy, were at ease
And, finding comfortable chests and knees
Carelessly slept.  But many there stood still
To face the stark, blank sky beyond the ridge,
Knowing their feet had come to the end of the world.

Marvelling they stood, and watched the long grass swirled
By the May breeze, murmurous with wasp and midge,
For though the summer oozed into their veins
Like the injected drug for their bones' pains,
Sharp on their souls hung the imminent line of grass,
Fearfully flashed the sky's mysterious glass.

Hour after hour they ponder the warm field --
And the far valley behind, where the buttercups
Had blessed with gold their slow boots coming up,
Where even the little brambles would not yield,
But clutched and clung to them like sorrowing hands;
They breathe like trees unstirred.

Till like a cold gust thrilled the little word
At which each body and its soul begird
And tighten them for battle.  No alarms
Of bugles, no high flags, no clamorous haste --
Only a lift and flare of eyes that faced
The sun, like a friend with whom their love is done.
O larger shone that smile against the sun, --
Mightier than his whose bounty these have spurned.

So, soon they topped the hill, and raced together
Over an open stretch of herb and heather
Exposed.  And instantly the whole sky burned
With fury against them; and soft sudden cups
Opened in thousands for their blood; and the green slopes
Chasmed and steepened sheer to infinite space.

Of them who running on that last high place
Leapt to swift unseen bullets, or went up
On the hot blast and fury of hell's upsurge,
Or plunged and fell away past this world's verge,
Some say God caught them even before they fell.

But what say such as from existence' brink
Ventured but drave too swift to sink.
The few who rushed in the body to enter hell,
And there out-fiending all its fiends and flames
With superhuman inhumanities,
Long-famous glories, immemorial shames --
And crawling slowly back, have by degrees
Regained cool peaceful air in wonder --
Why speak they not of comrades that went under?
```

## At Home by Christina Rossetti

```
When I was dead, my spirit turned
To seek the much-frequented house:
I passed the door, and saw my friends
Feasting beneath green orange boughs;
From hand to hand they pushed the wine,
They sucked the pulp of plum and peach;
They sang, they jested, and they laughed,
For each was loved of each.

I listened to thier honest chat:
Said one: "To-morrow we shall be
Plod plod along the featureless sands,
And coasting miles and miles of sea."
Said one: "Before the turn of tide
We will achieve the eyrie-seat."
Said one: "To-morrow shall be like
To-day, but much more sweet."

"To-morrow," said they, strong with hope,
And dwelt upon the pleasant way:
"To-morrow," cried they, one and all,
While no one spoke of yesterday.
Their life stood full at blessed noon;
I, only I, had passed away:
"To-morrow and to-day," they cried;
I was of yesterday.

I shivered comfortless, but cast
No chill across the table-cloth;
I, all-forgotten, shivered, sad
To stay, and yet to part how loth:
I passed from the familiar room,
I who from love had passed away,
Like the remembrance of a guest
That tarrieth but a day.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

In terms of form, "At Home" by Christina Rossetti is a narrative poem consisting of three stanzas with varying line lengths. The poem does not adhere to a strict meter or rhyme scheme, giving it a more conversational and introspective tone. This lack of regular rhyme and meter reflects the speaker's disjointed and detached emotional state as they observe their friends from beyond the grave. The irregular structure mirrors the speaker's sense of being out of place in the familiar setting of their friends' gathering.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem is the passage of time and the inevitability of death. The speaker, who has passed away, observes their friends enjoying a feast and planning for the future without them. The imagery of the friends feasting beneath green orange boughs evokes a sense of abundance and vitality, highlighting the stark contrast between their joyous celebration of life and the speaker's cold, lonely existence as a spirit. The repeated references to "To-morrow" emphasize the friends' focus on the future and their reluctance to dwell on the past, underscoring the fleeting nature of human life.

### Literary Devices

Rossetti employs several literary devices to convey the speaker's sense of isolation and longing. The use of personification in lines such as "I shivered comfortless" and "I, all-forgotten, shivered, sad" imbues the speaker's emotions with a tangible presence, emphasizing their alienation from the living world. The repetition of "To-morrow" and the contrast between the friends' vibrant dialogue and the speaker's silent observation create a poignant juxtaposition that underscores the theme of mortality. Additionally, the simile "Like the remembrance of a guest/ That tarrieth but a day" conveys the speaker's fleeting presence in the lives of their friends.

### Historical and Personal Context

Christina Rossetti, a Victorian poet known for her introspective and melancholic themes, often explored mortality, love, and loss in her work. "At Home" reflects Rossetti's preoccupation with death and the transient nature of human relationships. The poem may also be influenced by Rossetti's own experiences of loss and longing, as she grappled with the deaths of loved ones and her own mortality throughout her life.

### Deep Reading

"At Home" delves into the complex emotions surrounding death and the passage of time, highlighting the bittersweet nature of memory and human connection. The speaker's poignant observation of their friends' joyful gathering underscores the eternal divide between the living and the dead, as well as the inevitability of being forgotten. The poem invites readers to contemplate the fragility of life and the enduring impact of our presence on others, even after we have passed away. Through its introspective tone and vivid imagery, "At Home" serves as a poignant meditation on the fleeting nature of human existence and the enduring power of memory.

## Thaw by Edward Thomas

```
OVER the land freckled with snow half-thawed
The speculating rooks at their nests cawed
And saw from elm-tops, delicate as flower of grass,
What we below could not see, Winter pass.
```

### Themes and Imagery

One of the central themes of the poem is the transition from winter to spring. Through vivid imagery, the poet describes the thawing landscape and the signs of approaching spring. The snow that is "half-thawed" suggests a gradual change in seasons, symbolizing the passage of time and renewal.

The delicate elm-tops, likened to the "flower of grass," symbolize the fragility and beauty of nature.

### Literary Devices

Personification is evident in the lines "What we below could not see, Winter pass," where Winter is personified as a passing entity. The use of simile in comparing the elm-tops to the "flower of grass" adds depth to the imagery, highlighting the delicate and ephemeral nature of the scene.

### Historical and Personal Context

Edward Thomas was a British poet who often explored themes of nature, war, and mortality in his works. As a contemporary of World War I, Thomas's poetry reflects the turbulent times he lived in.

### Deep Reading
