## Lines by Percy Bysshe Shelley

```
That time is dead for ever, child!
Drowned, frozen, dead for ever!
We look on the past
And stare aghast
At the spectres wailing, pale and ghast,
Of hopes which thou and I beguiled
To death on life's dark river.

The stream we gazed on then rolled by;
Its waves are unreturning;
But we yet stand
In a lone land,
Like tombs to mark the memory
Of hopes and fears, which fade and flee
In the light of life's dim morning.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

In "Lines" by Percy Bysshe Shelley, the poem consists of three stanzas with a consistent ABAB rhyme scheme. The poem is written in iambic tetrameter, with each line containing four stressed syllables. This consistent structure and rhyme scheme create a sense of fluidity and cohesion throughout the poem. The use of enjambment, where lines flow into each other without punctuation, adds to the sense of continuity and the passage of time. The structured form of the poem reflects the theme of time and the inevitable passing of moments.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem revolves around the passage of time and the ephemeral nature of life. The speaker addresses a child, emphasizing the finality of time's passing by declaring it "dead for ever." The imagery of death, freezing, and drowning conveys the idea of irretrievable loss and the inability to revisit the past. The spectres of hopes and dreams that have been lost serve as a haunting reminder of the transience of existence. The image of standing in a "lone land" like tombs symbolizes the isolation and melancholy that accompany the fading of hopes and fears.

### Literary Devices

Shelley employs various literary devices to enhance the poem's impact. The repetition of the word "dead" in the first two lines emphasizes the finality of time's passing and sets a somber tone. The use of alliteration in "spectres wailing, pale and ghast" creates a haunting image of lost dreams. The metaphor of life's journey as a "dark river" suggests the unknown and sometimes treacherous path that one must navigate. Additionally, the comparison of the speaker and the child to "tombs" serves as a powerful symbol of the weight of memory and the inevitability of change.

### Historical and Personal Context

Percy Bysshe Shelley, a Romantic poet, often explored themes of nature, beauty, and the transient nature of life in his works. "Lines" reflects Shelley's preoccupation with the passage of time and the impermanence of human existence. The poem was likely influenced by the personal losses and tragedies that Shelley experienced in his own life, such as the deaths of loved ones and political unrest during his time. These experiences likely informed his meditation on the fleeting nature of hopes and dreams.

### Deep Reading

At its core, "Lines" serves as a poignant reflection on the inevitability of change and the impermanence of human aspirations. The speaker's address to the child underscores the cyclical nature of life, where each generation must confront the passing of time and the ghosts of lost dreams. The poem encourages readers to contemplate the fleeting nature of existence and the importance of cherishing the present moment. Ultimately, Shelley's exploration of time and memory in "Lines" reminds us of the fragility of life and the enduring power of remembrance.

## Father Gerard Hopkins, S. J. by Joyce Kilmer

```
Why didst thou carve thy speech laboriously,
And match and blend thy words with curious art?
For Song, one saith, is but a human heart
Speaking aloud, undisciplined and free.
Nay, God be praised, Who fixed thy task for thee!
Austere, ecstatic craftsman, set apart
From all who traffic in Apollo's mart,
On thy phrased paten shall the Splendour be!
Now, carelessly we throw a rhyme to God,
Singing His praise when other songs are done.
But thou, who knewest paths Teresa trod,
Losing thyself, what is it thou hast won?
O bleeding feet, with peace and glory shod!
O happy moth, that flew into the Sun!
```

## Merry Autumn by Paul Laurence Dunbar

```
It's all a farce,—these tales they tell
  About the breezes sighing,
And moans astir o'er field and dell,
  Because the year is dying.

Such principles are most absurd,—
  I care not who first taught 'em;
There's nothing known to beast or bird
  To make a solemn autumn.

In solemn times, when grief holds sway
  With countenance distressing,
You'll note the more of black and gray
  Will then be used in dressing.

Now purple tints are all around;
  The sky is blue and mellow;
And e'en the grasses turn the ground
  From modest green to yellow.

The seed burs all with laughter crack
  On featherweed and jimson;
And leaves that should be dressed in black
  Are all decked out in crimson.

A butterfly goes winging by;
  A singing bird comes after;
And Nature, all from earth to sky,
  Is bubbling o'er with laughter.

The ripples wimple on the rills,
  Like sparkling little lasses;
The sunlight runs along the hills,
  And laughs among the grasses.

The earth is just so full of fun
  It really can't contain it;
And streams of mirth so freely run
  The heavens seem to rain it.

Don't talk to me of solemn days
  In autumn's time of splendor,
Because the sun shows fewer rays,
  And these grow slant and slender.

Why, it's the climax of the year,—
  The highest time of living!—
Till naturally its bursting cheer
  Just melts into thanksgiving.
```
