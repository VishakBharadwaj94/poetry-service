## Sonnet 44 - Beloved, thou hast brought me many flowers by Elizabeth Barrett Browning

```
Beloved, thou hast brought me many flowers
Plucked in the garden, all the summer through
And winter, and it seemed as if they grew
In this close room, nor missed the sun and showers.
So, in the like name of that love of ours,
Take back these thoughts which here unfolded too,
And which on warm and cold days I withdrew
From my heart's ground. Indeed, those beds and bowers
Be overgrown with bitter weeds and rue,
And wait thy weeding; yet here's eglantine,
Here 's ivy!â€”take them, as I used to do
Thy fowers, and keep them where they shall not pine.
Instruct thine eyes to keep their colors true,
And tell thy soul their roots are left in mine.
```

## As Winds That Blow Against A Star by Joyce Kilmer

```
(For Aline)

Now by what whim of wanton chance
Do radiant eyes know sombre days?
And feet that shod in light should dance
Walk weary and laborious ways?
But rays from Heaven, white and whole,
May penetrate the gloom of earth;
And tears but nourish, in your soul,
The glory of celestial mirth.
The darts of toil and sorrow, sent
Against your peaceful beauty, are
As foolish and as impotent
As winds that blow against a star.
```

The comparison of toil and sorrow to winds blowing against a star emphasizes the futility and insignificance of earthly struggles in the grand scheme of celestial beauty.

### Literary Devices

### Deep Reading

On a deeper level, "As Winds That Blow Against A Star" can be interpreted as a meditation on the paradoxical nature of human experience.

Through the imagery of celestial light piercing earthly gloom and tears nourishing the soul, Kilmer suggests that even in moments of despair, there is a source of inner strength and beauty that can sustain us. The comparison of toil and sorrow to futile winds highlights the insignificance of earthly struggles in the face of divine grace and eternal beauty, inviting readers to reflect on the enduring power of faith and resilience in the midst of adversity.

## Later life by Christina Rossetti

```
Something this foggy day, a something which
Is neither of this fog nor of today,
Has set me dreaming of the winds that play
Past certain cliffs, along one certain beach,
And turn the topmost edge of waves to spray:
Ah pleasant pebbly strand so far away,
So out of reach while quite within my reach,
As out of reach as India or Cathay!
I am sick of where I am and where I am not,
I am sick of foresight and of memory,
I am sick of all I have and all I see,
I am sick of self, and there is nothing new;
Oh weary impatient patience of my lot!
Thus with myself: how fares it, Friends, with you?
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

This longing for a place beyond reach reflects a desire for escape and a search for something more fulfilling.

The imagery in the poem conveys a sense of nostalgia and melancholy. The foggy day serves as a metaphor for the speaker's blurred perception of the present, while the winds and cliffs evoke a sense of movement and change. The image of waves turning into spray conveys a sense of fleeting beauty and impermanence. Overall, the imagery enhances the emotional depth of the poem and creates a vivid sense of atmosphere.

### Literary Devices

Rossetti employs several literary devices in the poem to enhance its impact. The use of enjambment, where a sentence or phrase continues from one line to the next without a pause, creates a sense of fluidity and connection between ideas. For example, in lines 4-5, the enjambment between "beach," and "And turn" emphasizes the continuous motion of the winds along the shore.

The speaker's repetition of the word "sick" in lines 7-8 emphasizes their weariness and dissatisfaction with their current state. This repetition creates a sense of frustration and reinforces the theme of discontentment.

The use of alliteration, such as in "pleasant pebbly strand," adds a musical quality to the poem and draws attention to the speaker's longing for a distant place. Additionally, the use of similes, such as "Ah pleasant pebbly strand so far away," enhances the vividness of the imagery and evokes a sense of longing and nostalgia.

Ultimately, "Later life" invites readers to contemplate the complexities of human emotions and the search for fulfillment in a world filled with longing and uncertainty.
