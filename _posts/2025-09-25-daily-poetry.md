## Trees by Joyce Kilmer

```
(For Mrs. Henry Mills Alden)

I think that I shall never see
A poem lovely as a tree.
A tree whose hungry mouth is prest
Against the earth's sweet flowing breast;
A tree that looks at God all day,
And lifts her leafy arms to pray;
A tree that may in Summer wear
A nest of robins in her hair;
Upon whose bosom snow has lain;
Who intimately lives with rain.
Poems are made by fools like me,
But only God can make a tree.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

In terms of form, Joyce Kilmer's poem "Trees" consists of twelve lines divided into three quatrains. The poem follows a simple ABAB rhyme scheme, with each quatrain ending in a rhyming couplet. The meter is predominantly iambic tetrameter, with four stressed syllables per line. This consistent meter and rhyme scheme give the poem a musical quality, enhancing its lyrical and contemplative nature.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem is the beauty and majesty of nature, specifically the tree. Kilmer celebrates the tree as a symbol of strength, resilience, and connection to the divine. The imagery used throughout the poem evokes a sense of reverence and awe towards nature. The tree is depicted as a living being that sustains life, interacts with the elements, and embodies a spiritual presence. The imagery of the tree's "leafy arms" lifted in prayer and its role as a host to robins and snow conveys a deep sense of interconnectedness with the natural world.

### Literary Devices

Kilmer employs several literary devices in "Trees" to enhance its impact. Personification is used to attribute human qualities to the tree, such as having a "hungry mouth" and "leafy arms." This personification adds depth to the tree's character and highlights its significance in the speaker's eyes. The use of imagery, such as the tree's relationship with the earth, God, and various elements, creates vivid and sensory-rich descriptions that evoke a strong emotional response in the reader. Additionally, the contrast between the speaker's humility in creating poems and God's power in creating trees serves as a powerful rhetorical device that underscores the theme of nature's magnificence.

### Historical and Personal Context

Joyce Kilmer, a devout Catholic poet, wrote "Trees" in 1913 as a tribute to his wife and as a reflection on his faith and the beauty of nature. The poem was published in 1914 and quickly became Kilmer's most famous work. Kilmer's deep connection to nature and his belief in the divine presence in all living things are evident in the poem's reverent depiction of the tree as a symbol of God's creation. The poem's timeless themes of nature's beauty and the divine essence of creation continue to resonate with readers today.

### Deep Reading

At its core, "Trees" can be interpreted as a meditation on the interconnectedness of all life forms and the divine presence in nature. The tree serves as a metaphor for the cycle of life, death, and rebirth, symbolizing the enduring power of creation. By juxtaposing the speaker's creative endeavors with God's creation of the tree, Kilmer emphasizes the humility and insignificance of human art in comparison to the grandeur of the natural world. The poem encourages readers to appreciate the beauty and wisdom of nature and to recognize the sacredness inherent in all living beings. Through its simple yet profound verses, "Trees" invites contemplation on the profound mysteries of existence and the timeless wonder of the natural world.

## Little Brown Baby by Paul Laurence Dunbar

```
Little brown baby wif spa'klin' eyes,
Come to yo' pappy an' set on his knee.
What you been doin', suh -- makin' san' pies?
Look at dat bib -- you's es du'ty ez me.
Look at dat mouf -- dat's merlasses, I bet;
Come hyeah, Maria, an' wipe off his han's.
Bees gwine to ketch you an' eat you up yit,
Bein' so sticky an sweet -- goodness lan's!
Little brown baby wif spa'klin' eyes,
Who's pappy's darlin' an' who's pappy's chile?
Who is it all de day nevah once tries
Fu' to be cross, er once loses dat smile?
Whah did you git dem teef? My, you's a scamp!
Whah did dat dimple come f'om in yo' chin?
Pappy do' know you -- I b'lieves you's a tramp;
Mammy, dis hyeah's some ol' straggler got in!

Let's th'ow him outen de do' in de san',
We do' want stragglers a-layin' 'roun' hyeah;
Let's gin him 'way to de big buggah-man;
I know he's hidin' erroun' hyeah right neah.
Buggah-man, buggah-man, come in de do',
Hyeah's a bad boy you kin have fu' to eat.
Mammy an' pappy do' want him no mo',
Swaller him down f'om his haid to his feet!

Dah, now, I t'ought dat you'd hug me up close.
Go back, ol' buggah, you sha'n't have dis boy.
He ain't no tramp, ner no straggler, of co'se;
He's pappy's pa'dner an' play-mate an' joy.
Come to you' pallet now -- go to yo' res';
Wisht you could allus know ease an' cleah skies;
Wisht you could stay jes' a chile on my breas'--
Little brown baby wif spa'klin' eyes!
```

The poem consists of four stanzas, each with varying line lengths. The irregularity in line lengths gives the poem a sense of conversational tone, as if the speaker is directly addressing the little brown baby. 

The meter in the poem is primarily iambic, with a natural flow that mimics speech patterns. For example, in the first stanza, the lines "Little brown baby wif spa'klin' eyes," and "Come to yo' pappy an' set on his knee," follow this iambic rhythm. 

The rhyme scheme in the poem is AABB, with each stanza having two rhyming couplets. The rhyme scheme adds a musical quality to the poem and helps to tie the stanzas together cohesively.

### Themes and Imagery

One of the central themes in the poem is the love and affection between a parent, presumably the father, and their child, the little brown baby. The speaker expresses adoration for the child through imagery that highlights the child's innocence and charm.

The use of dialect helps to establish a connection between the speaker and the reader, inviting them into the intimate moment shared between the speaker and the child.

## At Home by Christina Rossetti

```
When I was dead, my spirit turned
To seek the much-frequented house:
I passed the door, and saw my friends
Feasting beneath green orange boughs;
From hand to hand they pushed the wine,
They sucked the pulp of plum and peach;
They sang, they jested, and they laughed,
For each was loved of each.

I listened to thier honest chat:
Said one: "To-morrow we shall be
Plod plod along the featureless sands,
And coasting miles and miles of sea."
Said one: "Before the turn of tide
We will achieve the eyrie-seat."
Said one: "To-morrow shall be like
To-day, but much more sweet."

"To-morrow," said they, strong with hope,
And dwelt upon the pleasant way:
"To-morrow," cried they, one and all,
While no one spoke of yesterday.
Their life stood full at blessed noon;
I, only I, had passed away:
"To-morrow and to-day," they cried;
I was of yesterday.

I shivered comfortless, but cast
No chill across the table-cloth;
I, all-forgotten, shivered, sad
To stay, and yet to part how loth:
I passed from the familiar room,
I who from love had passed away,
Like the remembrance of a guest
That tarrieth but a day.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

Christina Rossetti's poem "At Home" consists of three stanzas, each with different lengths: the first stanza has eight lines, the second stanza has nine lines, and the final stanza has eight lines. The poem does not adhere to a strict rhyme scheme, but there are elements of internal rhyme present, such as "chat" and "seat" in the second stanza. The irregularity in stanza length and rhyme scheme mirrors the speaker's disjointed and disoriented emotional state as they observe their friends living their lives without them.

The meter of the poem is primarily iambic with alternating stresses, creating a rhythmic flow that propels the reader through the speaker's observations. The use of enjambment, where sentences and phrases continue onto the next line without a pause, adds to the sense of movement and fluidity within the poem.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of "At Home" revolves around the juxtaposition of life and death, specifically the experience of being forgotten after passing away. The imagery of the speaker's spirit returning to their familiar home only to find their friends feasting and celebrating without them creates a poignant contrast between the vibrancy of the living and the isolation of the dead. The lush imagery of "green orange boughs," "plum and peach," and the idyllic setting of friends enjoying each other's company accentuates the speaker's sense of loneliness and detachment from the world they once knew.

The theme of time is also evident in the poem, as the friends eagerly anticipate "To-morrow" with hope and excitement, while the speaker laments being relegated to the past, stuck in the memories of "yesterday." This contrast between the forward-looking optimism of the living and the backward-looking melancholy of the dead underscores the theme of transience and the inevitability of change.

### Literary Devices

Rossetti employs various literary devices to enhance the emotional impact of the poem. The use of personification is notable in lines such as "my spirit turned" and "I, only I, had passed away," giving agency and emotion to abstract concepts like death and memory. The repetition of the word "To-morrow" throughout the poem serves as a refrain, emphasizing the friends' fixation on the future and highlighting the speaker's sense of estrangement from the present moment.

The imagery of feasting and celebration serves as a symbol of life and vitality, contrasting sharply with the speaker's ghostly presence and sense of displacement. The use of sensory details, such as the taste of wine and fruit, adds depth to the scene and engages the reader's imagination in experiencing the bittersweet nostalgia of the speaker.

### Historical and Personal Context

Christina Rossetti was a Victorian poet known for her introspective and melancholic poetry, often exploring themes of love, death, and spirituality. "At Home" reflects Rossetti's preoccupation with mortality and the afterlife, as well as her interest in the transient nature of human existence. The poem captures the sense of alienation and longing that often characterized Rossetti's work, drawing on her own experiences of loss and grief.

In the context of the Victorian era, themes of death and remembrance were prevalent in literature and art, reflecting the period's fascination with mortality and the spiritual realm. Rossetti's exploration of memory, time, and the passage of life in "At Home" aligns with the broader cultural and philosophical concerns of the Victorian age.

### Deep Reading

"At Home" can be interpreted as a meditation on the nature of memory, identity, and the passage of time. The speaker's ghostly presence among their friends highlights the fragile boundary between life and death, as well as the enduring power of memory to bridge the gap between past and present. The friends' obliviousness to the speaker's absence underscores the ephemeral nature of human relationships and the inevitable process of forgetting that accompanies death.

The speaker's sense of displacement and longing for connection resonates with universal themes of loss and nostalgia, inviting readers to reflect on their own mortality and the legacy they leave behind. Rossetti's evocative language and poignant imagery evoke a sense of melancholy and wistfulness, inviting readers to contemplate the fleeting nature of existence and the enduring power of memory to transcend death.

In conclusion, "At Home" is a haunting and introspective poem that invites readers to confront their own mortality and the complexities of human relationships. Through its vivid imagery, emotional depth, and philosophical musings, the poem resonates with timeless themes of love, loss, and the eternal quest for meaning in the face of mortality.
