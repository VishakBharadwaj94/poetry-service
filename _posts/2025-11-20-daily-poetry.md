## Hayeswater by Matthew Arnold

```
A region desolate and wild.
Black, chafing water: and afloat,
And lonely as a truant child
In a waste wood, a single boat:
No mast, no sails are set thereon;
It moves, but never moveth on:
And welters like a human thing
Amid the wild waves weltering.

Behind, a buried vale doth sleep,
Far down the torrent cleaves its way:
In front the dumb rock rises steep,
A fretted wall of blue and grey;
Of shooting cliff and crumbled stone
With many a wild weed overgrown:
All else, black water: and afloat,
One rood from shore, that single boat.
```

## A Little Budding Rose by Emily Bronte

```
It was a little budding rose,
Round like a fairy globe,
And shyly did its leaves unclose
Hid in their mossy robe,
But sweet was the slight and spicy smell
It breathed from its heart invisible.

The rose is blasted, withered, blighted,
Its root has felt a worm,
And like a heart beloved and slighted,
Failed, faded, shrunk its form.
Bud of beauty, bonnie flower,
I stole thee from thy natal bower.

I was the worm that withered thee,
Thy tears of dew all fell for me;
Leaf and stalk and rose are gone,
Exile earth they died upon.
Yes, that last breath of balmy scent
With alien breezes sadly blent!
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "A Little Budding Rose" by Emily Bronte consists of two stanzas, each with eight lines. It follows a consistent ABAB rhyme scheme in each stanza. The regular rhyme scheme helps to create a sense of harmony and balance in the poem. The meter is mostly iambic tetrameter, with four iambs per line, which gives the poem a smooth and flowing rhythm. This structure reflects the delicate and gentle nature of the rose that is central to the poem.

### Themes and Imagery

One of the central themes of the poem is the fragility and transience of beauty. The imagery of the budding rose, described as "Round like a fairy globe" and "sweet was the slight and spicy smell," conveys a sense of innocence and purity. However, this beauty is contrasted with the harsh reality of decay and destruction. The imagery of the withered rose, described as "blasted, withered, blighted," emphasizes the fleeting nature of life and beauty.

Another theme explored in the poem is betrayal and loss. The speaker reveals that they were the one who caused the rose's demise, likening themselves to a worm that withered the rose. This theme of betrayal is further illustrated through the imagery of the rose being stolen from its natural surroundings and ultimately dying in exile.

### Literary Devices

Bronte employs various literary devices to enhance the poem's themes and imagery. Alliteration can be seen in phrases like "budding rose" and "sweet was the slight and spicy smell," which create a musical quality to the language. Personification is used when the rose is described as having a "heart invisible," giving the flower human-like qualities. The use of simile in comparing the rose to a "fairy globe" adds a touch of whimsy to the description.

### Historical and Personal Context

Emily Bronte, best known for her novel "Wuthering Heights," was a reclusive and introspective writer.

### Deep Reading

## Imitation by Edgar Allan Poe

```
A dark unfathomed tide
Of interminable pride--
A mystery, and a dream,
Should my early life seem;
I say that dream was fraught
With a wild and waking thought
Of beings that have been,
Which my spirit hath not seen,
Had I let them pass me by,
With a dreaming eye!
Let none of earth inherit
That vision on my spirit;
Those thoughts I would control,
As a spell upon his soul:
For that bright hope at last
And that light time have past,
And my wordly rest hath gone
With a sigh as it passed on:
I care not though it perish
With a thought I then did cherish.
```
