## Winter Song by Wilfred Owen

```
The browns, the olives, and the yellows died,
And were swept up to heaven; where they glowed
Each dawn and set of sun till Christmastide,
And when the land lay pale for them, pale-snowed,
Fell back, and down the snow-drifts flamed and flowed.

From off your face, into the winds of winter,
The sun-brown and the summer-gold are blowing;
But they shall gleam with spiritual glinter,
When paler beauty on your brows falls snowing,
And through those snows my looks shall be soft-going.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "Winter Song" by Wilfred Owen consists of two stanzas, each with seven lines. The rhyme scheme in the first stanza is ABABCCB, while the second stanza follows a similar pattern of ABABCDD. The consistent rhyme scheme gives the poem a sense of cohesion and musicality. In terms of meter, the poem does not strictly adhere to a specific pattern, but there is a noticeable rhythm that flows throughout the verses, creating a musical quality. The structure of the poem mirrors the changing seasons, with the first stanza reflecting the transition from autumn to winter, and the second stanza focusing on the imagery of winter itself.

### Themes and Imagery

One of the central themes in "Winter Song" is the cycle of life and death, as symbolized by the changing seasons. The poem opens with the description of the vibrant colors of autumn fading away and being replaced by the cold, white snow of winter. This transition represents the natural order of life, where beauty gives way to decay before being reborn again. The imagery of browns, olives, and yellows dying and then reemerging in the snow captures the cyclical nature of existence.

The poem also explores the idea of transformation and renewal. The speaker describes how the sun-brown and summer-gold will eventually give way to paler beauty and snow, suggesting a shift from external beauty to a deeper, inner radiance. This transformation is not just physical but also spiritual, as indicated by the mention of "spiritual glinter" and the softness of the speaker's looks through the snow.

### Literary Devices

Owen employs various literary devices to enhance the themes and imagery in the poem. One notable device is personification, as seen in the lines "The browns, the olives, and the yellows died, / And were swept up to heaven." By attributing human qualities to colors, Owen creates a vivid and evocative image of autumn fading away. The use of alliteration in phrases like "snow-drifts flamed and flowed" adds to the musical quality of the poem and draws attention to the beauty of the winter landscape.

Another literary device used in the poem is symbolism, particularly in the contrast between the changing seasons and the speaker's relationship with their beloved. The shifting colors and textures of nature mirror the emotional journey of the speaker, as they move from the warmth of summer to the stillness of winter. This symbolism adds depth to the poem and invites readers to consider the layers of meaning beneath the surface.

### Historical and Personal Context

Wilfred Owen, a renowned poet of World War I, is known for his poignant and evocative war poetry. While "Winter Song" does not directly address the horrors of war, it reflects Owen's ability to capture the beauty and transience of life in the midst of conflict. The poem's exploration of themes such as life, death, and renewal resonates with Owen's broader body of work, which often grapples with the fragility of existence and the resilience of the human spirit.

### Deep Reading

In a deeper analysis of "Winter Song," one can interpret the poem as a meditation on the passage of time and the inevitability of change. The shifting seasons serve as a metaphor for the ebb and flow of life, with each stage bringing its own beauty and challenges. The speaker's contemplation of their beloved's changing appearance reflects a broader reflection on the impermanence of youth and external beauty, highlighting the importance of inner qualities and spiritual growth.

Furthermore, the contrast between the external world and the internal landscape of the speaker's emotions invites readers to consider the interplay between nature and human experience. The merging of physical and spiritual elements in the poem suggests a deeper connection between the natural world and the human soul, emphasizing the interconnectedness of all things.

Overall, "Winter Song" offers readers a rich tapestry of themes, imagery, and literary devices that invite contemplation and reflection on the cyclical nature of life and the enduring power of love and beauty. Through its evocative language and profound insights, the poem captures the essence of the changing seasons and the timeless truths that bind us all together.

## Encouragement by Paul Laurence Dunbar

## I many times thought Peace had come by Emily Dickinson

```
I many times thought Peace had come
When Peace was far away --
As Wrecked Men -- deem they sight the Land --
At Centre of the Sea --

And struggle slacker -- but to prove
As hopelessly as I --
How many the fictitious Shores --
Before the Harbor be --
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

This poem by Emily Dickinson consists of three quatrains with a consistent ABCB rhyme scheme. Each stanza contains four lines, with alternating lines rhyming.

The structured form of the poem helps to create a sense of order and control, contrasting with the theme of longing and uncertainty within the content.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem revolves around the speaker's contemplation of peace and its elusive nature. The imagery of a shipwrecked sailor searching for land in the middle of the sea serves as a metaphor for the speaker's own quest for peace in life. The repetition of the idea of being far from peace despite thinking it was near conveys a sense of disillusionment and the difficulty of attaining true peace.

The imagery of the "fictitious Shores" and the distant "Harbor" symbolize the speaker's constant struggle and longing for peace, only to find themselves still far away from it. The vastness of the sea and the endless horizon serve as powerful symbols of the unknown and the unreachable.

### Literary Devices

One significant literary device used in this poem is metaphor.

Additionally, the use of simile in the line "As Wrecked Men -- deem they sight the Land" further emphasizes the speaker's sense of false hope and ultimate disappointment.

The poem also employs repetition, with the repeated mention of peace being far away reinforcing the idea of distance and unattainability. This repetition serves to highlight the speaker's persistent struggle and inability to find peace despite their efforts.

### Historical and Personal Context

Emily Dickinson lived during a time of great social and political upheaval in America, including the Civil War and its aftermath.

Dickinson herself led a reclusive life, and her personal struggles with mental health and relationships may have contributed to the introspective and contemplative nature of her work.

### Deep Reading

At a deeper level, this poem can be seen as a reflection on the human condition and the universal quest for inner peace. The speaker's repeated attempts to find peace, only to realize it is still far away, speak to the common experience of seeking fulfillment and contentment in life. The imagery of the sea and the distant shores can also be interpreted as symbols of the unknowable and the unattainable, highlighting the existential struggle of the individual in a vast and unpredictable world.

Overall, Emily Dickinson's "I many times thought Peace had come" offers a poignant exploration of the complexities of human longing and the elusive nature of true peace. Through its use of metaphor, imagery, and repetition, the poem conveys a sense of yearning and disillusionment that resonates with readers on a deep emotional level.
