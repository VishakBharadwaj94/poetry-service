## The Young Soldier by Wilfred Owen

```
It is not death
Without hereafter
To one in dearth
Of life and its laughter,

Nor the sweet murder
Dealt slow and even
Unto the martyr
Smiling at heaven:

It is the smile
Faint as a (waning) myth,
Faint, and exceeding small
On a boy's murdered mouth.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "The Young Soldier" by Wilfred Owen is structured as a four-stanza poem, each stanza consisting of four lines. The poem does not follow a specific rhyme scheme, allowing for a more free verse form. This lack of rhyme scheme contributes to the overall somber and serious tone of the poem. 

In terms of meter, the poem does not strictly adhere to a specific meter, but rather flows naturally with a mix of iambs and trochees. This irregular meter adds to the feeling of unease and discomfort present throughout the poem.

### Themes and Imagery

The themes of death, sacrifice, and the loss of innocence are prevalent throughout "The Young Soldier." The poem explores the idea of death not as a release from suffering, but as a tragic and senseless loss. The imagery of a young soldier with a faint smile on his face after being murdered highlights the horrors of war and the impact it has on young lives.

The imagery of the soldier's smile being "Faint as a (waning) myth" suggests that even in death, there is a sense of disbelief and surrealism surrounding the loss of life in war. The use of the word "murder" instead of "death" emphasizes the violent and unjust nature of the soldier's demise.

### Literary Devices

Owen utilizes various literary devices to convey the themes of the poem. The use of enjambment in lines such as "Unto the martyr / Smiling at heaven" creates a sense of continuation and fluidity, mirroring the soldier's journey from life to death. 

The repetition of the word "faint" in describing the soldier's smile emphasizes the fleeting nature of life and the fragility of innocence. Additionally, the comparison of the soldier's smile to a "waning myth" adds a layer of complexity to the imagery, suggesting a loss of belief and hope in the face of tragedy.

### Historical and Personal Context

Wilfred Owen was a soldier in World War I, and his experiences in the trenches greatly influenced his poetry. "The Young Soldier" reflects Owen's disillusionment with war and his deep empathy for the soldiers who lost their lives in combat. The poem speaks to the senseless violence and tragedy of war, highlighting the human cost of conflict.

The reference to the soldier smiling at heaven can be seen as a critique of the glorification of war and the idea of martyrdom. Owen challenges the romanticized notions of heroism in war, instead focusing on the devastating impact on individuals and their families.

### Deep Reading

"The Young Soldier" delves into the complexities of death and sacrifice, challenging traditional notions of heroism and martyrdom. The image of a young soldier with a faint smile on his face serves as a poignant reminder of the loss of innocence and the human toll of war. By portraying the soldier as a victim of senseless violence, Owen forces the reader to confront the harsh realities of war and the profound impact it has on individuals.

Overall, the poem serves as a powerful indictment of war and its devastating consequences, urging readers to reflect on the true cost of conflict. Through vivid imagery and poignant language, Owen captures the tragedy of a young life cut short and the profound sorrow that accompanies such loss.

## When First by Edward Thomas

```
WHEN first I came here I had hope,
Hope for I knew not what. Fast beat
My heart at sight of the tall slope
Or grass and yews, as if my feet

Only by scaling its steps of chalk
Would see something no other hill
Ever disclosed. And now I walk
Down it the last time. Never will

My heart beat so again at sight
Of any hill although as fair
And loftier. For infinite
The change, late unperceived, this year,

The twelfth, suddenly, shows me plain.
Hope now,--not health, nor cheerfulness,
Since they can come and go again,
As often one brief hour witnesses,--

Just hope has gone for ever. Perhaps
I may love other hills yet more
Than this: the future and the maps
Hide something I was waiting for.

One thing I know, that love with chance
And use and time and necessity
Will grow, and louder the heart's dance
At parting than at meeting be.
```

## I Wandered Lonely As A Cloud by William Wordsworth

```
I wandered lonely as a cloud
That floats on high o'er vales and hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
A host, of golden daffodils;
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.

Continuous as the stars that shine
And twinkle on the milky way,
They stretched in never-ending line
Along the margin of a bay:
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.

 The waves beside them danced, but they
Out-did the sparkling leaves in glee;
A poet could not be but gay,
In such a jocund company!
I gazed—and gazed—but little thought
What wealth the show to me had brought:

For oft, when on my couch I lie
In vacant or in pensive mood,
They flash upon that inward eye
Which is the bliss of solitude;
And then my heart with pleasure fills,
And dances with the daffodils.
```

### Word Suggestions

Consider these word pairs that complement your poem's tone:

- **nigh** (Germanic) / **close** (Latinate)
  - *While 'nigh' has a more poetic and old-fashioned feel, 'close' is more straightforward and commonly used. 'Nigh' carries a sense of impending or close proximity, adding a touch of mystery and anticipation. On the other hand, 'close' is more concrete and direct, conveying a sense of nearness without the same poetic flair.*
  - **Recommended:** Use the germanic version to enhance your poem's tone

- **blee** (Germanic) / **colour** (Latinate)
  - *'Blee' has a softer and more nostalgic tone, reminiscent of older English language usage. It may evoke a sense of faded or past beauty. In contrast, 'colour' is more precise and commonly used in modern language, lacking the same whimsical and emotive quality as 'blee'.*
  - **Recommended:** Use the germanic version to enhance your poem's tone

- **fatherly** (Germanic) / **paternal** (Latinate)
  - *While both words relate to the role of a father, 'fatherly' feels warmer and more personal, emphasizing the emotional connection between a father and child. 'Paternal' is more formal and clinical, focusing on the biological or legal aspects of fatherhood. In the context of a bittersweet childhood memory, 'fatherly' may evoke a sense of comfort and nurturing that 'paternal' lacks.*
