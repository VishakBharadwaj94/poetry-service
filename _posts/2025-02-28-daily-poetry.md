## The Cry Of The Children by Elizabeth Barrett Browning

```
Do ye hear the children weeping, O my brothers,
Ere the sorrow comes with years?
They are leaning their young heads against their mothers,
And that cannot stop their tears.
The young lambs are bleating in the meadows,
The young birds are chirping in the nest,
The young fawns are playing with the shadows,
The young flowers are blowing toward the west—
But the young, young children, O my brothers,
They are weeping bitterly!
They are weeping in the playtime of the others,
In the country of the free.

Do you question the young children in their sorrow,
Why their tears are falling so?
The old man may weep for his tomorrow,
Which is lost in Long Ago;
The old tree is leafless in the forest,
The old year is ending in the frost,
The old wound, if stricken, is the sorest,
The old hope is hardest to be lost:
But the young, young children, O my brothers,
Do you ask them why they stand
Weeping sore before the bosoms of their mothers,
In our happy Fatherland?

They look up with their pale and sunken faces,
And their looks are sad to see,
For the man's hoary anguish draws and presses
Down the cheeks of infancy;
"Your old earth," they say, "is very dreary;
Our young feet," they say, "are very weak!
Few paces have we taken, yet are weary—
Our grave-rest is very far to seek.
Ask the aged why they weep, and not the children,
For the outside earth is cold,
And we young ones stand without, in our bewildering,
And the graves are for the old."

"True," say the children, "it may happen
That we die before our time.
Little Alice died last year—her grave is shapen
Like a snowball, in the rime.
We looked into the pit prepared to take her:
Was no room for any work in the close clay!
From the sleep wherein she lieth none will wake her,
Crying 'Get up, little Alice! it is day.'
If you listen by that grave, in sun and shower,
With your ear down, little Alice never cries;
Could we see her face, be sure we should not know her,
For the smile has time for growing in her eyes:
And merry go her moments, lulled and stilled in
The shroud by the kirk-chime.
It is good when it happens," say the children,
"That we die before our time."

Alas, alas, the children! They are seeking
Death in life, as best to have;
They are binding up their hearts away from breaking,
With a cerement from the grave.
Go out, children, from the mine and from the city,
Sing out, children, as the little thrushes do;
Pluck your handfuls of the meadow-cowslips pretty,
Laugh aloud, to feel your fingers let them through!
But they answer, "Are your cowslips of the meadows
Like our weeds anear the mine?
Leave us quiet in the dark of the coal-shadows,
From your pleasures fair and fine!

"For oh," say the children, "we are weary,
And we cannot run or leap;
If we cared for any meadows, it were merely
To drop down in them and sleep.
Our knees tremble sorely in the stooping,
We fall upon our faces, trying to go;
And, underneath our heavy eyelids drooping,
The reddest flower would look as pale as snow.
For, all day, we drag our burden tiring
Through the coal-dark, underground;
Or, all day, we drive the wheels of iron
In the factories, round and round.

"For all day the wheels are droning, turning;
Their wind comes in our faces,—
Till our hearts turn, our heads with pulses burning,
And the walls turn in their places:
Turns the sky in the high window blank and reeling,
Turns the long light that drops adown the wall,
Turn the black flies that crawl along the ceiling,—
All are turning, all the day, and we with all.
And all day, the iron wheels are droning,
And sometimes we could pray,
'O ye wheels,' (breaking out in a mad moaning)
'Stop! be silent for today!' "

Ay, be silent! Let them hear each other breathing
For a moment, mouth to mouth!
Let them touch each other's hands, in a fresh wreathing
Of their tender human youth!
Let them feel that this cold metallic motion
Is not all the life God fashions or reveals:
Let them prove their living souls against the notion
That they live in you, or under you, O wheels!
Still, all day, the iron wheels go onward,
Grinding life down from its mark;
And the children's souls, which God is calling sunward,
Spin on blindly in the dark.

Now tell the poor young children, O my brothers,
To look up to Him and pray;
So the blessed One, who blesseth all the others,
Will bless them another day.
They answer, "Who is God that He should hear us,
While the rushing of the iron wheels is stirred?
When we sob aloud, the human creatures near us
Pass by, hearing not, or answer not a word.
And we hear not (for the wheels in their resounding)
Strangers speaking at the door:
Is it likely God, with angels singing round Him,
Hears our weeping any more?

"Two words, indeed, of praying we remember,
And at midnight's hour of harm,
'Our Father,' looking upward in the chamber,
We say softly for a charm.
We know no other words except 'Our Father,'
And we think that, in some pause of angels' song,
God may pluck them with the silence sweet to gather,
And hold both within His right hand which is strong.
'Our Father!' If He heard us, He would surely
(For they call Him good and mild)
Answer, smiling down the steep world very purely,
'Come and rest with me, my child.'

"But, no!" say the children, weeping faster,
"He is speechless as a stone:
And they tell us, of His image is the master
Who commands us to work on.
Go to!" say the children,—"up in heaven,
Dark, wheel-like, turning clouds are all we find.
Do not mock us; grief has made us unbelieving—
We look up for God, but tears have made us blind."
Do you hear the children weeping and disproving,
O my brothers, what ye preach?
For God's possible is taught by His world's loving,
And the children doubt of each.

And well may the children weep before you!
They are weary ere they run;
They have never seen the sunshine, nor the glory
Which is brighter than the sun.
They know the grief of man, without its wisdom;
They sink in man's despair, without its calm,—
Are slaves, without the liberty in Christdom,—
Are martyrs, by the pang without the palm,—
Are worn as if with age, yet unretrievingly
The harvest of its memories cannot reap,—
Are orphans of the earthly love and heavenly.
Let them weep! let them weep!

They look up with their pale and sunken faces,
And their look is dread to see,
For they mind you of their angels in high places,
With eyes turned on Deity;—
"How long," they say, "how long, O cruel nation,
Will you stand, to move the world, on a child's heart,—
Stifle down with a mailed heel its palpitation,
And tread onward to your throne amid the mart?
Our blood splashes upward, O gold-heaper,
And its purple shows your path!
But the child's sob in the silence curses deeper
Than the strong man in his wrath."

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

In "The Cry Of The Children," Elizabeth Barrett Browning utilizes a consistent rhyme scheme of ABAB throughout the poem. The poem is structured in three quatrains followed by a final stanza, creating a sense of order and control that contrasts with the chaotic and heartbreaking subject matter. The meter is predominantly iambic tetrameter, with four beats per line, giving the poem a rhythmic and lyrical quality that enhances its emotional impact. Browning's use of repetition, particularly in phrases like "The young, young children, O my brothers," and "Our Father," adds to the poem's structure and reinforces its themes.

### Themes and Imagery

The central themes of "The Cry Of The Children" revolve around the suffering and exploitation of children in the industrial age. Browning vividly portrays the innocence and vulnerability of children through powerful imagery, such as young lambs bleating, young birds chirping, and young flowers blowing. These images contrast sharply with the harsh realities faced by the children in the poem, who are depicted as weary, oppressed, and deprived of their childhood. The contrast between the natural world and the industrial world serves to highlight the tragic consequences of child labor and societal neglect.

### Literary Devices

Browning employs several literary devices to convey the emotional and thematic depth of the poem. The use of apostrophe in lines like "Do ye hear the children weeping, O my brothers" and "Ay, be silent!" directly addresses the reader, creating a sense of urgency and emotional resonance. The poem also features vivid imagery, such as "Their wind comes in our faces" and "Their wind comes in our faces," which evoke a sense of claustrophobia and oppression. Browning's use of parallelism, as seen in the repeated phrases "The young, young children, O my brothers," and "Our Father," underscores the poem's central concerns and adds to its rhetorical power.

### Historical and Personal Context

Written in the midst of the Victorian era, a time of rapid industrialization and social change, "The Cry Of The Children" reflects Browning's personal experiences and social concerns. Browning was deeply engaged with the political and social issues of her time, particularly the plight of the working class and the exploitation of children in factories and mines. The poem can be seen as a call to action, urging readers to confront the injustices faced by the most vulnerable members of society and to advocate for social reform.

### Deep Reading

At its core, "The Cry Of The Children" is a poignant and powerful indictment of the dehumanizing effects of industrialization on children. Browning's portrayal of the young, innocent victims of exploitation forces the reader to confront the harsh realities of child labor and societal indifference. The repeated refrain of "The young, young children, O my brothers" serves as a haunting reminder of the collective responsibility to protect and nurture the most vulnerable members of society. Through its evocative imagery, emotional resonance, and moral urgency, the poem remains a timeless plea for compassion and social justice.

## The Buried Life by Matthew Arnold

```
Light flows our war of mocking words, and yet,
Behold, with tears mine eyes are wet!
I feel a nameless sadness o'er me roll.
Yes, yes, we know that we can jest,
We know, we know that we can smile!
But there's a something in this breast,
To which thy light words bring no rest,
And thy gay smiles no anodyne.
Give me thy hand, and hush awhile,
And turn those limpid eyes on mine,
And let me read there, love! thy inmost soul.

Alas! is even love too weak
To unlock the heart, and let it speak?
Are even lovers powerless to reveal
To one another what indeed they feel?
I knew the mass of men conceal'd
Their thoughts, for fear that if reveal'd
They would by other men be met
With blank indifference, or with blame reproved;
I knew they lived and moved
Trick'd in disguises, alien to the rest
Of men, and alien to themselves--and yet
The same heart beats in every human breast!

But we, my love!--doth a like spell benumb
Our hearts, our voices?--must we too be dumb?

Ah! well for us, if even we,
Even for a moment, can get free
Our heart, and have our lips unchain'd;
For that which seals them hath been deep-ordain'd!

Fate, which foresaw
How frivolous a baby man would be--
By what distractions he would be possess'd,
How he would pour himself in every strife,
And well-nigh change his own identity--
That it might keep from his capricious play
His genuine self, and force him to obey
Even in his own despite his being's law,
Bade through the deep recesses of our breast
The unregarded river of our life
Pursue with indiscernible flow its way;
And that we should not see
The buried stream, and seem to be
Eddying at large in blind uncertainty,
Though driving on with it eternally.

But often, in the world's most crowded streets,
But often, in the din of strife,
There rises an unspeakable desire
After the knowledge of our buried life;
A thirst to spend our fire and restless force
In tracking out our true, original course;
A longing to inquire
Into the mystery of this heart which beats
So wild, so deep in us--to know
Whence our lives come and where they go.
And many a man in his own breast then delves,
But deep enough, alas! none ever mines.
And we have been on many thousand lines,
And we have shown, on each, spirit and power;
But hardly have we, for one little hour,
Been on our own line, have we been ourselves--
Hardly had skill to utter one of all
The nameless feelings that course through our breast,
But they course on for ever unexpress'd.
And long we try in vain to speak and act
Our hidden self, and what we say and do
Is eloquent, is well--but 't#is not true!
And then we will no more be rack'd
With inward striving, and demand
Of all the thousand nothings of the hour
Their stupefying power;
Ah yes, and they benumb us at our call!
Yet still, from time to time, vague and forlorn,
From the soul's subterranean depth upborne
As from an infinitely distant land,
Come airs, and floating echoes, and convey
A melancholy into all our day.
Only--but this is rare--
When a belov{'e}d hand is laid in ours,
When, jaded with the rush and glare
Of the interminable hours,
Our eyes can in another's eyes read clear,
When our world-deafen'd ear
Is by the tones of a loved voice caress'd--
A bolt is shot back somewhere in our breast,
And a lost pulse of feeling stirs again.
The eye sinks inward, and the heart lies plain,
And what we mean, we say, and what we would, we know.
A man becomes aware of his life's flow,
And hears its winding murmur; and he sees
The meadows where it glides, the sun, the breeze.

And there arrives a lull in the hot race
Wherein he doth for ever chase
That flying and elusive shadow, rest.
An air of coolness plays upon his face,
And an unwonted calm pervades his breast.
And then he thinks he knows
The hills where his life rose,
And the sea where it goes.
```

## Come hither, child by Emily Bronte

```
Come hither, child--who gifted thee
With power to touch that string so well?
How darest thou rouse up thoughts in me,
Thoughts that I would--but cannot quell?

Nay, chide not, lady; long ago
I heard those notes in Ula's hall,
And had I known they'd waken woe
I'd weep their music to recall.

But thus it was: one festal night
When I was hardly six years old
I stole away from crowds and light
And sought a chamber dark and cold.

I had no one to love me there,
I knew no comrade and no friend;
And so I went to sorrow where
Heaven, only heaven saw me bend.

Loud blew the wind; 'twas sad to stay
From all that splendour barred away.
I imaged in the lonely room
A thousand forms of fearful gloom.

And with my wet eyes raised on high
I prayed to God that I might die.
Suddenly in that silence drear
A sound of music reached my ear,

And then a note, I hear it yet,
So full of soul, so deeply sweet,
I thought that Gabriel's self had come
To take me to thy father's home.

Three times it rose, that seraph strain,
Then died, nor breathed again;
But still the words and still the tone
Dwell round my heart when all alone.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme
The poem "Come hither, child" by Emily Bronte consists of four stanzas, each with a varying number of lines (ranging from four to eight). The poem is written in a conversational tone, with the speaker addressing a child who possesses a gift for playing music. There is no strict meter evident in the poem, and the rhyme scheme is irregular, with alternating rhyme in the first stanza (ABAB) and occasional rhyme in the following stanzas. This lack of strict rhyme and meter adds to the conversational and emotional nature of the poem.

### Themes and Imagery
The central theme of the poem revolves around the power of music to evoke deep emotions and memories. The speaker is moved by the child's ability to play the music that stirs up long-buried thoughts and feelings within them. The imagery in the poem is vivid and evocative, painting a picture of a lonely and sorrowful child seeking solace in music. The imagery of darkness, cold, and loneliness in the child's chamber contrasts with the splendor and light of the festal night, highlighting the emotional isolation the child feels.

### Literary Devices
Bronte employs various literary devices in the poem to enhance its emotional impact. One notable device is personification, as the speaker addresses the child and the music as if they possess human qualities. The use of imagery, such as the "thousand forms of fearful gloom" and the "seraph strain," adds depth to the emotional intensity of the poem. Additionally, the repetition of the phrase "Come hither, child" emphasizes the speaker's emotional plea to the child.

### Historical and Personal Context
Emily Bronte, best known for her novel "Wuthering Heights," was a member of the famous Bronte literary family. The themes of loneliness, isolation, and longing for connection present in the poem may reflect Bronte's own experiences of loss and solitude. The reference to Ula's hall could be a fictional or personal reference that adds a mysterious and historical element to the poem.

### Deep Reading
On a deeper level, the poem explores the idea of music as a transcendent force that can connect individuals across time and space. The child's music acts as a conduit for the speaker to access buried emotions and memories, suggesting that art has the power to bridge emotional distances and evoke shared human experiences. The speaker's prayer to die in the midst of loneliness and then being uplifted by the music's celestial quality reflects a profound spiritual journey within the poem. Ultimately, "Come hither, child" delves into the transformative power of music and its ability to heal and uplift the human soul.
