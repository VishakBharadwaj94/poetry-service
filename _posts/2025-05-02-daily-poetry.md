## Eulalie by Edgar Allan Poe

```
             I dwelt alone
             In a world of moan,
         And my soul was a stagnant tide,
Till the fair and gentle Eulalie became my blushing bride--
Till the yellow-haired young Eulalie became my smiling bride.
             Ah, less--less bright
             The stars of the night
         Than the eyes of the radiant girl!
             And never a flake
             That the vapor can make
         With the moon-tints of purple and pearl,
Can vie with the modest Eulalie's most unregarded curl--
Can compare with the bright-eyed Eulalie's most humble and careless
  curl.
             Now Doubt--now Pain
             Come never again,
         For her soul gives me sigh for sigh,
             And all day long
             Shines, bright and strong,
         Astart√© within the sky,
While ever to her dear Eulalie upturns her matron eye--
While ever to her young Eulalie upturns her violet eye.
```

## Love Among the Ruins by Robert Browning

```
Where the quiet-coloured end of evening smiles
    Miles and miles
On the solitary pastures where our sheep
    Half-asleep
Tinkle homeward thro' the twilight, stray or stop
    As they crop--
Was the site once of a city great and gay,
    (So they say)
Of our country's very capital, its prince
    Ages since
Held his court in, gathered councils, wielding far
    Peace or war.

Now,--the country does not even boast a tree,
    As you see,
To distinguish slopes of verdure, certain rills
   From the hills
Intersect and give a name to (else they run
    Into one),
Where the domed and daring palace shot its spires
    Up like fires
O'er the hundred-gated circuit of a wall
    Bounding all,
Made of marble, men might march on nor be pressed,
    Twelve abreast.

And such plenty and perfection, see, of grass
    Never was!
Such a carpet as, this summer-time, o'erspreads
    And embeds
Every vestige of the city, guessed alone,
    Stock or stone--
Where a multitude of men breathed joy and woe
    Long ago;
Lust of glory pricked their hearts up, dread of shame
    Struck them tame;
And that glory and that shame alike, the gold
    Bought and sold.

Now,--the single little turret that remains
    On the plains,
By the caper overrooted, by the gourd
    Overscored,
While the patching houseleek's head of blossom winks
    Thro' the chinks--
Marks the basement whence a tower in ancient time
    Sprang sublime,
And a burning ring, all round, the chariots traced
    As they raced,
And the monarch and his minions and his dames
    Viewed the games.

And I know--while thus the quiet-coloured eve
    Smiles to leave
To their folding, all our many-tinkling fleece
    In such peace,
And the slopes and rills in undistinguished gray
    Melt away--
That a girl with eager eyes and yellow hair
    Waits me there
In the turret whence the charioteers caught soul
    For the goal,
When the king looked, where she looks now, breathless, dumb
    Till I come,

But he looked upon the city, every side,
    Far and wide,
All the mountains topped with temples, all the glades'
    Colonnades,
All the causeys, bridges, aqueducts,--and then,
    All the men!
When I do come, she will speak not, she will stand,
    Either hand
On my shoulder, give her eyes the first embrace
    Of my face,
Ere we rush, ere we extinguish sight and speech
    Each on each.

In one year they sent a million fighters forth
    South and North,
And they built their gods a brazen pillar high
    As the sky,
Yet reserved a thousand chariots in full force--
    Gold, of course.
Oh heart! oh blood that freezes, blood that burns!
    Earth's returns
For whole centuries of folly, noise, and sin!
    Shut them in,
With their triumphs and their glories and the rest!
    Love is best.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

"Love Among the Ruins" by Robert Browning is a dramatic monologue that consists of six stanzas with varying lengths. The poem does not adhere strictly to a specific rhyme scheme or meter, but it does contain some instances of rhyme and rhythm that contribute to the overall musicality of the piece. Browning's use of enjambment creates a flowing and conversational tone, allowing the speaker to narrate their thoughts and emotions in a natural manner. The lack of a strict rhyme scheme reflects the speaker's contemplative and introspective mood as they reflect on the ruins of a once-great city. 

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem revolves around the contrast between past glory and present decay, as well as the enduring power of love amidst ruins. Browning vividly describes the remnants of a once-prosperous city, now reduced to ruins and rubble. The imagery of the deserted landscape, overgrown with grass and devoid of life, creates a sense of desolation and loss. Despite the decay and destruction, the speaker's focus on love, particularly the love of a girl waiting in the turret, highlights the theme of love's enduring nature in the face of destruction and change.

### Literary Devices

Browning employs various literary devices to enhance the poem's themes and imagery. One notable device is personification, as seen in the lines "Where the quiet-coloured end of evening smiles" and "Tinkle homeward thro' the twilight." Personifying nature and inanimate objects adds depth to the description of the setting and creates a sense of life within the ruins. Browning also uses symbolism, such as the image of the solitary turret representing the remnants of past grandeur and the girl symbolizing hope and love in a desolate landscape. Additionally, the repetition of certain phrases like "Love is best" serves to emphasize the poem's central message.

### Historical and Personal Context

Robert Browning wrote "Love Among the Ruins" during the Victorian era, a period marked by rapid industrialization and social change. The poem reflects Browning's interest in history and his fascination with the passage of time. The imagery of a once-great city reduced to ruins may also reflect Browning's personal views on the transient nature of power and wealth. Additionally, the theme of enduring love amidst decay could be influenced by Browning's own romantic relationship with fellow poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning.

### Deep Reading

The poem "Love Among the Ruins" can be interpreted as a meditation on the impermanence of worldly achievements and the enduring nature of love. Through the juxtaposition of past grandeur and present decay, Browning invites readers to reflect on the fleeting nature of human endeavors and the eternal power of love to transcend time and circumstances. The speaker's anticipation of reuniting with the girl in the turret symbolizes the hope and resilience that love can offer in the face of destruction and loss. Ultimately, the poem suggests that while material wealth and glory may fade, love remains a steadfast and enduring force in a changing world.

## Come hither, child by Emily Bronte

```
Come hither, child--who gifted thee
With power to touch that string so well?
How darest thou rouse up thoughts in me,
Thoughts that I would--but cannot quell?

Nay, chide not, lady; long ago
I heard those notes in Ula's hall,
And had I known they'd waken woe
I'd weep their music to recall.

But thus it was: one festal night
When I was hardly six years old
I stole away from crowds and light
And sought a chamber dark and cold.

I had no one to love me there,
I knew no comrade and no friend;
And so I went to sorrow where
Heaven, only heaven saw me bend.

Loud blew the wind; 'twas sad to stay
From all that splendour barred away.
I imaged in the lonely room
A thousand forms of fearful gloom.

And with my wet eyes raised on high
I prayed to God that I might die.
Suddenly in that silence drear
A sound of music reached my ear,

And then a note, I hear it yet,
So full of soul, so deeply sweet,
I thought that Gabriel's self had come
To take me to thy father's home.

Three times it rose, that seraph strain,
Then died, nor breathed again;
But still the words and still the tone
Dwell round my heart when all alone.
```

### Word Suggestions

Consider these word pairs that complement your poem's tone:

- **foe** (Germanic) / **enemy** (Latinate)
  - *The word 'foe' carries a sense of personal animosity and conflict, while 'enemy' feels more formal and distant. 'Foe' conveys a raw, emotional intensity, while 'enemy' is more detached and general.*
  - **Recommended:** Use the germanic version to enhance your poem's tone

- **stretch** (Germanic) / **extend** (Latinate)
  - *'Stretch' implies a physical or metaphorical expansion or reaching beyond limits, suggesting a more organic and fluid movement. 'Extend' has a more technical and precise connotation, focusing on lengthening or prolonging in a structured manner.*
  - **Recommended:** Use the germanic version to enhance your poem's tone

- **nigh** (Germanic) / **close** (Latinate)
  - *'Nigh' has an old-fashioned and poetic feel, evoking a sense of imminent closeness or nearness with a touch of mystery. 'Close' is a more straightforward and common term for proximity, lacking the poetic nuance and emotional resonance of 'nigh'.*
  - **Recommended:** Use the germanic version to enhance your poem's tone
