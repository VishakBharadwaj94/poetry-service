## The Lake by Edgar Allan Poe

```
In spring of youth it was my lot
To haunt of the wide world a spot
The which I could not love the less--
So lovely was the loneliness
Of a wild lake, with black rock bound,
And the tall pines that towered around.

But when the Night had thrown her pall
Upon the spot, as upon all,
And the mystic wind went by
Murmuring in melody--
Then--ah, then, I would awake
To the terror of the lone lake.

Yet that terror was not fright,
But a tremulous delight--
A feeling not the jewelled mine
Could teach or bribe me to define--
Nor Love--although the Love were thine.

Death was in that poisonous wave,
And in its gulf a fitting grave
For him who thence could solace bring
To his lone imagining--
Whose solitary soul could make
An Eden of that dim lake.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "The Lake" by Edgar Allan Poe consists of two stanzas with six lines each. It follows a consistent rhyme scheme of ABABCC, where the first four lines rhyme alternately, and the last two lines rhyme with each other. This structured rhyme scheme adds a musical quality to the poem and enhances its lyrical flow. In terms of meter, the poem does not strictly adhere to a specific meter, but it maintains a rhythmic quality through its use of enjambment and varied line lengths. This lack of strict meter adds to the natural and flowing tone of the poem.

### Themes and Imagery

The dominant themes in "The Lake" are nature, solitude, beauty, and fear. The speaker describes their deep connection to a wild lake surrounded by tall pines and black rock, emphasizing the beauty and loneliness of the setting. The imagery of the lake at night, shrouded in darkness and mystery, evokes a sense of fear and unease in the speaker. The lake becomes a symbol of both terror and delight, representing the dual nature of human emotions and experiences. The contrast between the serene beauty of the lake in daylight and its ominous presence at night highlights the theme of duality in nature and human perception.

### Literary Devices

Poe employs several literary devices in "The Lake" to enhance its emotional impact and create a sense of atmosphere. One prominent device is personification, as seen in the lines "But when the Night had thrown her pall" and "And the mystic wind went by," where night and wind are given human-like qualities. This personification adds depth to the natural elements in the poem and contributes to its eerie mood. Another device used is alliteration, as in "wild lake, with black rock bound," which creates a rhythmic and melodic quality in the description of the setting. Additionally, Poe utilizes symbolism through the lake as a metaphor for solitude, fear, and the darker aspects of human existence.

### Historical and Personal Context

Edgar Allan Poe, known for his macabre and Gothic writing style, often explored themes of death, beauty, and the supernatural in his works. "The Lake" reflects Poe's fascination with the mysterious and the unknown, as well as his personal struggles with loss and isolation. Poe's own experiences of tragedy and loneliness likely influenced the themes of the poem, as he grappled with the complexities of human emotion and existence. The poem can also be seen in the context of Romanticism, with its emphasis on nature, emotion, and the sublime.

### Deep Reading

"The Lake" delves into the intricate relationship between beauty and terror, highlighting the thin line that separates them. The speaker's conflicting emotions towards the lake reveal a deeper exploration of the human psyche and our capacity to find both fear and joy in the same experience. The lake symbolizes the paradox of existence, where darkness and light, fear and delight, coexist in harmony. Through the juxtaposition of these contrasting emotions, Poe invites readers to contemplate the complex nature of human perception and the depths of our innermost fears and desires. Ultimately, "The Lake" serves as a haunting reflection on the dualities of life and the profound mysteries that lie within the human soul.

## The Landing Of The Pilgrim Fathers by Elizabeth Barrett Browning

```
The breaking waves dashed high
On a stern and rock-bound coast,
And the woods, against a stormy sky,
Their giant branches tost;

And the heavy night hung dark
The hills and water o'er,
When a band of exiles moored their bark
On the wild New England shore.

Not as the conqueror comes,
They, the true-hearted, came;
Not with the roll of the stirring drums,
And the trumpet that sings of fame;

Not as the flying come,
In silence and in fear,—
They shook the depths of the desert's gloom
With their hymns of lofty cheer.

Amidst the storm they sang,
And the stars heard and the sea;
And the sounding aisles of the dim woods rang
To the anthem of the free.

The ocean-eagle soared
From his nest by the white wave's foam,
And the rocking pines of the forest roared—
This was their welcome home!

There were men with hoary hair
Amidst that pilgrim band:
Why had they come to wither there,
Away from their childhood's land?

There was woman's fearless eye,
Lit by her deep love's truth;
There was manhood's brow serenely high,
And the fiery heart of youth.

What sought they thus afar?
Bright jewels of the mine?
The wealth of the seas? the spoils of war?—
They sought a faith's pure shrine!

Ay, call it holy ground,
The soil where first they trod!
They have left unstained what there they found—
Freedom to worship God!
```

## The Soldier by Rupert Brooke

```
If I should die, think only this of me:
That there's some corner of a foreign field
That is for ever England. There shall be
In that rich earth a richer dust concealed;
A dust whom England bore, shaped, made aware,
Gave once her flowers to love, her ways to roam;
A body of England's, breathing English air,
Washed by the rivers, blest by suns of home.
And think, this heart, all evil shed away,
A pulse in the eternal mind, no less
Gives somewhere back the thoughts by England given;
Her sights and sounds; dreams happy as her day;
And laughter, learnt of friends; and gentleness,
In hearts at peace, under an English heaven.
```
