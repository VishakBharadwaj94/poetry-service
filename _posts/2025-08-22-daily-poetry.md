## The Sleeper by Edgar Allan Poe

```
At midnight, in the month of June,
I stand beneath the mystic moon.
An opiate vapor, dewy, dim,
Exhales from out her golden rim,
And, softly dripping, drop by drop,
Upon the quiet mountain top,
Steals drowsily and musically
Into the universal valley.
The rosemary nods upon the grave;
The lily lolls upon the wave;
Wrapping the fog about its breast,
The ruin moulders into rest;
Looking like Lethe, see! the lake
A conscious slumber seems to take,
And would not, for the world, awake.
All Beauty sleeps!--and lo! where lies
(Her casement open to the skies)
Irene, with her Destinies!

Oh, lady bright! can it be right--
This window open to the night!
The wanton airs, from the tree-top,
Laughingly through the lattice-drop--
The bodiless airs, a wizard rout,
Flit through thy chamber in and out,
And wave the curtain canopy
So fitfully--so fearfully--
Above the closed and fringed lid
'Neath which thy slumb'ring soul lies hid,
That, o'er the floor and down the wall,
Like ghosts the shadows rise and fall!
Oh, lady dear, hast thou no fear?
Why and what art thou dreaming here?
Sure thou art come o'er far-off seas,
A wonder to these garden trees!
Strange is thy pallor! strange thy dress!
Strange, above all, thy length of tress,
And this all-solemn silentness!

The lady sleeps! Oh, may her sleep
Which is enduring, so be deep!
Heaven have her in its sacred keep!
This chamber changed for one more holy,
This bed for one more melancholy,
I pray to God that she may lie
For ever with unopened eye,
While the dim sheeted ghosts go by!

My love, she sleeps! Oh, may her sleep,
As it is lasting, so be deep;
Soft may the worms about her creep!
Far in the forest, dim and old,
For her may some tall vault unfold--
Some vault that oft hath flung its black
And winged panels fluttering back,
Triumphant, o'er the crested palls,
Of her grand family funerals--
Some sepulchre, remote, alone,
Against whose portal she hath thrown,
In childhood many an idle stone--
Some tomb from out whose sounding door
She ne'er shall force an echo more,
Thrilling to think, poor child of sin!
It was the dead who groaned within.
```

The imagery of the sleeping figure of Irene, surrounded by symbols of decay and mortality, creates a haunting and unsettling atmosphere.

The use of alliteration, assonance, and consonance adds to the musicality of the poem, creating a hypnotic effect that mirrors the theme of sleep and dreams.

## A Little Budding Rose by Emily Bronte

```
It was a little budding rose,
Round like a fairy globe,
And shyly did its leaves unclose
Hid in their mossy robe,
But sweet was the slight and spicy smell
It breathed from its heart invisible.

The rose is blasted, withered, blighted,
Its root has felt a worm,
And like a heart beloved and slighted,
Failed, faded, shrunk its form.
Bud of beauty, bonnie flower,
I stole thee from thy natal bower.

I was the worm that withered thee,
Thy tears of dew all fell for me;
Leaf and stalk and rose are gone,
Exile earth they died upon.
Yes, that last breath of balmy scent
With alien breezes sadly blent!
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "A Little Budding Rose" by Emily Bronte consists of two quatrains, each with a rhyming scheme of ABAB. The poem is written in iambic tetrameter, with lines alternating between eight and seven syllables. This rhythmic pattern creates a gentle and flowing cadence, mirroring the delicate nature of the rose being described. The consistent rhyme scheme and meter contribute to the overall musicality of the poem, enhancing its lyrical quality.

### Themes and Imagery

The central themes of the poem revolve around beauty, fragility, and loss. The initial description of the budding rose as "Round like a fairy globe" and "sweet was the slight and spicy smell" evokes imagery of innocence and purity. However, as the poem progresses, the tone shifts to one of sadness and betrayal as the rose is depicted as "blasted, withered, blighted" due to the actions of the speaker who confesses, "I was the worm that withered thee." The imagery of a once vibrant and beautiful rose now wilted and destroyed conveys themes of impermanence, mortality, and the destructive power of betrayal.

### Literary Devices

Bronte utilizes several literary devices to enhance the poem's emotional impact. Personification is evident in lines such as "And like a heart beloved and slighted," giving human qualities to the rose to convey its sense of betrayal and abandonment. The use of alliteration in phrases like "failed, faded, shrunk" and "Leaf and stalk and rose" creates a sense of rhythm and emphasis, drawing attention to the gradual decay of the rose. Additionally, the imagery of tears of dew falling from the rose symbolizes its sorrow and suffering, adding depth to the poem's emotional resonance.

### Historical and Personal Context

Emily Bronte, known for her introspective and melancholic poetry, often explored themes of nature, love, and loss in her works. Given her reclusive nature and personal struggles, it is possible to interpret the poem as a reflection of her own experiences of isolation and heartache. The imagery of a once vibrant rose being destroyed by betrayal may symbolize the vulnerability of the human heart and the pain of being betrayed by someone trusted.

### Deep Reading

On a deeper level, "A Little Budding Rose" can be seen as a metaphor for the fragility of relationships and the inevitable disillusionment that comes with betrayal. The speaker's confession of being the one who caused the rose's demise highlights the complex emotions of guilt and remorse. The juxtaposition of the rose's initial beauty with its eventual destruction serves as a poignant reminder of the transient nature of life and love. Ultimately, the poem captures the bittersweet essence of beauty tainted by betrayal, inviting readers to contemplate the complexities of human relationships and the consequences of our actions.

## The Sign-Post by Edward Thomas

```
THE dim sea glints chill. The white sun is shy.
And the skeleton weeds and the never-dry,
Rough, long grasses keep white with frost
At the hilltop by the finger-post;
The smoke of the traveller's-joy is puffed
Over hawthorn berry and hazel tuft.

I read the sign. Which way shall I go?
A voice says: You would not have doubted so
At twenty. Another voice gentle with scorn
Says: At twenty you wished you had never been born.

One hazel lost a leaf of gold
From a tuft at the tip, when the first voice told
The other he wished to know what 'twould be
To be sixty by this same post. "You shall see,"
He laughed--and I had to join his laughter--
"You shall see; but either before or after,
Whatever happens, it must befall,
A mouthful of earth to remedy all
Regrets and wishes shall freely be given;
And if there be a flaw in that heaven
'Twill be freedom to wish, and your wish may be
To be here or anywhere talking to me,
No matter what the weather, on earth,
At any age between death and birth,--
To see what day or night can be,
The sun and the frost, the land and the sea,
Summer, Autumn, Winter, Spring,--
With a poor man of any sort, down to a king,
Standing upright out in the air
Wondering where he shall journey, O where?"
```
