## Sonnet 19 - The soul's Rialto hath its merchandise by Elizabeth Barrett Browning

```
XIX

The soul's Rialto hath its merchandise;
I barter curl for curl upon that mart,
And from my poet's forehead to my heart
Receive this lock which outweighs argosies,â€”
As purply black, as erst to Pindar's eyes
The dim purpureal tresses gloomed athwart
The nine white Muse-brows. For this counterpart, . . .
The bay-crown's shade, Beloved, I surmise,
Still lingers on thy curl, it is so black!
Thus, with a fillet of smooth-kissing breath,
I tie the shadows safe from gliding back,
And lay the gift where nothing hindereth;
Here on my heart, as on thy brow, to lack
No natural heat till mine grows cold in death.
```

## The Moon upon her fluent Route by Emily Dickinson

```
The Moon upon her fluent Route
Defiant of a Road --
The Star's Etruscan Argument
Substantiate a God --

If Aims impel these Astral Ones
The ones allowed to know
Know that which makes them as forgot
As Dawn forgets them -- now --
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

In this poem, Emily Dickinson uses a simple structure with four quatrains, each consisting of four lines. The poem does not follow a strict meter, but it has a flowing and rhythmic quality that adds to the dreamy and celestial atmosphere of the piece. The rhyme scheme is ABAB, with alternating end rhymes in each quatrain. This structure allows the poem to flow smoothly and reflect the movement of the moon and stars in the night sky.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem revolves around the celestial bodies of the moon and stars, as well as the idea of divine or higher powers. The moon is depicted as moving effortlessly along its path, defying any earthly roads or constraints. The stars are described as having an "Etruscan Argument" that substantiates a higher power or God. This imagery of the moon and stars conveys a sense of mystery, beauty, and transcendence, suggesting a connection between the natural world and the divine.

### Literary Devices

Dickinson employs several literary devices to enhance the poem's meaning and imagery. One such device is personification, as the moon is described as being "defiant" and the stars engage in an "Etruscan Argument." These personifications give human-like qualities to the celestial bodies, emphasizing their power and significance. Additionally, the use of simile in the comparison of the Astral Ones to Dawn highlights the fleeting nature of their existence. The repetition of the word "forgot" in the final stanza also serves to emphasize the transient nature of these celestial beings.

### Historical and Personal Context

Emily Dickinson was known for her reclusive lifestyle and introspective poetry, often exploring themes of nature, spirituality, and mortality. This poem reflects her fascination with the natural world and her contemplation of the divine. The reference to the "Etruscan Argument" may allude to ancient beliefs in the power of the stars and their influence on human destiny. Dickinson's use of celestial imagery and themes of transcendence align with her personal interest in the mysteries of the universe and the human soul.

### Deep Reading

On a deeper level, "The Moon upon her fluent Route" can be seen as a meditation on the fleeting nature of existence and the eternal cycle of life and death. The moon's continuous movement and the stars' ethereal presence suggest a timeless and cyclical aspect of the universe that transcends human understanding. The poem invites readers to contemplate the interconnectedness of all things and the possibility of a higher power guiding the celestial bodies in their cosmic dance. Ultimately, Dickinson's exploration of the celestial realm serves as a metaphor for the human experience and the quest for meaning in a vast and mysterious universe.
