## The Landing Of The Pilgrim Fathers by Elizabeth Barrett Browning

```
The breaking waves dashed high
On a stern and rock-bound coast,
And the woods, against a stormy sky,
Their giant branches tost;

And the heavy night hung dark
The hills and water o'er,
When a band of exiles moored their bark
On the wild New England shore.

Not as the conqueror comes,
They, the true-hearted, came;
Not with the roll of the stirring drums,
And the trumpet that sings of fame;

Not as the flying come,
In silence and in fear,—
They shook the depths of the desert's gloom
With their hymns of lofty cheer.

Amidst the storm they sang,
And the stars heard and the sea;
And the sounding aisles of the dim woods rang
To the anthem of the free.

The ocean-eagle soared
From his nest by the white wave's foam,
And the rocking pines of the forest roared—
This was their welcome home!

There were men with hoary hair
Amidst that pilgrim band:
Why had they come to wither there,
Away from their childhood's land?

There was woman's fearless eye,
Lit by her deep love's truth;
There was manhood's brow serenely high,
And the fiery heart of youth.

What sought they thus afar?
Bright jewels of the mine?
The wealth of the seas? the spoils of war?—
They sought a faith's pure shrine!

Ay, call it holy ground,
The soil where first they trod!
They have left unstained what there they found—
Freedom to worship God!
```

## Confessions by Robert Browning

```
What is he buzzing in my ears?
  "Now that I come to die,
Do I view the world as a vale of tears?"
  Ah, reverend sir, not I!

What I viewed there once, what I view again
  Where the physic bottles stand
On the table's edge,--is a suburb lane,
  With a wall to my bedside hand.

That lane sloped, much as the bottles do,
  From a house you could descry
O'er the garden-wall: is the curtain blue
  Or green to a healthy eye?

To mine, it serves for the old June weather
  Blue above lane and wall;
And that farthest bottle labelled "Ether"
  Is the house o'er-topping all.

At a terrace, somewhere near the stopper,
  There watched for me, one June,
A girl: I know, sir, it's improper,
  My poor mind's out of tune.

Only, there was a way ... you crept
  Close by the side, to dodge
Eyes in the house, two eyes except:
  They styled their house "The Lodge."

What right had a lounger up their lane?
  But, by creeping very close,
With the good wall's help,--their eyes might strain
  And stretch themselves to Oes,

Yet never catch her and me together,
  As she left the attic, there,
By the rim of the bottle labelled "Ether,"
  And stole from stair to stair

And stood by the rose-wreathed gate. Alas,
  We loved, sir--used to meet;
How sad and bad and mad it was--
  But then, how it was sweet!
```

## She slept beneath a tree by Emily Dickinson

```
She slept beneath a tree --
Remembered but by me.
I touched her Cradle mute --
She recognized the foot --
Put on her carmine suit
And see!
```

The woman is remembered only by the speaker, indicating a personal and intimate connection. The act of touching the woman's cradle, followed by her recognition and transformation into a vibrant figure in a carmine suit, suggests a sense of awakening or rebirth. The imagery of the sleeping woman beneath the tree evokes a sense of tranquility and natural beauty, while the sudden transformation adds an element of surprise and wonder.

### Historical and Personal Context

Emily Dickinson, known for her introspective and often enigmatic poetry, wrote this poem during the mid-19th century.

The depiction of a solitary figure sleeping beneath a tree may also allude to Dickinson's own reclusive nature and her deep introspection.

### Deep Reading

On a deeper level, "She slept beneath a tree" can be interpreted as a metaphor for the cyclical nature of life and the enduring power of memory. The woman's slumber beneath the tree symbolizes a state of dormancy or stasis, while her awakening and transformation suggest a renewal or change. The speaker's role in remembering and recognizing the woman underscores the fragility of memory and the importance of personal connections in shaping one's identity.
