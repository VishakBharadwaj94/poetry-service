## Common Things by Paul Laurence Dunbar

```
I like to hear of wealth and gold,
And El Doradoes in their glory;
I like for silks and satins bold
To sweep and rustle through a story.

The nightingale is sweet of song;
The rare exotic smells divinely;
And knightly men who stride along,
The role heroic carry finely.

But then, upon the other hand,
Our minds have got a way of running
To things that aren't quite so grand,
Which, maybe, we are best in shunning.

For some of us still like to see
The poor man in his dwelling narrow,
The hollyhock, the bumblebee,
The meadow lark, and chirping sparrow.

We like the man who soars and sings
With high and lofty inspiration;
But he who sings of common things
Shall always share our admiration.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "Common Things" by Paul Laurence Dunbar consists of four stanzas, each with six lines. The rhyme scheme of the poem is ABABCC, where the first, second, and fourth lines rhyme, and the third, fifth, and sixth lines rhyme. This rhyme scheme gives the poem a sense of balance and harmony. The meter of the poem is primarily iambic tetrameter, with four stressed syllables per line. This regularity in form contributes to the overall musicality and flow of the poem.

### Themes and Imagery

The themes of the poem revolve around contrasting notions of grandeur and simplicity, wealth and poverty, and sophistication and commonality. The speaker expresses a preference for the beauty found in everyday, ordinary things over the extravagance of wealth and luxury. Through vivid imagery, the poem paints a picture of both opulence ("wealth and gold," "silks and satins bold") and humility ("the poor man in his dwelling narrow," "the hollyhock, the bumblebee"). This juxtaposition highlights the speaker's appreciation for the beauty and value of common, everyday experiences.

### Literary Devices

Dunbar employs several literary devices in the poem to enhance its meaning and impact. Alliteration is used in lines like "silks and satins bold" and "the hollyhock, the bumblebee," emphasizing the contrast between luxury and simplicity. Personification is also present in phrases like "The nightingale is sweet of song" and "The role heroic carry finely," adding depth to the descriptions of nature and human characteristics. Additionally, the use of contrast and imagery helps to convey the speaker's message about the importance of finding beauty in ordinary things.

### Historical and Personal Context

Paul Laurence Dunbar, an African American poet, often wrote about themes of race, identity, and social inequality. In "Common Things," he explores the idea of appreciating simplicity and commonality in a society that often values wealth and status. As a writer who faced discrimination and challenges in his own life, Dunbar may have been drawn to the idea of finding beauty in everyday experiences and the resilience of ordinary people.

### Deep Reading

On a deeper level, "Common Things" can be seen as a commentary on the human experience and the universal desire for connection and meaning. The speaker's preference for the "man who soars and sings" with "high and lofty inspiration" acknowledges the appeal of grandeur and achievement. However, the emphasis on the one "who sings of common things" suggests a deeper appreciation for the simple joys and shared experiences that unite us all. This can be interpreted as a call to recognize the beauty and significance of everyday moments, relationships, and encounters that often go unnoticed in the pursuit of grandeur. Ultimately, the poem encourages readers to value the common things that bind us together and provide a sense of shared humanity.

## 'Mighty Eagle' by Percy Bysshe Shelley

```
SUPPOSED TO BE ADDRESSED TO WILLIAM GODWIN.

Mighty eagle! thou that soarest
O'er the misty mountain forest,
And amid the light of morning
Like a cloud of glory hiest,
And when night descends defiest
The embattled tempests' warning!
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "Mighty Eagle" by Percy Bysshe Shelley is structured in three stanzas, each consisting of six lines. The meter is predominantly iambic tetrameter, with lines alternating between four and three stresses. The rhyme scheme of the poem is ABABCC, giving it a sense of balance and unity.

### Themes and Imagery

The primary themes of the poem revolve around power, freedom, and defiance. The imagery used, particularly that of the mighty eagle soaring over the misty mountain forest and defying the embattled tempests' warning, evokes a sense of grandeur and strength. The eagle is portrayed as a symbol of courage and resilience, bravely facing challenges and rising above them.

### Literary Devices

Shelley employs various literary devices to enhance the poem's impact. Personification is used when the eagle is described as soaring "O'er the misty mountain forest" and defying the tempests' warning. The use of simile in "Like a cloud of glory" heightens the majestic image of the eagle. Additionally, alliteration can be seen in phrases like "light of morning" and "defiest the embattled tempests' warning," adding musicality to the poem.

### Historical and Personal Context

The poem is supposed to be addressed to William Godwin, a political philosopher and writer who was highly influential in Shelley's intellectual development. Given Godwin's radical views on individualism and social justice, it is possible that Shelley is using the imagery of the mighty eagle to symbolize the strength and independence of the individual against oppressive forces. This could reflect Shelley's own revolutionary ideals and his belief in the power of the individual to challenge societal norms.

### Deep Reading

On a deeper level, "Mighty Eagle" can be interpreted as a call to embrace one's inner strength and resilience in the face of adversity. The eagle, with its ability to soar above the challenges of the world, serves as a metaphor for human potential and the capacity to rise above life's obstacles. The poem encourages the reader to embody the spirit of the eagle, to remain steadfast and defiant in the face of adversity, and to strive for greatness despite the challenges that may arise. Ultimately, "Mighty Eagle" serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of courage and perseverance in the pursuit of one's goals.

## Mycerinus by Matthew Arnold

```
'Not by the justice that my father spurn'd,
Not for the thousands whom my father slew,
Altars unfed and temples overturn'd,
Cold hearts and thankless tongues, where thanks are due;
Fell this dread voice from lips that cannot lie,
Stern sentence of the Powers of Destiny.

'I will unfold my sentence and my crime.
My crime--that, rapt in reverential awe,
I sate obedient, in the fiery prime
Of youth, self-govern'd, at the feet of Law;
Ennobling this dull pomp, the life of kings,
By contemplation of diviner things.

'My father loved injustice, and lived long;
Crown'd with grey hairs he died, and full of sway.
I loved the good he scorn'd, and hated wrong--
The Gods declare my recompense to-day.
I look'd for life more lasting, rule more high;
And when six years are measured, lo, I die!

'Yet surely, O my people, did I deem
Man's justice from the all-just Gods was given;
A light that from some upper fount did beam,
Some better archetype, whose seat was heaven;
A light that, shining from the blest abodes,
Did shadow somewhat of the life of Gods.

'Mere phantoms of man's self-tormenting heart,
Which on the sweets that woo it dares not feed!
Vain dreams, which quench our pleasures, then depart
When the duped soul, self-master'd, claims its meed;
When, on the strenuous just man, Heaven bestows,
Crown of his struggling life, an unjust close!

'Seems it so light a thing, then, austere Powers,
To spurn man's common lure, life's pleasant things?
Seems there no joy in dances crown'd with flowers,
Love, free to range, and regal banquetings?
Bend ye on these, indeed, an unmoved eye,
Not Gods but ghosts, in frozen apathy?

'Or is it that some Force, too wise, too strong,
Even for yourselves to conquer or beguile,
Sweeps earth, and heaven, and men, and Gods along,
Like the broad volume of the insurgent Nile?
And the great powers we serve, themselves may be
Slaves of a tyrannous necessity?

'Or in mid-heaven, perhaps, your golden cars,
Where earthly voice climbs never, wing their flight,
And in wild hunt, through mazy tracts of stars,
Sweep in the sounding stillness of the night?
Or in deaf ease, on thrones of dazzling sheen,
Drinking deep draughts of joy, ye dwell serene?

'Oh, wherefore cheat our youth, if thus it be,
Of one short joy, one lust, one pleasant dream?
Stringing vain words of powers we cannot see,
Blind divinations of a will supreme;
Lost labour! when the circumambient gloom
But hides, if Gods, Gods careless of our doom?

'The rest I give to joy. Even while I speak,
My sand runs short; and--as yon star-shot ray,
Hemm'd by two banks of cloud, peers pale and weak,
Now, as the barrier closes, dies away--
Even so do past and future intertwine,
Blotting this six years' space, which yet is mine.

'Six years--six little years--six drops of time!
Yet suns shall rise, and many moons shall wane,
And old men die, and young men pass their prime,
And languid pleasure fade and flower again,
And the dull Gods behold, ere these are flown,
Revels more deep, joy keener than their own.

'Into the silence of the groves and woods
I will go forth; though something would I say--
Something--yet what, I know not; for the Gods
The doom they pass revoke not, nor delay;
And prayers, and gifts, and tears, are fruitless all,
And the night waxes, and the shadows fall.

'Ye men of Egypt, ye have heard your king!
I go, and I return not. But the will
Of the great Gods is plain; and ye must bring
Ill deeds, ill passions, zealous to fulfil
Their pleasure, to their feet; and reap their praise,
The praise of Gods, rich boon! and length of days.'

--So spake he, half in anger, half in scorn;
And one loud cry of grief and of amaze
Broke from his sorrowing people; so he spake,
And turning, left them there; and with brief pause,
Girt with a throng of revellers, bent his way
To the cool region of the groves he loved.
There by the river-banks he wander'd on,
From palm-grove on to palm-grove, happy trees,
Their smooth tops shining sunward, and beneath
Burying their unsunn'd stems in grass and flowers;
Where in one dream the feverish time of youth
Might fade in slumber, and the feet of joy
Might wander all day long and never tire.
Here came the king, holding high feast, at morn,
Rose-crown'd; and ever, when the sun went down,
A hundred lamps beam'd in the tranquil gloom,
From tree to tree all through the twinkling grove,
Revealing all the tumult of the feast--
Flush'd guests, and golden goblets foam'd with wine;
While the deep-burnish'd foliage overhead
Splinter'd the silver arrows of the moon.

It may be that sometimes his wondering soul
From the loud joyful laughter of his lips
Might shrink half startled, like a guilty man
Who wrestles with his dream; as some pale shape
Gliding half hidden through the dusky stems,
Would thrust a hand before the lifted bowl,
Whispering: A little space, and thou art mine!
It may be on that joyless feast his eye
Dwelt with mere outward seeming; he, within,
Took measure of his soul, and knew its strength,
And by that silent knowledge, day by day,
Was calm'd, ennobled, comforted, sustain'd.
It may be; but not less his brow was smooth,
And his clear laugh fled ringing through the gloom,
And his mirth quail'd not at the mild reproof
Sigh'd out by winter's sad tranquillity;
Nor, pall'd with its own fulness, ebb'd and died
In the rich languor of long summer-days;
Nor wither'd when the palm-tree plumes, that roof'd
With their mild dark his grassy banquet-hall,
Bent to the cold winds of the showerless spring;
No, nor grew dark when autumn brought the clouds.

So six long years he revell'd, night and day.
And when the mirth wax'd loudest, with dull sound
Sometimes from the grove's centre echoes came,
To tell his wondering people of their king;
In the still night, across the steaming flats,
Mix'd with the murmur of the moving Nile.
```
