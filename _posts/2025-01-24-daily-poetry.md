## Sympathy by Paul Laurence Dunbar

```
I know what the caged bird feels, alas!
When the sun is bright on the upland slopes;
When the wind stirs soft through the springing grass,
And the river flows like a stream of glass;
When the first bird sings and the first bud opes,
And the faint perfume from its chalice steals--
I know what the caged bird feels!

I know why the caged bird beats his wing
Till its blood is red on the cruel bars;
For he must fly back to his perch and cling
When he fain would be on the bough a-swing;
And a pain still throbs in the old, old scars
And they pulse again with a keener sting--
I know why he beats his wing!

I know why the caged bird sings, ah me,
When his wing is bruised and his bosom sore,--
When he beats his bars and he would be free;
It is not a carol of joy or glee,
But a prayer that he sends from his heart's deep core,
But a plea, that upward to Heaven he flings--
I know why the caged bird sings!
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "Sympathy" by Paul Laurence Dunbar is written in three stanzas, each with seven lines. The rhyme scheme is ABABCCB, with the first, second, and fourth lines rhyming with each other, while the third, fifth, and sixth lines rhyme with each other. This structured rhyme scheme gives the poem a musical quality and creates a sense of unity within each stanza. 

The meter of the poem is primarily in iambic tetrameter, with lines alternating between four and three stressed syllables. This rhythmic pattern contributes to the musicality of the poem and enhances its overall flow. The consistent structure, meter, and rhyme scheme of the poem help to unify the different stanzas and emphasize the recurring themes throughout.

### Themes and Imagery

One of the central themes of the poem is the idea of confinement and the yearning for freedom. The caged bird serves as a powerful metaphor for oppression and the desire to break free from limitations. The imagery of the sun, wind, grass, and river in the first stanza evokes a sense of freedom and natural beauty, contrasting sharply with the caged bird's reality. The vivid descriptions of the bird's physical and emotional pain highlight the contrast between its natural inclination to soar freely and its confined existence.

The poem also explores themes of suffering, resilience, and the power of expression. Through the caged bird's song, Dunbar conveys a sense of defiance in the face of adversity. The bird's music becomes a form of protest and a means of transcending its physical limitations. The imagery of the bird's bruised wing and sore bosom symbolizes the pain and struggle of those who are oppressed, yet its song becomes a powerful symbol of hope and resilience.

### Literary Devices

Dunbar employs various literary devices to enhance the poem's themes and imagery. One notable device is personification, as the caged bird is given human emotions and actions. By attributing feelings of longing, pain, and yearning to the bird, Dunbar humanizes its struggle and makes it relatable to the reader. 

The use of alliteration and assonance, such as in "stream of glass" and "chalice steals," creates a musical quality in the poem and enhances its auditory appeal. The repetition of the phrase "I know" throughout the stanzas emphasizes the speaker's empathy and understanding of the bird's plight.

Additionally, the contrast between the images of freedom and confinement, such as the upland slopes and the cruel bars, serves to underscore the central themes of the poem and evoke a sense of empathy in the reader.

### Historical and Personal Context

Paul Laurence Dunbar, an African American poet, wrote "Sympathy" in the late 19th century, a time of racial segregation and discrimination in the United States. The poem can be interpreted as a commentary on the oppressive conditions faced by African Americans during this period, as well as a universal exploration of the human desire for freedom and self-expression.

As a black poet writing during a time of racial injustice, Dunbar likely drew on his own experiences of discrimination and marginalization to create a poem that resonated with the struggles of his community. "Sympathy" can be seen as a reflection of Dunbar's personal and historical context, highlighting the resilience and humanity of those who are oppressed.

### Deep Reading

At its core, "Sympathy" delves into the complexities of suffering, resilience, and the power of expression. The caged bird symbolizes not only the physical confinement of oppression but also the emotional and psychological toll it takes on the individual. The bird's song becomes a form of resistance, a way to assert its agency and humanity in the face of adversity.

The repeated refrain of "I know" underscores the speaker's deep empathy and understanding of the bird's pain, suggesting a shared sense of suffering and solidarity. Through the imagery of the caged bird's struggle and its defiant song, Dunbar conveys a message of hope and perseverance in the face of injustice.

Ultimately, "Sympathy" invites readers to confront the realities of confinement and oppression, while also celebrating the indomitable spirit that seeks liberation and self-expression. Dunbar's poignant exploration of these themes resonates with readers across time and culture, making the poem a timeless testament to the enduring power of the human spirit.

## The New School by Joyce Kilmer

```
(For My Mother)

The halls that were loud with the merry tread of
young and careless feet
Are still with a stillness that is too drear to seem like holiday,
And never a gust of laughter breaks the calm of the dreaming street
Or rises to shake the ivied walls and frighten the doves away.
The dust is on book and on empty desk, and the
tennis-racquet and balls
Lie still in their lonely locker and wait for a game that is never
played,
And over the study and lecture-room and the river and meadow falls
A stern peace, a strange peace, a peace that War has made.
For many a youthful shoulder now is gay with an
epaulet,
And the hand that was deft with a cricket-bat is defter with a sword,
And some of the lads will laugh to-day where the trench is red and
wet,
And some will win on the bloody field the accolade of the Lord.
They have taken their youth and mirth away
from the study and playing-ground
To a new school in an alien land beneath an alien sky;
Out in the smoke and roar of the fight their lessons and games are
found,
And they who were learning how to live are learning how to die.
And after the golden day has come and the war is
at an end,
A slab of bronze on the chapel wall will tell of the noble dead.
And every name on that radiant list will be the name of a friend,
A name that shall through the centuries in grateful prayers be said.
And there will be ghosts in the old school,
brave ghosts with laughing eyes,
On the field with a ghostly cricket-bat, by the stream with a ghostly
rod;
They will touch the hearts of the living with a flame that sanctifies,
A flame that they took with strong young hands
from the altar-fires of God.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The lack of rhyme and meter contributes to the somber and reflective tone of the poem, allowing the words to flow freely and naturally. The poem consists of four stanzas, each with varying line lengths, contributing to the overall sense of irregularity and disruption caused by war.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem is the impact of war on young students who are forced to leave their carefree school days behind and enter the harsh reality of battle. The imagery in the poem is vivid and poignant, painting a picture of a once lively school now deserted and haunted by the absence of its students. The contrast between the lively past and the desolate present emphasizes the toll that war takes on youth and innocence.

### Literary Devices

Kilmer employs several literary devices to convey the theme of war and its effects. One such device is personification, as seen in lines such as "And they who were learning how to live are learning how to die." This personification highlights the tragic transformation forced upon the young students by the war. Additionally, imagery is used extensively throughout the poem to create a powerful visual and emotional impact on the reader, such as the image of "a ghostly cricket-bat" and "a ghostly rod," symbolizing the lost innocence and youth of the students.

### Historical and Personal Context

Joyce Kilmer wrote this poem during World War I, a time of great turmoil and loss. The poem reflects the personal experiences of Kilmer and his observations of the impact of war on young men who were sent to fight. Kilmer himself tragically lost his life during the war, further adding a personal dimension to the poem's themes of sacrifice and remembrance.

### Deep Reading

The poem suggests that the students who sacrificed their lives in battle will be remembered as heroes, their names etched in bronze and their spirits living on as "brave ghosts with laughing eyes." This idea of sacrifice and remembrance serves as a poignant reminder of the cost of war and the importance of honoring those who have made the ultimate sacrifice. Through its evocative imagery and emotional depth, the poem captures the profound impact of war on individuals and communities, urging readers to remember and honor those who have fallen in service of their country.

## The Scholar Gypsy by Matthew Arnold

```
Go, for they call you, shepherd, from the hill;
Go, shepherd, and untie the wattled cotes!
No longer leave thy wistful flock unfed,
Nor let thy bawling fellows rack their throats,
Nor the cropped herbage shoot another head.
But when the fields are still,
And the tired men and dogs all gone to rest,
And only the white sheep are sometimes seen
Cross and recross the strips of moon-blanched green,
Come, shepherd, and again begin the quest!

Here, where the reaper was at work of late—
In this high field's dark corner, where he leaves
His coat, his basket, and his earthen cruse,
And in the sun all morning binds the sheaves,
Then here, at noon, comes back his stores to use—
Here will I sit and wait,
While to my ear from uplands far away
The bleating of the folded flocks is borne,
With distant cries of reapers in the corn—
All the live murmur of a summer's day.

Screened is this nook o'er the high, half-reaped field,
And here till sundown, shepherd! will I be.
Through the thick corn the scarlet poppies peep,
And round green roots and yellowing stalks I see
Pale pink convolvulus in tendrils creep;
And air-swept lindens yield
Their scent, and rustle down their perfumed showers
Of bloom on the bent grass where I am laid,
And bower me from the August sun with shade;
And the eye travels down to Oxford's towers.

And near me on the grass lies Glanvil's book—
Come, let me read the oft-read tale again!
The story of the Oxford scholar poor,
Of pregnant parts and quick inventive brain,
Who, tired of knocking at preferment's door,
One summer-morn forsook
His friends, and went to learn the gypsy-lore,
And roamed the world with that wild brotherhood,
And came, as most men deemed, to little good,
But came to Oxford and his friends no more.

But once, years after, in the country lanes,
Two scholars, whom at college erst he knew,
Met him, and of his way of life enquired;
Whereat he answered, that the gypsy-crew,
His mates, had arts to rule as they desired
The workings of men's brains,
And they can bind them to what thoughts they will.
"And I," he said, "the secret of their art,
When fully learned, will to the world impart;

But it needs heaven-sent moments for this skill."

This said, he left them, and returned no more.—
But rumours hung about the countryside,
That the lost Scholar long was seen to stray,
Seen by rare glimpses, pensive and tongue-tied,
In hat of antique shape, and cloak of grey,
The same the gypsies wore.
Shepherds had met him on the Hurst in spring;
At some lone alehouse in the Berkshire moors,
On the warm ingle-bench, the smock-frocked boors
Had found him seated at their entering,

But, 'mid their drink and clatter, he would fly.
And I myself seem half to know thy looks,
And put the shepherds, wanderer! on thy trace;
And boys who in lone wheatfields scare the rooks
I ask if thou hast passed their quiet place;

Or in my boat I lie
Moored to the cool bank in the summer-heats,
'Mid wide grass meadows which the sunshine fills,
And watch the warm, green-muffled Cumner hills,
And wonder if thou haunt'st their shy retreats.

For most, I know, thou lov'st retired ground!
Thee at the ferry Oxford riders blithe,
Returning home on summer-nights, have met
Crossing the stripling Thames at Bablock-hithe,
Trailing in the cool stream thy fingers wet,
As the punt's rope chops round;
And leaning backward in a pensive dream,
And fostering in thy lap a heap of flowers
Plucked in the shy fields and distant Wychwood bowers,
And thine eyes resting on the moonlit stream.

And then they land, and thou art seen no more!—
Maidens, who from the distant hamlets come
To dance around the Fyfield elm in May,
Oft through the darkening fields have seen thee roam,
Or cross a stile into the public way.
Oft thou hast given them store
Of flowers—the frail-leafed white anemony,
Dark bluebells drenched with dews of summer eves,
And purple orchises with spotted leaves—
But none hath words she can report of thee.

And, above Godstow Bridge, when hay-time's here
In June, and many a scythe in sunshine flames,
Men who through those wide fields of breezy grass
Where black-winged swallows haunt the glittering Thames,
To bathe in the abandoned lasher pass,
Have often passed thee near
Sitting upon the river bank o'ergrown;
Marked thine outlandish garb, thy figure spare,
Thy dark vague eyes, and soft abstracted air—
But, when they came from bathing, thou wast gone!

At some lone homestead in the Cumner hills,
Where at her open door the housewife darns,
Thou hast been seen, or hanging on a gate
To watch the threshers in the mossy barns.
Children, who early range these slopes and late
For cresses from the rills,
Have known thee eyeing, all an April-day,
The springing pastures and the feeding kine;
And marked thee, when the stars come out and shine,
Through the long dewy grass move slow away.

In autumn, on the skirts of Bagley Wood—
Where most the gypsies by the turf-edged way
Pitch their smoked tents, and every bush you see
With scarlet patches tagged and shreds of grey,
Above the forest-ground called Thessaly—
The blackbird, picking food,
Sees thee, nor stops his meal, nor fears at all;
So often has he known thee past him stray,
Rapt, twirling in thy hand a withered spray,
And waiting for the spark from heaven to fall.

And once, in winter, on the causeway chill
Where home through flooded fields foot-travellers go,
Have I not passed thee on the wooden bridge,
Wrapped in thy cloak and battling with the snow,
Thy face tow'rd Hinksey and its wintry ridge?
And thou hast climbed the hill,
And gained the white brow of the Cumner range;
Turned once to watch, while thick the snowflakes fall,
The line of festal light in Christ-Church hall—
Then sought thy straw in some sequestered grange.


But what—I dream! Two hundred years are flown
Since first thy story ran through Oxford halls,
And the grave Glanvil did the tale inscribe
That thou wert wandered from the studious walls
To learn strange arts, and join a gypsy-tribe;
And thou from earth art gone
Long since, and in some quiet churchyard laid—
Some country-nook, where o'er thy unknown grave
Tall grasses and white flowering nettles wave,
Under a dark, red-fruited yew-tree's shade.

- No, no, thou hast not felt the lapse of hours!
For what wears out the life of mortal men?
'Tis that from change to change their being rolls;
'Tis that repeated shocks, again, again,
Exhaust the energy of strongest souls
And numb the elastic powers.
Till having used our nerves with bliss and teen,
And tired upon a thousand schemes our wit,
To the just-pausing Genius we remit
Our worn-out life, and are—what we have been.

Thou hast not lived, why shouldst thou perish, so?
Thou hadst one aim, one business, one desire;
Else wert thou long since numbered with the dead!
Else hadst thou spent, like other men, thy fire!
The generations of thy peers are fled,
And we ourselves shall go;
But thou possessest an immortal lot,
And we imagine thee exempt from age
And living as thou liv'st on Glanvil's page,
Because thou hadst—what we, alas! have not.

For early didst thou leave the world, with powers
Fresh, undiverted to the world without,
Firm to their mark, not spent on other things;
Free from the sick fatigue, the languid doubt,
Which much to have tried, in much been baffled, brings.
O life unlike to ours!
Who fluctuate idly without term or scope,
Of whom each strives, nor knows for what he strives,
And each half lives a hundred different lives;
Who wait like thee, but not, like thee, in hope.

Thou waitest for the spark from heaven! and we,
Light half-believers of our casual creeds,
Who never deeply felt, nor clearly willed,
Whose insight never has borne fruit in deeds,
Whose vague resolves never have been fulfilled;
For whom each year we see
Breeds new beginnings, disappointments new;
Who hesitate and falter life away,
And lose tomorrow the ground won today—
Ah! do not we, wanderer! await it too?

Yes, we await it!—but it still delays,
And then we suffer! and amongst us one,
Who most has suffered, takes dejectedly
His seat upon the intellectual throne;
And all his store of sad experience he
Lays bare of wretched days;
Tells us his misery's birth and growth and signs,
And how the dying spark of hope was fed,
And how the breast was soothed, and how the head,
And all his hourly varied anodynes.

This for our wisest! and we others pine,
And wish the long unhappy dream would end,
And waive all claim to bliss, and try to bear;
With close-lipped patience for our only friend,
Sad patience, too near neighbour to despair—
But none has hope like thine!
Thou through the fields and through the woods dost stray,
Roaming the countryside, a truant boy,
Nursing thy project in unclouded joy,
And every doubt long blown by time away.

O born in days when wits were fresh and clear,
And life ran gaily as the sparkling Thames;
Before this strange disease of modern life,
With its sick hurry, its divided aims,
Its heads o'ertaxed, its palsied hearts, was rife—
Fly hence, our contact fear!
Still fly, plunge deeper in the bowering wood!
Averse, as Dido did with gesture stern
From her false friend's approach in Hades turn,
Wave us away, and keep thy solitude!

Still nursing the unconquerable hope,
Still clutching the inviolable shade,
With a free, onward impulse brushing through,
By night, the silvered branches of the glade—
Far on the forest-skirts, where none pursue,
On some mild pastoral slope
Emerge, and resting on the moonlit pales
Freshen thy flowers as in former years
With dew, or listen with enchanted ears,
From the dark dingles, to the nightingales!

But fly our paths, our feverish contact fly!
For strong the infection of out mental strife,
Which, though it gives no bliss, yet spoils for rest;
And we should win thee from thy own fair life,
Like us distracted, and like us unblest.
Soon, soon thy cheer would die,
Thy hopes grow timorous, and unfixed thy powers,
Adn thy clear aims be cross and shifting made;
And then thy glad perennial youth would fade,
Fade, and grow old at last, and die like ours.

Then fly our greetings, fly our speech and smiles!
- As some grave Tyrian trader, from the sea,
Descried at sunrise and emerging prow
Lifting the cool-haired creepers stealthily,
The fringes of a southward-facing brow
Among the Aegaean isles;
And saw the merry Grecian coaster come,
Freighted with amber grapes, and Chian wine,
Green, bursting figs, and tunnies steeped in brine—
And knew the intruders on his ancient home,

The young light-hearted masters of the waves—
And snatched his rudder, and shook out more sail;
And day and night held on indignantly
O'er the blue Midland waters with the gale,
Betwixt the Syrtes and soft Sicily,
To where the Atlantic raves
Outside the western straits; and unbent sails
There, where down cloudy cliffs, through sheets of foam,
Shy traffickers, the dark Iberians come;
And on the beach undid his corded bales.

## Today's Writing Challenge

**Form:** Ballad

**Structure:** A narrative poem typically consisting of four-line stanzas with a rhyme scheme of ABAB and a refrain, often telling a tragic or romantic story.

**Rhyme Scheme:** ABAB with a refrain

*Prompt: Write a ballad about a legendary hero's tragic downfall, exploring themes of pride, redemption, and the consequences of one's actions.*

### Word Suggestions

Consider these word pairs that complement your poem's tone:

- **hardship** (Germanic) / **difficulty** (Latinate)
  - *Both words convey the idea of facing challenges, but 'hardship' has a more emotional and personal connotation, emphasizing the suffering and struggle involved. On the other hand, 'difficulty' is more neutral and objective, focusing on the obstacles to be overcome. In the context of a tragic downfall, 'hardship' would evoke a deeper sense of pain and tragedy.*
  - **Recommended:** Use the germanic version to enhance your poem's tone

- **old** (Germanic) / **ancient** (Latinate)
  - *'Old' suggests a general sense of age and the passage of time, while 'ancient' carries a more historical and mythical connotation, implying a deep sense of wisdom and tradition. In a ballad about a legendary hero, 'ancient' would better suit the tone of grandeur and legend, adding a layer of reverence to the hero's story.*
  - **Recommended:** Use the latinate version to enhance your poem's tone

- **worth** (Germanic) / **merit** (Latinate)
  - *While both words relate to value and importance, 'worth' has a more practical and tangible sense, often associated with material value. On the other hand, 'merit' emphasizes the intrinsic qualities or achievements that make something deserving of recognition. In a poem exploring themes of pride and redemption, 'merit' would align better with the introspective and moral dimensions of the hero's downfall.*
  - **Recommended:** Use the latinate version to enhance your poem's tone
