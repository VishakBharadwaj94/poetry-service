## A Birthday by Christina Rossetti

```
My heart is like a singing bird
Whose nest is in a water'd shoot;
My heart is like an apple-tree
Whose boughs are bent with thickset fruit;
My heart is like a rainbow shell
That paddles in a halcyon sea;
My heart is gladder than all these
Because my love is come to me.

Raise me a dais of silk and down;
Hang it with vair and purple dyes;
Carve it in doves and pomegranates,
And peacocks with a hundred eyes;
Work it in gold and silver grapes,
In leaves and silver fleurs-de-lys;
Because the birthday of my life
Is come, my love is come to me.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

In terms of form, Christina Rossetti's poem "A Birthday" consists of two stanzas, each with eight lines. The rhyme scheme in each stanza is ABAB CDCD, giving the poem a structured and rhythmic feel. The meter is primarily iambic tetrameter, with four stressed syllables per line. This regular meter and rhyme scheme contribute to the musicality and flow of the poem.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem is love and the joy it brings. Through vivid imagery, Rossetti compares the speaker's heart to various natural elements such as a singing bird, an apple tree, a rainbow shell, and a dais adorned with luxurious decorations. These images convey a sense of abundance, beauty, and happiness that come with the arrival of love. The use of nature imagery also suggests a deep connection between love and the natural world.

### Literary Devices

Rossetti employs several literary devices in "A Birthday" to enhance its meaning and imagery. One prominent device is metaphor, as seen in lines like "My heart is like a singing bird" and "My heart is like a rainbow shell." These comparisons help to convey the speaker's emotions and the transformative power of love. The poem also features alliteration, as in "boughs are bent," which adds to the musical quality of the verse. Additionally, imagery and symbolism play a significant role in creating a rich and evocative portrait of love and celebration.

### Historical and Personal Context

Christina Rossetti was a Victorian poet known for her introspective and often melancholic verse. "A Birthday" was published in 1861 as part of her collection "Goblin Market and Other Poems." In the context of the Victorian era, the poem's focus on love and joy can be seen as a departure from the more somber themes that often characterized Rossetti's work. It may reflect a personal moment of happiness or inspiration in the poet's life.

### Deep Reading

On a deeper level, "A Birthday" can be interpreted as a celebration of love's transformative power. The speaker's heart, once compared to natural elements, is now described as "gladder than all these" because love has arrived. The elaborate imagery of the second stanza, with its references to silk, doves, pomegranates, and peacocks, suggests a sense of opulence and grandeur associated with the speaker's emotions. The poem ultimately conveys a sense of renewal and abundance that love brings into one's life, making it a fitting tribute to the joy of being loved.

## Not One by Heaven defrauded stay -- by Emily Dickinson

```
Not One by Heaven defrauded stay --
Although he seem to steal
He restitutes in some sweet way
Secreted in his will --
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

Emily Dickinson's poem "Not One by Heaven defrauded stay --" consists of four quatrains, with each stanza following an abcb rhyme scheme. The poem is written in iambic tetrameter, with lines alternating between four and three beats. This consistent rhyme scheme and meter contribute to the poem's musicality and provide a sense of balance and harmony in the structure.

### Themes and Imagery

The theme of restitution and divine justice is central to this poem. The speaker asserts that no one can escape the consequences of their actions, even if they appear to deceive or steal. The idea of restitution is conveyed through the imagery of a person who seems to take without giving back, only to eventually make amends in a "sweet way" that is hidden in their will. This imagery suggests that there is a natural order to the universe in which balance is ultimately restored, even if it may not be immediately apparent.

### Literary Devices

Dickinson employs several literary devices to convey her message effectively. The use of paradox in the opening line, "Not One by Heaven defrauded stay," creates a sense of tension and contradiction that draws the reader's attention. The metaphor of restitution as something "secreted in his will" adds a mysterious and almost magical quality to the idea of making amends. Additionally, the repetition of the sound "s" in "seem to steal" and "Secreted" enhances the musical quality of the poem and creates a sense of unity.

### Historical and Personal Context

Emily Dickinson lived during the mid-19th century in Amherst, Massachusetts, a time and place characterized by religious beliefs and moral values. This context likely influenced her exploration of themes related to divine justice and moral responsibility in her poetry. Dickinson's personal life, marked by periods of isolation and introspection, may have also shaped her perspective on topics such as redemption and accountability.

### Deep Reading

On a deeper level, Dickinson's poem can be seen as a reflection on the complexity of human nature and the intricate workings of the universe. The idea that even those who appear to deceive or take advantage will ultimately have to make amends suggests a belief in a higher power or moral order that governs human behavior. The notion of restitution being "secreted in his will" implies that acts of kindness or reparation may not always be overt or immediately visible, but they are nonetheless essential for maintaining balance and harmony in the world.

In conclusion, Emily Dickinson's "Not One by Heaven defrauded stay --" delves into themes of restitution, divine justice, and moral responsibility through its structured form, vivid imagery, and skillful use of literary devices. The poem invites readers to contemplate the complexities of human behavior and the hidden mechanisms by which balance is maintained in the universe.

## Love Among the Ruins by Robert Browning

```
Where the quiet-coloured end of evening smiles
    Miles and miles
On the solitary pastures where our sheep
    Half-asleep
Tinkle homeward thro' the twilight, stray or stop
    As they crop--
Was the site once of a city great and gay,
    (So they say)
Of our country's very capital, its prince
    Ages since
Held his court in, gathered councils, wielding far
    Peace or war.

Now,--the country does not even boast a tree,
    As you see,
To distinguish slopes of verdure, certain rills
   From the hills
Intersect and give a name to (else they run
    Into one),
Where the domed and daring palace shot its spires
    Up like fires
O'er the hundred-gated circuit of a wall
    Bounding all,
Made of marble, men might march on nor be pressed,
    Twelve abreast.

And such plenty and perfection, see, of grass
    Never was!
Such a carpet as, this summer-time, o'erspreads
    And embeds
Every vestige of the city, guessed alone,
    Stock or stone--
Where a multitude of men breathed joy and woe
    Long ago;
Lust of glory pricked their hearts up, dread of shame
    Struck them tame;
And that glory and that shame alike, the gold
    Bought and sold.

Now,--the single little turret that remains
    On the plains,
By the caper overrooted, by the gourd
    Overscored,
While the patching houseleek's head of blossom winks
    Thro' the chinks--
Marks the basement whence a tower in ancient time
    Sprang sublime,
And a burning ring, all round, the chariots traced
    As they raced,
And the monarch and his minions and his dames
    Viewed the games.

And I know--while thus the quiet-coloured eve
    Smiles to leave
To their folding, all our many-tinkling fleece
    In such peace,
And the slopes and rills in undistinguished gray
    Melt away--
That a girl with eager eyes and yellow hair
    Waits me there
In the turret whence the charioteers caught soul
    For the goal,
When the king looked, where she looks now, breathless, dumb
    Till I come,

But he looked upon the city, every side,
    Far and wide,
All the mountains topped with temples, all the glades'
    Colonnades,
All the causeys, bridges, aqueducts,--and then,
    All the men!
When I do come, she will speak not, she will stand,
    Either hand
On my shoulder, give her eyes the first embrace
    Of my face,
Ere we rush, ere we extinguish sight and speech
    Each on each.

In one year they sent a million fighters forth
    South and North,
And they built their gods a brazen pillar high
    As the sky,
Yet reserved a thousand chariots in full force--
    Gold, of course.
Oh heart! oh blood that freezes, blood that burns!
    Earth's returns
For whole centuries of folly, noise, and sin!
    Shut them in,
With their triumphs and their glories and the rest!
    Love is best.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

Robert Browning's poem "Love Among the Ruins" is written in free verse, with no consistent meter or rhyme scheme. The lack of a formal structure mirrors the theme of decay and loss depicted in the poem. The irregularity in form reflects the chaotic and fragmented state of the ruined city being described. The poem consists of five stanzas, each varying in length, which adds to the sense of disarray and disintegration.

### Themes and Imagery

The central themes of "Love Among the Ruins" revolve around the passage of time, the transience of human achievements, and the enduring power of love. Browning contrasts the former grandeur of the city, now reduced to ruins, with the everlasting nature of love. The imagery of the once magnificent city, now overgrown with grass and devoid of life, serves as a stark reminder of the impermanence of worldly glory. The depiction of the girl waiting in the turret symbolizes the eternal presence of love amidst the ruins of time.

### Literary Devices

Browning employs various literary devices to enhance the themes and imagery of the poem. The use of personification is seen in lines such as "Where the quiet-coloured end of evening smiles," giving human qualities to nature. Imagery is vividly portrayed through descriptions of the city's past grandeur and its present desolation, creating a stark contrast. The repetition of the word "now" throughout the poem emphasizes the contrast between past and present. Browning also uses symbolism, such as the lone turret and the girl waiting within it, to represent enduring love in the face of decay.

### Historical and Personal Context
