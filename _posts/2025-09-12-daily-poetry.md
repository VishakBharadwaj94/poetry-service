## Common Things by Paul Laurence Dunbar

```
I like to hear of wealth and gold,
And El Doradoes in their glory;
I like for silks and satins bold
To sweep and rustle through a story.

The nightingale is sweet of song;
The rare exotic smells divinely;
And knightly men who stride along,
The role heroic carry finely.

But then, upon the other hand,
Our minds have got a way of running
To things that aren't quite so grand,
Which, maybe, we are best in shunning.

For some of us still like to see
The poor man in his dwelling narrow,
The hollyhock, the bumblebee,
The meadow lark, and chirping sparrow.

We like the man who soars and sings
With high and lofty inspiration;
But he who sings of common things
Shall always share our admiration.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "Common Things" by Paul Laurence Dunbar consists of two stanzas with eight lines each, following a regular rhyme scheme of ABABCCDD. The poem is written in iambic tetrameter, with lines alternating between eight and seven syllables. This structured form gives the poem a sense of balance and control, mirroring the contrast between grand and common things explored in the content.

### Themes and Imagery

One of the main themes in the poem is the contrast between grandeur and simplicity, wealth and poverty, exotic and common. The speaker expresses a preference for common things such as the poor man's dwelling, hollyhocks, bumblebees, meadow larks, and chirping sparrows over grandiose and extravagant elements like wealth, gold, silks, and satins. The imagery used throughout the poem evokes a sense of appreciation for the beauty and significance found in ordinary, everyday experiences and objects.

### Literary Devices

Dunbar employs several literary devices in "Common Things" to enhance the poem's meaning and impact. One such device is juxtaposition, as the speaker contrasts the allure of wealth and luxury with the simplicity and charm of common things. Additionally, imagery is used effectively to evoke sensory experiences and create vivid pictures in the reader's mind, such as the sights and sounds of the hollyhock, bumblebee, meadow lark, and chirping sparrow. The repetition of the word "like" emphasizes the speaker's preferences and reinforces the theme of appreciating the beauty in the ordinary.

### Historical and Personal Context

Paul Laurence Dunbar was an African American poet who often explored themes of race, identity, and social issues in his work. In "Common Things," Dunbar's appreciation for the beauty found in everyday life may reflect his own personal experiences growing up in a racially divided society. By celebrating common things and ordinary people, Dunbar may be advocating for the recognition and value of those who are often overlooked or marginalized in society.

### Deep Reading

On a deeper level, "Common Things" can be seen as a commentary on the human tendency to overlook the simple joys and wonders of everyday life in pursuit of grandeur and extravagance. The speaker's admiration for those who sing of common things suggests a deeper appreciation for the authenticity, humility, and connection to nature that these individuals embody. By elevating the ordinary and mundane to a place of honor and admiration, the poem invites readers to reconsider their own values and priorities, reminding them of the beauty and significance found in the common things that surround them.

## Pine-Trees and the Sky: Evening by Rupert Brooke

```
I'd watched the sorrow of the evening sky,
And smelt the sea, and earth, and the warm clover,
And heard the waves, and the seagull's mocking cry.

And in them all was only the old cry,
That song they always sing -- "The best is over!
You may remember now, and think, and sigh,
O silly lover!"
And I was tired and sick that all was over,
And because I,
For all my thinking, never could recover
One moment of the good hours that were over.
And I was sorry and sick, and wished to die.

Then from the sad west turning wearily,
I saw the pines against the white north sky,
Very beautiful, and still, and bending over
Their sharp black heads against a quiet sky.
And there was peace in them; and I
Was happy, and forgot to play the lover,
And laughed, and did no longer wish to die;
Being glad of you, O pine-trees and the sky!
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "Pine-Trees and the Sky: Evening" by Rupert Brooke consists of a single stanza with a total of twenty-one lines. The poem does not follow a specific rhyme scheme, with the lines varying in length and structure. This lack of a consistent rhyme scheme reflects the speaker's scattered thoughts and emotions as they reflect on the passage of time and the fleeting nature of happiness. The irregular structure of the poem mirrors the speaker's inner turmoil and sense of loss.

In terms of meter, the poem does not adhere to a strict metrical pattern. However, there are moments of internal rhyme and alliteration that create a sense of musicality within the poem. For example, in the lines "And heard the waves, and the seagull's mocking cry," the repeated "w" sound creates a sense of rhythm and melody.

### Themes and Imagery

The central themes of the poem revolve around the passage of time, loss, and finding solace in nature. The speaker reflects on the fleeting nature of happiness and the inevitability of change. The evening sky, sea, waves, and seagulls serve as symbols of transience and impermanence. The pine trees against the white north sky symbolize peace, stability, and resilience in the face of change.

The imagery in the poem is vivid and evocative, transporting the reader to the scene described by the speaker. The sensory details of the evening sky, the smell of the sea and clover, and the sound of the waves and seagull's cry create a rich tapestry of emotions. The contrast between the chaotic and melancholic elements of the evening sky and the tranquil beauty of the pine trees against the sky highlights the speaker's shift from despair to peace and contentment.

### Literary Devices

Brooke employs several literary devices throughout the poem to enhance its emotional impact. The repetition of the phrase "the best is over" emphasizes the speaker's sense of loss and regret. The personification of nature, such as the waves and the seagull, adds depth to the imagery and conveys a sense of melancholy.

The use of enjambment, where sentences flow from one line to the next without a pause, creates a sense of continuity and fluidity in the poem. This technique mirrors the fluidity of the speaker's thoughts as they move from despair to acceptance and gratitude.

### Historical and Personal Context

Rupert Brooke was a poet known for his romantic and patriotic themes, often exploring themes of love, loss, and the beauty of nature. "Pine-Trees and the Sky: Evening" reflects Brooke's preoccupation with the passage of time and the fleeting nature of happiness. The poem captures the essence of the early 20th century, a time of great social change and upheaval.

On a personal level, Brooke's own experiences of love and loss likely influenced the emotional depth of the poem. The speaker's longing for the past and eventual acceptance of the present may reflect Brooke's own struggles with nostalgia and regret.

### Deep Reading

At its core, "Pine-Trees and the Sky: Evening" is a meditation on the human experience of loss and the power of nature to bring solace and healing. The contrast between the tumultuous evening sky and the tranquil pine trees symbolizes the duality of human emotions and the cyclical nature of life. The speaker's journey from despair to gratitude highlights the transformative power of nature in providing a sense of peace and acceptance.

Overall, the poem invites readers to reflect on their own experiences of loss and change, and to find comfort in the enduring beauty of the natural world. Brooke's evocative imagery and poignant reflections make "Pine-Trees and the Sky: Evening" a timeless exploration of the complexities of human emotions and the healing power of nature.

## From “Later Life” by Christina Rossetti

```
VI
We lack, yet cannot fix upon the lack:
Not this, nor that; yet somewhat, certainly.
We see the things we do not yearn to see
Around us: and what see we glancing back?
Lost hopes that leave our hearts upon the rack,
Hopes that were never ours yet seem’d to be,
For which we steer’d on life’s salt stormy sea
Braving the sunstroke and the frozen pack.
If thus to look behind is all in vain,
And all in vain to look to left or right,
Why face we not our future once again,
Launching with hardier hearts across the main,
Straining dim eyes to catch the invisible sight,
And strong to bear ourselves in patient pain?

IX
Star Sirius and the Pole Star dwell afar
Beyond the drawings each of other’s strength:
One blazes through the brief bright summer’s length
Lavishing life-heat from a flaming car;
While one unchangeable upon a throne
Broods o’er the frozen heart of earth alone,
Content to reign the bright particular star
Of some who wander or of some who groan.
They own no drawings each of other’s strength,
Nor vibrate in a visible sympathy,
Nor veer along their courses each toward
Yet are their orbits pitch’d in harmony
Of one dear heaven, across whose depth and length
Mayhap they talk together without speech.
```
