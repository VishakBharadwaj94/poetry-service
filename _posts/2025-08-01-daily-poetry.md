## A Day Dream by Emily Bronte

```
On a sunny brae, alone I lay
One summer afternoon;
It was the marriage-time of May
With her young lover, June.

From her mother's heart, seemed loath to part
That queen of bridal charms,
But her father smiled on the fairest child
He ever held in his arms.

The trees did wave their plumy crests,
The glad birds caroled clear;
And I, of all the wedding guests,
Was only sullen there!

There was not one, but wished to shun
My aspect void of cheer;
The very grey rocks, looking on,
Asked, "What do you here?"

And I could utter no reply;
In sooth, I did not know
Why I had brought a clouded eye
To greet the general glow.

So, resting on a heathy bank,
I took my heart to me;
And we together sadly sank
Into a reverie.

We thought, "When winter comes again,
Where will these bright things be?
All vanished, like a vision vain,
An unreal mockery!

The birds that now so blithely sing,
Through deserts, frozen dry,
Poor spectres of the perished spring,
In famished troops, will fly.

And why should we be glad at all?
The leaf is hardly green,
Before a token of its fall
Is on the surface seen!"

Now, whether it were really so,
I never could be sure;
But as in fit of peevish woe,
I stretched me on the moor.

A thousand thousand gleaming fires
Seemed kindling in the air;
A thousand thousand silvery lyres
Resounded far and near:

Methought, the very breath I breathed
Was full of sparks divine,
And all my heather-couch was wreathed
By that celestial shine!

And, while the wide earth echoing rung
To their strange minstrelsy,
The little glittering spirits sung,
Or seemed to sing, to me.

"O mortal! mortal! let them die;
Let time and tears destroy,
That we may overflow the sky
With universal joy!

Let grief distract the sufferer's breast,
And night obscure his way;
They hasten him to endless rest,
And everlasting day.

To thee the world is like a tomb,
A desert's naked shore;
To us, in unimagined bloom,
It brightens more and more!

And could we lift the veil, and give
One brief glimpse to thine eye,
Thou wouldst rejoice for those that live,
Because they live to die."

The music ceased; the noonday dream,
Like dream of night, withdrew;
But Fancy, still, will sometimes deem
Her fond creation true.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

Emily Bronte's poem "A Day Dream" consists of five stanzas, each with four lines, following a consistent ABAB rhyme scheme. The poem is written in iambic tetrameter, with lines alternating between eight and seven syllables. This consistent structure helps create a sense of rhythm and flow throughout the poem, enhancing the dreamlike quality of the speaker's reflections.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem revolves around the fleeting nature of beauty, joy, and life itself. Through vivid imagery, Bronte contrasts the ephemeral nature of the natural world with the eternal existence of the spiritual realm. The changing seasons, the transience of life, and the contrast between earthly and divine beauty all contribute to the overarching theme of impermanence.

The imagery in the poem is rich and evocative, painting a vivid picture of the speaker's surroundings and inner thoughts. From the sunny brae and the marriage-time of May and June to the bleak winter landscape and the celestial shine on the heather-couch, Bronte uses sensory details to transport the reader into the speaker's contemplative state.

### Literary Devices

Bronte employs several literary devices to enhance the meaning and mood of the poem. One notable device is personification, as seen in lines such as "The trees did wave their plumy crests" and "The very grey rocks, looking on." By imbuing elements of nature with human qualities, Bronte creates a sense of intimacy and connection between the speaker and the natural world.

The poem also features symbolism, particularly in the contrast between the earthly realm and the celestial realm. The birds symbolize fleeting joy, while the spirits symbolize eternal joy beyond the physical world. This symbolism adds depth to the poem's exploration of mortality and transcendence.

### Historical and Personal Context

Emily Bronte was part of the Romantic literary movement, which emphasized individualism, emotional expression, and a deep connection to nature. "A Day Dream" reflects these Romantic ideals through its focus on the speaker's inner thoughts and emotions, as well as its portrayal of nature as a source of inspiration and reflection.

Bronte's personal experiences, including the loss of her mother at a young age and her isolated upbringing in the Yorkshire moors, likely influenced the themes of mortality and longing for transcendence in the poem. These personal struggles may have contributed to Bronte's exploration of themes related to death, beauty, and the afterlife in her poetry.

### Deep Reading

At its core, "A Day Dream" is a meditation on the human experience of mortality and the longing for something beyond the physical world. The speaker's musings on the transience of life, the inevitability of death, and the promise of eternal joy reveal a deep sense of introspection and existential questioning.

The celestial imagery in the final stanzas suggests a longing for spiritual transcendence and a belief in a higher, eternal realm beyond earthly suffering. The contrast between the earthly tomb and the imagined bloom of the spiritual realm highlights the speaker's desire for a deeper understanding of life and death.

Overall, "A Day Dream" invites readers to contemplate the fleeting nature of beauty and joy, the inevitability of mortality, and the possibility of spiritual transcendence. Through vivid imagery, evocative language, and deep themes, Emily Bronte crafts a poignant and thought-provoking exploration of the human experience.

## The Thread of Life by Christina Rossetti

```
I
The irresponsive silence of the land,
The irresponsive sounding of the sea,
Speak both one message of one sense to me:--
Aloof, aloof, we stand aloof, so stand
Thou too aloof bound with the flawless band
Of inner solitude; we bind not thee;
But who from thy self-chain shall set thee free?
What heart shall touch thy heart? what hand thy hand?--
And I am sometimes proud and sometimes meek,
And sometimes I remember days of old
When fellowship seemed not so far to seek
And all the world and I seemed much less cold,
And at the rainbow's foot lay surely gold,
And hope felt strong and life itself not weak.

II
Thus am I mine own prison. Everything
Around me free and sunny and at ease:
Or if in shadow, in a shade of trees
Which the sun kisses, where the gay birds sing
And where all winds make various murmuring;
Where bees are found, with honey for the bees;
Where sounds are music, and where silences
Are music of an unlike fashioning.
Then gaze I at the merrymaking crew,
And smile a moment and a moment sigh
Thinking: Why can I not rejoice with you?
But soon I put the foolish fancy by:
I am not what I have nor what I do;
But what I was I am, I am even I.

III
Therefore myself is that one only thing
I hold to use or waste, to keep or give;
My sole possession every day I live,
And still mine own despite Time's winnowing.
Ever mine own, while moons and seasons bring
From crudeness ripeness mellow and sanitive;
Ever mine own, till Death shall ply his sieve;
And still mine own, when saints break grave and sing.
And this myself as king unto my King
I give, to Him Who gave Himself for me;
Who gives Himself to me, and bids me sing
A sweet new song of His redeemed set free;
he bids me sing: O death, where is thy sting?
And sing: O grave, where is thy victory?
```

## Some, too fragile for winter winds by Emily Dickinson

```
Some, too fragile for winter winds
The thoughtful grave encloses --
Tenderly tucking them in from frost
Before their feet are cold.

Never the treasures in her nest
The cautious grave exposes,
Building where schoolboy dare not look,
And sportsman is not bold.

This covert have all the children
Early aged, and often cold,
Sparrow, unnoticed by the Father --
Lambs for whom time had not a fold.
```
