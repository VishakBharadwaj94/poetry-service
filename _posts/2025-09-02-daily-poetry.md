## The Bridge by Edward Thomas

```
I HAVE come a long way to-day:
On a strange bridge alone,
Remembering friends, old friends,
I rest, without smile or moan,
As they remember me without smile or moan.

All are behind, the kind
And the unkind too, no more
To-night than a dream. The stream
Runs softly yet drowns the Past,
The dark-lit stream has drowned the Future and the
   Past.

No traveller has rest more blest
Than this moment brief between
Two lives, when the Night's first lights
And shades hide what has never been,
Things goodlier, lovelier, dearer, than will be or have
   been.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme
The poem "The Bridge" by Edward Thomas consists of a single stanza with eleven lines. It does not follow a specific rhyme scheme or meter, giving it a free verse structure. This lack of rhyme and meter contributes to the contemplative and introspective tone of the poem, allowing the poet to focus on the imagery and themes without being constrained by formal constraints.

### Themes and Imagery
The themes of memory, solitude, and the passage of time are prominent in the poem. The speaker reflects on his past, specifically on old friends who are now only memories. The bridge serves as a metaphor for the transition between two phases of life, where the past is "drowned" by the flowing stream, symbolizing the impermanence of time. The imagery of the stream "softly" running and the Night's lights and shades create a sense of tranquility and introspection, emphasizing the fleeting nature of life.

### Literary Devices
Thomas employs various literary devices in the poem to enhance its meaning. The repetition of the phrase "without smile or moan" emphasizes the sense of detachment and acceptance the speaker feels towards his past and his friends. The use of imagery, such as the stream drowning the past and future, conveys the idea of time's relentless passage and the inevitability of change. The contrast between light and dark in the Night's lights and shades symbolizes the duality of life and the hidden depths of existence.

### Historical and Personal Context
Edward Thomas was a poet who often explored themes of nature, memory, and mortality in his works. He wrote during a time of great social and political upheaval, with World War I looming on the horizon. This context may have influenced his contemplation of time, memory, and the transience of life in "The Bridge." Thomas himself enlisted in the war and tragically died in combat in 1917, adding a layer of personal resonance to his themes of loss and remembrance.

### Deep Reading
At its core, "The Bridge" delves into the universal experience of confronting one's past and accepting the passage of time. The speaker finds solace in the present moment, acknowledging the beauty and significance of what has been and what is yet to come. The bridge becomes a metaphorical space where the speaker can pause and reflect on the complexities of life, finding a sense of peace in the midst of change and uncertainty. Ultimately, the poem invites readers to contemplate their own journey across the bridge of time and the fleeting nature of existence.

## The Valley Of Unrest by Edgar Allan Poe

```
_Once_ it smiled a silent dell
Where the people did not dwell;
They had gone unto the wars,
Trusting to the mild-eyed stars,
Nightly, from their azure towers,
To keep watch above the flowers,
In the midst of which all day
The red sun-light lazily lay,
_Now_ each visitor shall confess
The sad valley's restlessness.
Nothing there is motionless--
Nothing save the airs that brood
Over the magic solitude.
Ah, by no wind are stirred those trees
That palpitate like the chill seas
Around the misty Hebrides!
Ah, by no wind those clouds are driven
That rustle through the unquiet Heaven
Unceasingly, from morn till even,
Over the violets there that lie
In myriad types of the human eye--
Over the lilies that wave
And weep above a nameless grave!
They wave:--from out their fragrant tops
Eternal dews come down in drops.
They weep:--from off their delicate stems
Perennial tears descend in gems.
```

The imagery used by Poe is vivid and evocative, painting a picture of a desolate landscape where even the trees and clouds seem to be in a constant state of agitation.

The imagery of the "chill seas" and "misty Hebrides" creates a sense of coldness and isolation, while the reference to the flowers and graves conveys a feeling of beauty tinged with sorrow. The image of eternal dews and perennial tears falling from the plants adds to the overall sense of melancholy and loss.

The restless and agitated imagery in the poem suggests a sense of unease and disquiet that pervades the natural world. This could be seen as a reflection of Poe's own inner turmoil and existential angst, as well as a commentary on the impermanence of all things.

Overall, "The Valley of Unrest" is a haunting and evocative poem that explores themes of loss, mortality, and the passage of time. Through its vivid imagery and melancholic tone, Poe invites the reader to contemplate the transient nature of life and the haunting beauty of the natural world.

## Merry Autumn by Paul Laurence Dunbar

```
It's all a farce,—these tales they tell
  About the breezes sighing,
And moans astir o'er field and dell,
  Because the year is dying.

Such principles are most absurd,—
  I care not who first taught 'em;
There's nothing known to beast or bird
  To make a solemn autumn.

In solemn times, when grief holds sway
  With countenance distressing,
You'll note the more of black and gray
  Will then be used in dressing.

Now purple tints are all around;
  The sky is blue and mellow;
And e'en the grasses turn the ground
  From modest green to yellow.

The seed burs all with laughter crack
  On featherweed and jimson;
And leaves that should be dressed in black
  Are all decked out in crimson.

A butterfly goes winging by;
  A singing bird comes after;
And Nature, all from earth to sky,
  Is bubbling o'er with laughter.

The ripples wimple on the rills,
  Like sparkling little lasses;
The sunlight runs along the hills,
  And laughs among the grasses.

The earth is just so full of fun
  It really can't contain it;
And streams of mirth so freely run
  The heavens seem to rain it.

Don't talk to me of solemn days
  In autumn's time of splendor,
Because the sun shows fewer rays,
  And these grow slant and slender.

Why, it's the climax of the year,—
  The highest time of living!—
Till naturally its bursting cheer
  Just melts into thanksgiving.
```
