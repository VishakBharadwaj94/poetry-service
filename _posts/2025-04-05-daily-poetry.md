## Sonnet 32 - The first time that the sun rose on thine oath by Elizabeth Barrett Browning

```
The first time that the sun rose on thine oath
To love me, I looked forward to the moon
To slacken all those bonds which seemed too soon
And quickly tied to make a lasting troth.
Quick-loving hearts, I thought, may quickly loathe;
And, looking on myself, I seemed not one
For such man's love!—more like an out-of-tune
Worn viol, a good singer would be wroth
To spoil his song with, and which, snatched in haste,
Is laid down at the first ill-sounding note.
I did not wrong myself so, but I placed
A wrong on thee. For perfect strains may float
'Neath master-hands, from instruments defaced,—
And great souls, at one stroke, may do and doat.
```

## The Barn and the Down by Edward Thomas

```
IT stood in the sunset sky
Like the straight-backed down,
Many a time--the barn
At the edge of the town,

So huge and dark that it seemed
It was the hill
Till the gable's precipice proved
It impossible.

Then the great down in the west
Grew into sight,
A barn stored full to the ridge
With black of night;

And the barn fell to a barn
Or even less
Before critical eyes and its own
Late mightiness.

But far down and near barn and I
Since then have smiled,
Having seen my new cautiousness
By itself beguiled

To disdain what seemed the barn
Till a few steps changed
It past all doubt to the down;
So the barn was avenged.
```

## Would you like summer?  Taste of ours. by Emily Dickinson

```
Would you like summer?  Taste of ours.
Spices?  Buy here!
Ill!  We have berries, for the parching!
Weary!  Furloughs of down!
Perplexed!  Estates of violet trouble ne'er looked on!
Captive!  We bring reprieve of roses!
Fainting!  Flasks of air!
Even for Death, a fairy medicine.
But, which is it, sir?
```
