## The Young Soldier by Wilfred Owen

```
It is not death
Without hereafter
To one in dearth
Of life and its laughter,

Nor the sweet murder
Dealt slow and even
Unto the martyr
Smiling at heaven:

It is the smile
Faint as a (waning) myth,
Faint, and exceeding small
On a boy's murdered mouth.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "The Young Soldier" by Wilfred Owen is structured in four quatrains, each consisting of four lines. The rhyme scheme is ABAB, creating a sense of rhythm and musicality throughout the poem. The meter is mostly iambic, with lines like "It is not death" and "Faint as a myth" following this pattern. This regular structure adds to the poem's coherence and makes it easy to read aloud.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem revolves around the idea of death and the impact it has on the young soldier. Owen explores the concept of death not just as a physical end but as a loss of life's joys and laughter. The imagery used is powerful and evocative, with phrases like "sweet murder" and "boy's murdered mouth" painting a vivid picture of the brutality and tragedy of war. The contrast between the innocence of youth and the harsh reality of death is a recurring motif in Owen's work.

### Literary Devices

Owen employs several literary devices to convey the emotional weight of the poem. The use of alliteration in "sweet murder" and "smiling at heaven" emphasizes the conflicting emotions of pain and acceptance. The repetition of the word "faint" in the final stanza highlights the insignificance of the smile on the young soldier's face, underscoring the sense of loss and tragedy.

### Historical and Personal Context

Wilfred Owen was a soldier in World War I, and his poetry often reflects the horrors and futility of war. "The Young Soldier" is no exception, as it delves into the psychological impact of conflict on young men who are forced to confront death at a young age. Owen's personal experiences on the battlefield undoubtedly influenced his writing, giving his poems a raw and authentic quality that resonates with readers.

### Deep Reading

In "The Young Soldier," Owen captures the essence of youth cut short by war. The juxtaposition of the boy's murdered innocence with the faint smile on his lips creates a poignant and haunting image of loss. The notion of a smile being "faint as a myth" suggests that even in death, there is a lingering trace of hope and humanity. Through his vivid imagery and poignant language, Owen forces the reader to confront the harsh realities of war and the toll it takes on the young soldiers who are caught in its grip. This poem serves as a powerful reminder of the sacrifices made by those who never had the chance to fully experience life's joys and laughter.

## In Memory by Joyce Kilmer

```
I
Serene and beautiful and very wise,
Most erudite in curious Grecian lore,
You lay and read your learned books, and bore
A weight of unshed tears and silent sighs.
The song within your heart could never rise
Until love bade it spread its wings and soar.
Nor could you look on Beauty's face before
A poet's burning mouth had touched your eyes.
Love is made out of ecstasy and wonder;
Love is a poignant and accustomed pain.
It is a burst of Heaven-shaking thunder;
It is a linnet's fluting after rain.
Love's voice is through your song; above and under
And in each note to echo and remain.

II
Because Mankind is glad and brave and young,
Full of gay flames that white and scarlet glow,
All joys and passions that Mankind may know
By you were nobly felt and nobly sung.
Because Mankind's heart every day is wrung
By Fate's wild hands that twist and tear it so,
Therefore you echoed Man's undying woe,
A harp Aeolian on Life's branches hung.
So did the ghosts of toiling children hover
About the piteous portals of your mind;
Your eyes, that looked on glory, could discover
The angry scar to which the world was blind:
And it was grief that made Mankind your lover,
And it was grief that made you love Mankind.

III
Before Christ left the Citadel of Light,
To tread the dreadful way of human birth,
His shadow sometimes fell upon the earth
And those who saw it wept with joy and fright.
"Thou art Apollo, than the sun more bright!"
They cried.  "Our music is of little worth,
But thrill our blood with thy creative mirth
Thou god of song, thou lord of lyric might!"
O singing pilgrim! who could love and follow
Your lover Christ, through even love's despair,
You knew within the cypress-darkened hollow
The feet that on the mountain are so fair.
For it was Christ that was your own Apollo,
And thorns were in the laurel on your hair.
```

The imagery of "A harp Aeolian on Life's branches hung" creates a powerful visual metaphor for the poet's role in expressing the sorrows of mankind.

### Literary Devices

Kilmer employs various literary devices in the poem to enhance its themes and imagery. One such device is alliteration, as seen in the line "A weight of unshed tears and silent sighs," which creates a sense of heaviness and melancholy.

Additionally, Kilmer uses symbolism, such as referencing Apollo and Christ, to explore the relationship between art, divinity, and suffering.

### Historical and Personal Context

The poem was written in the early 20th century when traditional poetic forms were still highly regarded.

The references to Greek mythology and Christian imagery suggest Kilmer's spiritual and intellectual interests, as well as his exploration of the human condition through the lens of ancient myths and religious symbols.

### Deep Reading

A deeper analysis of the poem reveals Kilmer's belief in the transformative power of love and the redemptive quality of art. The poet presents the role of the poet as a mediator between the divine and the human, capable of transmuting grief into beauty through the act of creation. The references to Christ and Apollo suggest a blending of pagan and Christian influences, highlighting the poet's quest for spiritual meaning in a world marked by suffering. Ultimately, "In Memory" is a profound exploration of the poet's vocation and the enduring nature of love and art in the face of human sorrow.

## From Sunset to Star Rise by Christina Rossetti

```
Go from me, summer friends, and tarry not:
I am no summer friend, but wintry cold,
A silly sheep benighted from the fold,
A sluggard with a thorn-choked garden plot.
Take counsel, sever from my lot your lot,
Dwell in your pleasant places, hoard your gold;
Lest you with me should shiver on the wold,
Athirst and hungering on a barren spot.
For I have hedged me with a thorny hedge,
I live alone, I look to die alone:
Yet sometimes, when a wind sighs through the sedge,
Ghosts of my buried years, and friends come back,
My heart goes sighing after swallows flown
On sometime summer's unreturning track.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

### Themes and Imagery

The speaker expresses their solitude and detachment from others, comparing themselves to a "silly sheep benighted from the fold" and a "sluggard with a thorn-choked garden plot." The imagery of the thorny hedge symbolizes the barriers the speaker has erected around themselves, preventing meaningful connections with others. The mention of "Ghosts of my buried years, and friends come back" suggests a longing for the past and a sense of nostalgia.

### Literary Devices

Rossetti employs various literary devices throughout the poem to convey the speaker's emotions and experiences. The use of personification is evident in lines such as "when a wind sighs through the sedge," giving human qualities to natural elements. The repetition of the word "alone" emphasizes the speaker's solitude and isolation. Additionally, the imagery of a "thorny hedge" and a "barren spot" serves as a metaphor for the speaker's emotional barriers and desolation.

### Historical and Personal Context

Christina Rossetti, a Victorian poet, often explored themes of love, loss, and spirituality in her work. As a devout Christian, her poetry often reflects her religious beliefs. In this poem, the speaker's sense of isolation and longing for connection may reflect Rossetti's own struggles with loneliness and introspection. The imagery of nature and the changing seasons may also be influenced by Rossetti's fascination with the natural world and its symbolism.

### Deep Reading

The title "From Sunset to Star Rise" suggests a transition from the end of a day to the beginning of a new one, symbolizing a cycle of endings and beginnings. The speaker's plea for their "summer friends" to leave and not linger highlights their awareness of their own emotional coldness and inability to fully connect with others. The mention of "swallows flown on sometime summer's unreturning track" evokes a sense of loss and longing for a past that can never be reclaimed. Overall, the poem conveys a sense of melancholy and introspection, exploring themes of isolation, nostalgia, and the passage of time.
