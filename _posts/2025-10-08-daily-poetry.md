## My Last Duchess by Robert Browning

```
That's my last Duchess painted on the wall,
Looking as if she were alive. I call
That piece a wonder, now: Frà Pandolf's hands
Worked busily a day, and there she stands.
Will't please you sit and look at her? I said
"Frà Pandolf" by design: for never read
Strangers like you that pictured countenance,
The depth and passion of its earnest glance,
But to myself they turned (since none puts by
The curtain I have drawn for you, but I)
And seemed as they would ask me, if they durst,
How such a glance came there; so, not the first
Are you to turn and ask thus. Sir, 'twas not
Her husband's presence only, called that spot
Of joy into the Duchess' cheek: perhaps
Frà Pandolf chanced to say "Her mantle laps
Over my lady's wrist too much," or "Paint
Must never hope to reproduce the faint
Half-flush that dies along her throat:" such stuff
Was courtesy, she thought, and cause enough
For calling up that spot of joy. She had
A heart--how shall I say?--too soon made glad,
Too easily impressed; she liked whate'er
She looked on, and her looks went everywhere.
Sir, 'twas all one! My favour at her breast,
The dropping of the daylight in the West,
The bough of cherries some officious fool
Broke in the orchard for her, the white mule
She rode with round the terrace--all and each
Would draw from her alike the approving speech,
Or blush, at least. She thanked men,--good! but thanked
Somehow--I know not how--as if she ranked
My gift of a nine-hundred-years-old name
With anybody's gift. Who'd stoop to blame
This sort of trifling? Even had you skill
In speech--(which I have not)--to make your will
Quite clear to such an one, and say, "Just this
Or that in you disgusts me; here you miss,
Or there exceed the mark"--and if she let
Herself be lessoned so, nor plainly set
Her wits to yours, forsooth, and made excuse,
--E'en then would be some stooping: and I choose
Never to stoop. Oh, sir, she smiled, no doubt,
Whene'er I passed her; but who passed without
Much the same smile? This grew; I gave commands;
Then all smiles stopped together. There she stands
As if alive. Will't please you rise? We'll meet
The company below, then. I repeat,
The Count your master's known munificence
Is ample warrant that no just pretence
Of mine for dowry will be disallowed;
Though his fair daughter's self, as I avowed
At starting, is my object. Nay, we'll go
Together down, sir. Notice Neptune, though,
Taming a sea-horse, thought a rarity,
Which Claus of Innsbruck cast in bronze for me!
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "My Last Duchess" by Robert Browning is written in the form of a dramatic monologue, where the speaker, the Duke of Ferrara, reveals his thoughts and feelings to an unidentified listener. The poem is structured in rhyming couplets, with a consistent ABAB rhyme scheme. The meter is predominantly iambic pentameter, which gives the poem a steady and formal rhythm. Browning's use of enjambment, where a sentence or phrase runs over multiple lines, adds to the natural flow of the monologue and creates a conversational tone.

### Themes and Imagery

One of the central themes of the poem is the theme of power and control. The Duke's possessive and controlling nature is evident throughout the poem as he talks about his deceased wife, the Duchess. The imagery of the painting on the wall serves as a symbol of the Duke's need for dominance and his desire to have complete control over his wife's image and reputation even after her death. The recurring image of the Duchess's smile and the Duke's jealousy over it also emphasize the theme of jealousy and insecurity in relationships.

Another theme that emerges from the poem is the theme of art and aesthetics. The Duke's admiration for the painting of his Duchess and his detailed description of the artist's skill and technique highlight his appreciation for beauty and artistry. The poem also explores the idea of art as a means of control and manipulation, as the Duke uses the painting to assert his authority and convey his version of the Duchess's character.

### Literary Devices

Browning employs several literary devices in the poem to enhance its meaning and impact. One notable device is dramatic irony, where the audience knows more than the characters in the poem. The Duke's casual recounting of his wife's fate and his lack of remorse or empathy create a sense of unease and tension for the reader. Alliteration is also used effectively in lines such as "The depth and passion of its earnest glance," emphasizing the intensity of the Duchess's gaze in the painting.

The Duke's use of euphemism and understatement in describing the Duchess's death adds to the chilling effect of the poem. For example, when he mentions that "all smiles stopped together," he subtly reveals that he had his wife killed without explicitly stating it. This use of understatement heightens the sense of horror and reveals the Duke's cold and calculating nature.

### Historical and Personal Context

Robert Browning wrote "My Last Duchess" in the mid-19th century, during the Victorian era, a period known for its strict social conventions and emphasis on propriety. The poem reflects the patriarchal values of the time, where women were often seen as possessions of men and expected to conform to their husbands' expectations. The Duke's sense of entitlement and control over his wife's life and image resonates with the gender dynamics of the Victorian era.

Browning's own personal experiences and relationships may have influenced the creation of the Duke character. Browning himself had a complex and sometimes tumultuous marriage with fellow poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning, and elements of their relationship may have seeped into the portrayal of the Duke's possessiveness and jealousy in the poem.

### Deep Reading

A deeper analysis of the poem reveals the Duke's narcissistic and manipulative nature. His obsession with power and control over his wife is evident in his recounting of her behavior and his reaction to it. The Duke's inability to accept the Duchess's independent spirit and her natural inclination towards joy and beauty ultimately leads to her tragic fate.

The Duke's need for dominance and his disdain for the Duchess's genuine appreciation of life and art expose his own insecurities and lack of emotional depth. The painting of the Duchess becomes a symbol not only of her beauty but also of the Duke's attempt to suppress her individuality and mold her into an object of his desire.

Overall, "My Last Duchess" is a chilling exploration of toxic masculinity, jealousy, and the destructive nature of possessiveness in relationships. Through the Duke's monologue, Browning invites readers to examine the darker aspects of human nature and the consequences of unchecked power and control.

## Disabled by Wilfred Owen

```
He sat in a wheeled chair, waiting for dark,
And shivered in his ghastly suit of grey,
Legless, sewn short at elbow.  Through the park
Voices of boys rang saddening like a hymn,
Voices of play and pleasure after day,
Till gathering sleep had mothered them from him.

About this time Town used to swing so gay
When glow-lamps budded in the light-blue trees
And girls glanced lovelier as the air grew dim,
-- In the old times, before he threw away his knees.
Now he will never feel again how slim
Girls' waists are, or how warm their subtle hands,
All of them touch him like some queer disease.

There was an artist silly for his face,
For it was younger than his youth, last year.
Now he is old; his back will never brace;
He's lost his colour very far from here,
Poured it down shell-holes till the veins ran dry,
And half his lifetime lapsed in the hot race,
And leap of purple spurted from his thigh.
One time he liked a bloodsmear down his leg,
After the matches carried shoulder-high.
It was after football, when he'd drunk a peg,
He thought he'd better join.  He wonders why . . .
Someone had said he'd look a god in kilts.

That's why; and maybe, too, to please his Meg,
Aye, that was it, to please the giddy jilts,
He asked to join.  He didn't have to beg;
Smiling they wrote his lie; aged nineteen years.
Germans he scarcely thought of; and no fears
Of Fear came yet.  He thought of jewelled hilts
For daggers in plaid socks; of smart salutes;
And care of arms; and leave; and pay arrears;
Esprit de corps; and hints for young recruits.
And soon, he was drafted out with drums and cheers.

Some cheered him home, but not as crowds cheer Goal.
Only a solemn man who brought him fruits
Thanked him; and then inquired about his soul.
Now, he will spend a few sick years in Institutes,
And do what things the rules consider wise,
And take whatever pity they may dole.
To-night he noticed how the women's eyes
Passed from him to the strong men that were whole.
How cold and late it is!  Why don't they come
And put him into bed?  Why don't they come?
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "Disabled" by Wilfred Owen is written in free verse, lacking a consistent rhyme scheme or meter. This lack of formal structure mirrors the chaotic and fragmented nature of the veteran's thoughts and experiences. The poem consists of seven stanzas, each varying in length, contributing to the overall sense of disorder and disarray in the protagonist's life.

### Themes and Imagery

One of the central themes of the poem is the devastating impact of war on individuals, specifically focusing on physical and emotional disabilities resulting from combat. The imagery used by Owen is vivid and haunting, painting a picture of a young man who has lost his limbs and his sense of self. The contrast between the memories of his past life, full of joy and vitality, and his current reality of isolation and despair is stark and poignant.

The imagery of the disabled soldier sitting in a wheelchair, watching the world go by, serves as a powerful symbol of the alienation and disconnection felt by many veterans. The references to girls' waists and warm hands highlight the loss of physical intimacy and human connection that the protagonist now faces. The image of the soldier waiting in vain for someone to come and put him to bed at the end of the poem conveys a sense of abandonment and helplessness.

### Literary Devices

Owen employs various literary devices to convey the emotional weight of the veteran's experiences. The use of simile is evident in lines such as "All of them touch him like some queer disease," comparing the way people interact with the disabled soldier to an illness. This comparison underscores the protagonist's feelings of being ostracized and viewed differently by society.

The repetition of the phrase "Why don't they come" at the end of the poem creates a sense of desperation and longing for comfort and companionship. This repetition serves to emphasize the soldier's isolation and the lack of empathy and understanding from those around him.

### Historical and Personal Context

Wilfred Owen himself was a soldier in World War I, which heavily influenced his poetry. "Disabled" reflects the harsh realities of war and the toll it takes on individuals, both physically and mentally. The poem captures the disillusionment and despair experienced by many veterans who returned home from the front lines with life-altering injuries.

The mention of Germans in the poem suggests the setting of World War I, a conflict marked by brutal trench warfare and high casualty rates. The references to uniforms, drills, and military rituals provide insight into the regimented and dehumanizing nature of war.

### Deep Reading

At its core, "Disabled" delves into the profound loss of identity and purpose experienced by the disabled soldier. The contrast between his former youthful vigor and his current state of brokenness serves as a poignant commentary on the destructive nature of war. The poem raises questions about society's treatment of its veterans and the lasting effects of trauma on individuals.

The title itself, "Disabled," carries a weighty significance, encapsulating not only the physical disabilities of the protagonist but also the emotional and psychological scars that he carries. Through the soldier's internal reflections and external interactions, Owen sheds light on the harsh realities faced by those who have sacrificed their bodies and minds in service of their country.

In conclusion, "Disabled" by Wilfred Owen is a powerful and poignant portrayal of the physical and emotional devastation wrought by war. Through its vivid imagery, evocative language, and poignant themes, the poem challenges readers to confront the human cost of conflict and the lasting impact it has on individuals long after the guns have fallen silent.

## From “Later Life” by Christina Rossetti

```
VI
We lack, yet cannot fix upon the lack:
Not this, nor that; yet somewhat, certainly.
We see the things we do not yearn to see
Around us: and what see we glancing back?
Lost hopes that leave our hearts upon the rack,
Hopes that were never ours yet seem’d to be,
For which we steer’d on life’s salt stormy sea
Braving the sunstroke and the frozen pack.
If thus to look behind is all in vain,
And all in vain to look to left or right,
Why face we not our future once again,
Launching with hardier hearts across the main,
Straining dim eyes to catch the invisible sight,
And strong to bear ourselves in patient pain?

IX
Star Sirius and the Pole Star dwell afar
Beyond the drawings each of other’s strength:
One blazes through the brief bright summer’s length
Lavishing life-heat from a flaming car;
While one unchangeable upon a throne
Broods o’er the frozen heart of earth alone,
Content to reign the bright particular star
Of some who wander or of some who groan.
They own no drawings each of other’s strength,
Nor vibrate in a visible sympathy,
Nor veer along their courses each toward
Yet are their orbits pitch’d in harmony
Of one dear heaven, across whose depth and length
Mayhap they talk together without speech.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

In terms of form, "From Later Life" by Christina Rossetti consists of two separate sections within the poem: VI and IX. Each section explores different aspects of life and existence. The poem is written in a structured form with a consistent rhyme scheme. The rhyme scheme in section VI is ABABCCDD, while in section IX, it is ABABCDCD. This structured rhyme scheme adds to the overall flow of the poem and creates a sense of continuity.

The meter in the poem varies between iambic pentameter and iambic tetrameter, creating a rhythmic and melodic quality. For instance, in section VI, lines like "Lost hopes that leave our hearts upon the rack" and "Braving the sunstroke and the frozen pack" contain a strong iambic pentameter pattern. This rhythmic structure enhances the contemplative mood of the poem and allows the reader to engage with the themes presented.

### Themes and Imagery

One of the central themes in the poem is the idea of reflection and introspection in later life. Rossetti explores the concept of looking back on past experiences, lost hopes, and missed opportunities. The imagery of "life's salt stormy sea" in section VI evokes a sense of struggle and perseverance in the face of challenges. The use of nautical imagery, such as steering through storms and braving the elements, reflects the journey of life and the resilience required to navigate its uncertainties.

In section IX, the theme of distance and connection is prominent. The contrast between the distant stars Sirius and the Pole Star symbolizes the idea of separation and unity. The imagery of Sirius "lavishing life-heat from a flaming car" and the Pole Star "brooding o'er the frozen heart of earth alone" conveys a sense of balance and harmony in the universe. This imagery serves as a metaphor for the interconnectedness of all things, despite their apparent differences.

### Literary Devices

Rossetti employs various literary devices to enhance the depth and complexity of the poem. In section VI, the use of paradox in the lines "We lack, yet cannot fix upon the lack: / Not this, nor that; yet somewhat, certainly" creates a sense of ambiguity and mystery. This paradoxical language conveys the idea of searching for meaning and purpose in life, even when the answers remain elusive.

Additionally, the use of personification in section IX, where the stars are described as owning "no drawings each of other's strength," adds a layer of anthropomorphism to the celestial bodies. This personification allows the stars to symbolize human relationships and connections, highlighting the universal themes of unity and separation in the poem.

### Historical and Personal Context

As a woman living in the 19th century, Rossetti faced societal expectations and constraints that influenced her writing. In "From Later Life," Rossetti reflects on the passage of time and the complexities of aging, drawing on her personal experiences and observations of the world around her.

The historical context of the Victorian era, with its emphasis on morality, duty, and tradition, likely influenced Rossetti's contemplation of themes such as regret, resilience, and interconnectedness. The poem can be seen as a reflection of the societal norms and values of the time, while also challenging conventional ideas about aging and introspection.

### Deep Reading

Through a deeper analysis of "From Later Life," it becomes evident that Rossetti is exploring the philosophical question of existence and purpose. The repeated references to searching for meaning, facing the future with courage, and finding harmony in the universe suggest a profound meditation on life's journey and the human experience.

The juxtaposition of past regrets and future possibilities in the poem conveys a sense of hope and renewal, urging the reader to confront their fears and uncertainties with resilience. The celestial imagery of the stars serves as a metaphor for the interconnectedness of all beings and the eternal nature of existence.

Overall, "From Later Life" invites readers to contemplate the complexities of aging, reflection, and interconnectedness, offering a poignant reflection on the passage of time and the enduring search for meaning in a vast and mysterious universe.

### Word Suggestions

Consider these word pairs that complement your poem's tone:

- **abandon** (Germanic) / **relinquish** (Latinate)
  - *While both words convey the idea of letting go, 'abandon' carries a more emotional and abrupt connotation, suggesting a sense of desertion or disregard. On the other hand, 'relinquish' has a more formal and deliberate tone, implying a voluntary giving up or surrendering. For a poem focused on tranquility and beauty, 'relinquish' would better suit the tone by emphasizing a peaceful and intentional release.*
  - **Recommended:** Use the latinate version to enhance your poem's tone

- **freedom** (Germanic) / **liberty** (Latinate)
  - *'Freedom' conveys a sense of personal autonomy and the absence of restraint, while 'liberty' emphasizes a broader concept of rights and social freedom. 'Freedom' has a more colloquial and direct feel, while 'liberty' carries a more formal and legalistic tone. Considering the reflective and serene mood of the poem, 'liberty' would be more suitable as it adds a touch of elegance and universality to the imagery.*
  - **Recommended:** Use the latinate version to enhance your poem's tone

- **small** (Germanic) / **minute** (Latinate)
  - *Both 'small' and 'minute' describe something of diminutive size, but 'small' is a common, straightforward term, while 'minute' has a more precise and delicate connotation. 'Small' is practical and everyday, while 'minute' suggests a careful and meticulous attention to detail. For a poem that aims to capture the delicate interplay of light and nature's awakening, 'minute' would be the better choice to enhance the sense of intricacy and precision.*
  - **Recommended:** Use the latinate version to enhance your poem's tone
