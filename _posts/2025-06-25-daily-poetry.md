## Sonnet 33 - Yes, call me by my pet-name! let me hear by Elizabeth Barrett Browning

```
Yes, call me by my pet-name! let me hear
The name I used to run at, when a child,
From innocent play, and leave the cowslips piled,
To glance up in some face that proved me dear
With the look of its eyes. I miss the clear
Fond voices which, being drawn and reconciled
Into the music of Heaven's undefiled,
Call me no longer. Silence on the bier,
While I call God—call God!—So let thy mouth
Be heir to those who are now exanimate.
Gather the north flowers to complete the south,
And catch the early love up in the late.
Yes, call me by that name,—and I, in truth,
With the same heart, will answer and not wait.
```

## Hymn by Edgar Allan Poe

```
At morn--at noon--at twilight dim--
Maria! thou hast heard my hymn!
In joy and wo--in good and ill--
Mother of God, be with me still!
When the Hours flew brightly by,
And not a cloud obscured the sky,
My soul, lest it should truant be,
Thy grace did guide to thine and thee
Now, when storms of Fate o'ercast
Darkly my Present and my Past,
Let my future radiant shine
With sweet hopes of thee and thine!
```

## Faith and Despondency by Emily Bronte

```
The winter wind is loud and wild,
Come close to me, my darling child;
Forsake thy books, and mateless play;
And, while the night is gathering grey,
We'll talk its pensive hours away;--

'Ierne, round our sheltered hall
November's gusts unheeded call;
Not one faint breath can enter here
Enough to wave my daughter's hair,
And I am glad to watch the blaze
Glance from her eyes, with mimic rays;
To feel her cheek so softly pressed,
In happy quiet on my breast.

'But, yet, even this tranquillity
Brings bitter, restless thoughts to me;
And, in the red fire's cheerful glow,
I think of deep glens, blocked with snow;
I dream of moor, and misty hill,
Where evening closes dark and chill;
For, lone, among the mountains cold,
Lie those that I have loved of old.
And my heart aches, in hopeless pain
Exhausted with repinings vain,
That I shall greet them ne'er again!'

'Father, in early infancy,
When you were far beyond the sea,
Such thoughts were tyrants over me!
I often sat, for hours together,
Through the long nights of angry weather,
Raised on my pillow, to descry
The dim moon struggling in the sky;

Or, with strained ear, to catch the shock,
Of rock with wave, and wave with rock;
So would I fearful vigil keep,
And, all for listening, never sleep.
But this world's life has much to dread,
Not so, my Father, with the dead.

'Oh! not for them, should we despair,
The grave is drear, but they are not there;
Their dust is mingled with the sod,
Their happy souls are gone to God!
You told me this, and yet you sigh,
And murmur that your friends must die.
Ah! my dear father, tell me why?

For, if your former words were true,
How useless would such sorrow be;
As wise, to mourn the seed which grew
Unnoticed on its parent tree,
Because it fell in fertile earth,
And sprang up to a glorious birth--
Struck deep its root, and lifted high
Its green boughs, in the breezy sky.

'But, I'll not fear, I will not weep
For those whose bodies rest in sleep,--
I know there is a blessed shore,
Opening its ports for me, and mine;
And, gazing Time's wide waters o'er,
I weary for that land divine,
Where we were born, where you and I
Shall meet our Dearest, when we die;
From suffering and corruption free,
Restored into the Deity.'

'Well hast thou spoken, sweet, trustful child!
And wiser than thy sire;
And worldly tempests, raging wild,
Shall strengthen thy desire--
Thy fervent hope, through storm and foam,
Through wind and ocean's roar,
To reach, at last, the eternal home,
The steadfast, changeless, shore!'
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme
In terms of form, "Faith and Despondency" by Emily Bronte is a poem consisting of four stanzas, each with a varying number of lines. The first stanza has seven lines, the second and third stanzas have eighteen lines each, and the final stanza has ten lines. The irregular line lengths give the poem a conversational and flowing quality, mirroring the intimate conversation between a father and his daughter. 

The meter of the poem is mostly iambic, with alternating stressed and unstressed syllables creating a natural and rhythmic flow. This meter is evident in lines such as "The winter wind is loud and wild" and "I often sat, for hours together." The rhyme scheme is also irregular, with some stanzas following an ABAB rhyme scheme, while others do not adhere to a specific pattern. This lack of strict rhyme scheme adds to the conversational and reflective tone of the poem.

### Themes and Imagery
One of the central themes of the poem is the juxtaposition between faith and despair. The father expresses his feelings of longing and despair for loved ones who have passed away, while the daughter offers a perspective of faith and hope in the afterlife. This contrast is highlighted through the imagery of the winter wind, the cozy sheltered hall, and the imagery of the sea and eternal shore. The winter wind symbolizes the harsh realities of life, while the cozy hall represents a safe haven where the characters can find solace and comfort.

The imagery of the sea and the eternal shore symbolize the passage from earthly life to the afterlife, emphasizing the daughter's unwavering faith in a divine existence beyond death. The contrast between the bleak winter landscape and the hopeful imagery of a blessed shore creates a sense of tension and complexity in the poem, exploring the themes of mortality, faith, and the afterlife.

### Literary Devices
Bronte employs several literary devices throughout the poem to enhance its themes and imagery. One notable device is personification, as seen in the lines "November's gusts unheeded call" and "The grave is drear, but they are not there." Personifying the wind and the grave adds depth to the poem, giving human-like qualities to these elements and emphasizing the emotional weight of the speaker's reflections.

Another literary device used is metaphor, as seen in the comparison of mourning to "mourning the seed which grew unnoticed on its parent tree." This metaphor illustrates the futility of grieving for those who have passed away, highlighting the inevitability of death and the natural cycle of life.

### Historical and Personal Context
Emily Bronte, best known for her novel "Wuthering Heights," often explored themes of love, loss, and mortality in her works. As a member of the Bronte literary family, Emily drew inspiration from her own experiences and surroundings, which likely influenced the emotional depth and introspective nature of her poetry.

"Faith and Despondency" reflects the Victorian era's preoccupation with mortality and the afterlife, as well as the Romantic emphasis on nature and spirituality. The poem captures the Victorian sensibility of grappling with existential questions and finding solace in faith and hope amidst the uncertainties of life.

### Deep Reading
Through the intimate dialogue between the father and daughter, "Faith and Despondency" delves into the universal themes of grief, faith, and the afterlife. The father's lamentations and the daughter's unwavering faith create a poignant contrast that invites readers to contemplate the nature of existence and the human experience of loss.

The poem ultimately serves as a meditation on the complexities of mortality and the enduring power of faith in the face of despair. By juxtaposing the father's despondency with the daughter's optimism, Bronte crafts a nuanced exploration of the human condition and the eternal search for meaning and transcendence. The shifting perspectives and imagery in the poem evoke a sense of emotional depth and contemplation, inviting readers to reflect on their own beliefs and perceptions of life and death.
