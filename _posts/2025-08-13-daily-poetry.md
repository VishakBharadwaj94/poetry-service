## Disabled by Wilfred Owen

```
He sat in a wheeled chair, waiting for dark,
And shivered in his ghastly suit of grey,
Legless, sewn short at elbow.  Through the park
Voices of boys rang saddening like a hymn,
Voices of play and pleasure after day,
Till gathering sleep had mothered them from him.

About this time Town used to swing so gay
When glow-lamps budded in the light-blue trees
And girls glanced lovelier as the air grew dim,
-- In the old times, before he threw away his knees.
Now he will never feel again how slim
Girls' waists are, or how warm their subtle hands,
All of them touch him like some queer disease.

There was an artist silly for his face,
For it was younger than his youth, last year.
Now he is old; his back will never brace;
He's lost his colour very far from here,
Poured it down shell-holes till the veins ran dry,
And half his lifetime lapsed in the hot race,
And leap of purple spurted from his thigh.
One time he liked a bloodsmear down his leg,
After the matches carried shoulder-high.
It was after football, when he'd drunk a peg,
He thought he'd better join.  He wonders why . . .
Someone had said he'd look a god in kilts.

That's why; and maybe, too, to please his Meg,
Aye, that was it, to please the giddy jilts,
He asked to join.  He didn't have to beg;
Smiling they wrote his lie; aged nineteen years.
Germans he scarcely thought of; and no fears
Of Fear came yet.  He thought of jewelled hilts
For daggers in plaid socks; of smart salutes;
And care of arms; and leave; and pay arrears;
Esprit de corps; and hints for young recruits.
And soon, he was drafted out with drums and cheers.

Some cheered him home, but not as crowds cheer Goal.
Only a solemn man who brought him fruits
Thanked him; and then inquired about his soul.
Now, he will spend a few sick years in Institutes,
And do what things the rules consider wise,
And take whatever pity they may dole.
To-night he noticed how the women's eyes
Passed from him to the strong men that were whole.
How cold and late it is!  Why don't they come
And put him into bed?  Why don't they come?
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

In terms of form, "Disabled" by Wilfred Owen is a lyric poem written in free verse. The lack of a consistent rhyme scheme and meter mirrors the fragmented and disjointed nature of the disabled soldier's thoughts and experiences. The poem is divided into seven stanzas, each with varying lengths, which also contributes to the sense of disorientation and unease felt by the protagonist.

The irregular structure of the poem reflects the chaotic and unsettling reality of war and its aftermath. The lack of a traditional form allows for a more raw and emotional expression of the soldier's inner turmoil and suffering. The absence of a strict rhyme scheme and meter gives the poem a sense of spontaneity and authenticity, enhancing its impact on the reader.

### Themes and Imagery

One of the central themes in "Disabled" is the devastating impact of war on individuals, particularly young soldiers who are left physically and emotionally scarred. The poem explores the loss of identity, dignity, and agency that comes with disability, as seen through the perspective of a young man who has been left legless and alone. The imagery in the poem is vivid and haunting, with descriptions of the soldier's physical pain and emotional isolation evoking a sense of profound loss and despair.

The contrast between the soldier's memories of his past life and his current reality highlights the stark difference between his former sense of vitality and the bleakness of his present existence. The vivid descriptions of the soldier's physical deterioration and the indifference of those around him serve to emphasize the cruelty and senselessness of war.

### Literary Devices

Owen employs a range of literary devices in "Disabled" to convey the emotional depth and complexity of the soldier's experience. One notable device is imagery, which is used to evoke powerful and poignant visual and sensory impressions. For example, the soldier's "ghastly suit of grey" and the image of his lost color "poured down shell-holes" create a vivid picture of his physical and emotional suffering.

Another important literary device in the poem is irony, as seen in the soldier's initial eagerness to join the war effort, thinking he would look like a "god in kilts," only to end up disabled and abandoned. The contrast between his youthful naivety and his current disillusionment underscores the tragic irony of war.

### Historical and Personal Context

Wilfred Owen himself served as a soldier in World War I and was deeply affected by the horrors he witnessed on the front lines. "Disabled" reflects Owen's own disillusionment with the war and his empathy for those who suffered as a result of it. The poem provides a stark portrayal of the physical and psychological toll of war on individuals, drawing on Owen's own experiences to convey the devastating consequences of conflict.

The historical context of World War I, with its unprecedented scale of destruction and loss of life, informs the themes and imagery of the poem. Owen's firsthand knowledge of the brutality of war lends authenticity and power to his depiction of the disabled soldier's plight.

### Deep Reading

"Disabled" is a searing indictment of the senselessness and cruelty of war, focusing on the personal tragedy of one young soldier who has been left broken and forgotten. The poem challenges conventional notions of heroism and patriotism, highlighting the harsh reality faced by those who sacrifice their youth and innocence in the name of duty.

Through the lens of the disabled soldier's experience, Owen exposes the dehumanizing effects of war and the way it strips individuals of their agency and identity. The poem forces the reader to confront the uncomfortable truths about the toll of conflict on the human spirit, leaving a lasting impact long after the final lines have been read.

Overall, "Disabled" is a poignant and powerful exploration of the devastating consequences of war, offering a compassionate and unflinching portrayal of its victims. Owen's evocative imagery, use of literary devices, and personal connection to the subject matter combine to create a deeply moving and thought-provoking work that continues to resonate with readers today.

## The Conqueror Worm by Edgar Allan Poe

```
Lo! 'tis a gala night
  Within the lonesome latter years!
An angel throng, bewinged, bedight
  In veils, and drowned in tears,
Sit in a theatre, to see
  A play of hopes and fears,
While the orchestra breathes fitfully
  The music of the spheres.

Mimes, in the form of God on high,
  Mutter and mumble low,
And hither and thither fly--
  Mere puppets they, who come and go
At bidding of vast formless things
  That shift the scenery to and fro,
Flapping from out their Condor wings
  Invisible Wo!

That motley drama--oh, be sure
  It shall not be forgot!
With its Phantom chased for evermore,
  By a crowd that seize it not,
Through a circle that ever returneth in
  To the self-same spot,
And much of Madness, and more of Sin,
  And Horror the soul of the plot.

But see, amid the mimic rout
  A crawling shape intrude!
A blood-red thing that writhes from out
  The scenic solitude!
It writhes!--it writhes!--with mortal pangs
  The mimes become its food,
And the angels sob at vermin fangs
  In human gore imbued.

Out--out are the lights--out all!
  And, over each quivering form,
The curtain, a funeral pall,
  Comes down with the rush of a storm,
And the angels, all pallid and wan,
  Uprising, unveiling, affirm
That the play is the tragedy, "Man,"
  And its hero the Conqueror Worm.
```

## In Memory of Rupert Brooke by Joyce Kilmer

```
In alien earth, across a troubled sea,
His body lies that was so fair and young.
His mouth is stopped, with half his songs unsung;
His arm is still, that struck to make men free.
But let no cloud of lamentation be
Where, on a warrior's grave, a lyre is hung.
We keep the echoes of his golden tongue,
We keep the vision of his chivalry.
So Israel's joy, the loveliest of kings,
Smote now his harp, and now the hostile horde.
To-day the starry roof of Heaven rings
With psalms a soldier made to praise his Lord;
And David rests beneath Eternal wings,
Song on his lips, and in his hand a sword.
```
