## I. Peace by Rupert Brooke

```
Now, God be thanked Who has matched us with His hour,
And caught our youth, and wakened us from sleeping,
With hand made sure, clear eye, and sharpened power,
To turn, as swimmers into cleanness leaping,
Glad from a world grown old and cold and weary,
Leave the sick hearts that honour could not move,
And half-men, and their dirty songs and dreary,
And all the little emptiness of love!

Oh! we, who have known shame, we have found release there,
Where there's no ill, no grief, but sleep has mending,
Naught broken save this body, lost but breath;
Nothing to shake the laughing heart's long peace there
But only agony, and that has ending;
And the worst friend and enemy is but Death.
```

## Confessions by Robert Browning

```
What is he buzzing in my ears?
  "Now that I come to die,
Do I view the world as a vale of tears?"
  Ah, reverend sir, not I!

What I viewed there once, what I view again
  Where the physic bottles stand
On the table's edge,--is a suburb lane,
  With a wall to my bedside hand.

That lane sloped, much as the bottles do,
  From a house you could descry
O'er the garden-wall: is the curtain blue
  Or green to a healthy eye?

To mine, it serves for the old June weather
  Blue above lane and wall;
And that farthest bottle labelled "Ether"
  Is the house o'er-topping all.

At a terrace, somewhere near the stopper,
  There watched for me, one June,
A girl: I know, sir, it's improper,
  My poor mind's out of tune.

Only, there was a way ... you crept
  Close by the side, to dodge
Eyes in the house, two eyes except:
  They styled their house "The Lodge."

What right had a lounger up their lane?
  But, by creeping very close,
With the good wall's help,--their eyes might strain
  And stretch themselves to Oes,

Yet never catch her and me together,
  As she left the attic, there,
By the rim of the bottle labelled "Ether,"
  And stole from stair to stair

And stood by the rose-wreathed gate. Alas,
  We loved, sir--used to meet;
How sad and bad and mad it was--
  But then, how it was sweet!
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme
In terms of form, "Confessions" by Robert Browning is a dramatic monologue, a form commonly used by Browning in which a speaker addresses an implied or specific audience. The poem consists of a single stanza with 24 lines. The structure is irregular, with varying line lengths which contribute to a conversational tone. 

In terms of meter, the poem does not adhere strictly to a specific metrical pattern. However, there are instances of iambic pentameter, such as in lines like "What I viewed there once, what I view again." 

The rhyme scheme is also irregular, with some lines rhyming (ears/tears, again/hand, do/blue, etc.) but not following a consistent pattern throughout the poem. This irregularity adds to the conversational and confessional feel of the poem.

### Themes and Imagery
One of the central themes of "Confessions" is memory and nostalgia. The speaker reflects on a past love affair, recalling the details of their secret meetings and the bittersweet emotions associated with it. The imagery in the poem is vivid and evocative, with the physical setting of the suburb lane and the bottles on the table serving as symbolic representations of the speaker's memories. The blue curtain and the bottle labeled "Ether" become significant symbols of the past relationship and the emotions attached to it.

The poem also explores themes of secrecy, forbidden love, and the passage of time. The speaker's reminiscences of the girl he used to meet in secret highlight the complexities of human relationships and the inevitable pain that comes with lost love.

### Literary Devices
Browning employs several literary devices in "Confessions" to enhance the poem's emotional impact. One such device is imagery, which is used to create a vivid picture of the speaker's memories. The descriptions of the lane, the wall, and the bottles on the table all contribute to the atmosphere of nostalgia and longing.

The poem also features irony, as the speaker acknowledges the impropriety of his past actions while simultaneously reveling in the sweetness of the memories. The juxtaposition of sadness and joy in the speaker's recollections adds depth to the emotional complexity of the poem.

Additionally, Browning uses symbolism, as seen in the blue curtain and the bottle labeled "Ether," to represent the past relationship and the speaker's feelings associated with it. These symbols serve to deepen the reader's understanding of the speaker's inner turmoil.

### Historical and Personal Context
Robert Browning was a Victorian poet known for his dramatic monologues and exploration of complex human emotions. "Confessions" was published in 1845 as part of Browning's collection titled "Dramatic Lyrics." The poem reflects the romantic sensibilities of the Victorian era, as well as Browning's interest in exploring the inner workings of the human mind.

In a personal context, Browning's own marriage to fellow poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning was famously passionate and unconventional, which may have influenced his exploration of themes such as love, secrecy, and longing in his poetry.

### Deep Reading
"Confessions" can be read as a meditation on the nature of memory and the ways in which we construct and reconstruct our past experiences. The speaker's reflections on his past love affair reveal the complexity of human emotions and the enduring power of nostalgia.

The poem also raises questions about the nature of love and the ways in which forbidden or unconventional relationships can shape our identities. The speaker's admission of the "sad and bad and mad" aspects of his past love affair suggests a recognition of the moral ambiguity of human relationships.

Overall, "Confessions" invites readers to consider the ways in which our past experiences continue to influence our present selves and the ways in which we navigate the complexities of love, loss, and memory. Browning's skillful use of language and imagery creates a poignant and evocative portrait of a love affair that lingers in the speaker's mind long after it has ended.

## Hymn To Aristogeiton And Harmodius by Edgar Allan Poe

```
Wreathed in myrtle, my sword I'll conceal,
  Like those champions devoted and brave,
When they plunged in the tyrant their steel,
  And to Athens deliverance gave.

Beloved heroes! your deathless souls roam
  In the joy breathing isles of the blest;
Where the mighty of old have their home--
  Where Achilles and Diomed rest.

In fresh myrtle my blade I'll entwine,
  Like Harmodius, the gallant and good,
When he made at the tutelar shrine
  A libation of Tyranny's blood.

Ye deliverers of Athens from shame!
  Ye avengers of Liberty's wrongs!
Endless ages shall cherish your fame,
  Embalmed in their echoing songs!
```

This rhythmic pattern creates a sense of momentum and urgency in the poem, reflecting the heroic and revolutionary themes it explores.

### Themes and Imagery

The central themes of the poem revolve around heroism, sacrifice, and the fight for freedom. The imagery of myrtle, a symbol of love and immortality, is used to evoke the bravery and devotion of the champions Aristogeiton and Harmodius.

### Literary Devices

Poe employs several literary devices in the poem to enhance its emotional impact and thematic depth.

The repetition of "Ye deliverers of Athens" and "Ye avengers of Liberty's wrongs" creates a sense of reverence and adulation for the heroic figures being celebrated.

### Historical and Personal Context

By aligning himself with these legendary figures, Poe expresses his admiration for those who are willing to make personal sacrifices for the greater good and stand up against tyranny. This theme of resistance against oppression resonates with Poe's own struggles and beliefs as a writer who often challenged societal norms and conventions.
