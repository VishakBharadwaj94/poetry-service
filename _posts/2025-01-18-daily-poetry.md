## Besides the Autumn poets sing by Emily Dickinson

```
Besides the Autumn poets sing
A few prosaic days
A little this side of the snow
And that side of the Haze --

A few incisive Mornings --
A few Ascetic Eves --
Gone -- Mr. Bryant's "Golden Rod" --
And Mr. Thomson's "sheaves."

Still, is the bustle in the Brook --
Sealed are the spicy valves --
Mesmeric fingers softly touch
The Eyes of many Elves --

Perhaps a squirrel may remain --
My sentiments to share --
Grant me, Oh Lord, a sunny mind --
Thy windy will to bear!
```

## From Sunset to Star Rise by Christina Rossetti

```
Go from me, summer friends, and tarry not:
I am no summer friend, but wintry cold,
A silly sheep benighted from the fold,
A sluggard with a thorn-choked garden plot.
Take counsel, sever from my lot your lot,
Dwell in your pleasant places, hoard your gold;
Lest you with me should shiver on the wold,
Athirst and hungering on a barren spot.
For I have hedged me with a thorny hedge,
I live alone, I look to die alone:
Yet sometimes, when a wind sighs through the sedge,
Ghosts of my buried years, and friends come back,
My heart goes sighing after swallows flown
On sometime summer's unreturning track.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

This poem is a Petrarchan sonnet, structured with an octave (first eight lines) followed by a sestet (final six lines). The rhyme scheme of the octave is ABBAABBA, while the sestet follows a more flexible pattern of CDCDCD. The meter is predominantly iambic pentameter, with lines containing ten syllables each and a stress pattern of unstressed followed by stressed syllables.

### Themes and Imagery

The overarching theme of the poem is loneliness and isolation. The speaker expresses a sense of alienation from others, referring to themselves as "wintry cold" and likening their situation to being a "silly sheep benighted from the fold." This imagery of being alone and abandoned is reinforced by the description of a "thorn-choked garden plot" and a "barren spot." The imagery of the thorny hedge symbolizes the speaker's emotional barriers and their unwillingness to let others in, leading to their solitary existence.

### Literary Devices

Rossetti employs various literary devices to enhance the poem's meaning. The use of personification is evident in lines like "when a wind sighs through the sedge," giving the wind human-like qualities. There is also a metaphorical comparison in the line "Ghosts of my buried years, and friends come back," where the past is likened to ghosts haunting the speaker. Additionally, the repetition of the word "alone" emphasizes the speaker's isolation and reinforces the central theme of loneliness.

### Historical and Personal Context

Christina Rossetti was known for her introspective and melancholic poetry, often exploring themes of love, death, and spirituality. As a devout Christian, her work often reflects her struggles with faith and her deep sense of isolation. Rossetti's personal experiences, including unrequited love and battles with depression, likely influenced her poignant and introspective writing style.

### Deep Reading

The speaker's lamentation of being left alone and their reluctance to let others in reflects a deep sense of emotional pain and longing for connection. The imagery of the "thorny hedge" symbolizes the protective barriers the speaker has erected around themselves, stemming from past hurts or betrayals. The final lines, where the speaker reminisces about past summers and lost friendships, evoke a sense of nostalgia and longing for happier times. Despite their self-imposed isolation, the speaker still yearns for the warmth and companionship of those they have lost. This internal conflict between the desire for connection and the fear of vulnerability adds layers of complexity to the poem's exploration of loneliness and emotional isolation.
