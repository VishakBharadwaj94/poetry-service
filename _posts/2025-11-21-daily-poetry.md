## Pain -- has an Element of Blank -- by Emily Dickinson

```
Pain -- has an Element of Blank --
It cannot recollect
When it begun -- or if there were
A time when it was not --

It has no Future -- but itself --
Its Infinite contain
Its Past -- enlightened to perceive
New Periods -- of Pain.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme
Emily Dickinson's poem "Pain -- has an Element of Blank --" consists of four quatrains, each with a consistent alternating rhyme scheme (ABCB). The poem is written in iambic tetrameter, with lines alternating between four and three stresses. This regular structure gives the poem a sense of order and control, which contrasts with the chaotic and uncontrollable nature of pain that is being described.

### Themes and Imagery
The central theme of the poem is the enigmatic nature of pain. Dickinson personifies pain as having an "Element of Blank," suggesting that it is a void or emptiness that defies explanation. The speaker muses on the timeless and infinite quality of pain, highlighting its ability to consume the past and present. The imagery of pain as a blank, formless entity conveys a sense of emptiness and despair.

### Literary Devices
Dickinson employs several literary devices to convey the theme of pain in the poem. The use of personification in describing pain as having an "Element of Blank" gives it a human-like quality, making it more relatable to the reader. The repetition of the word "Pain" throughout the poem emphasizes its all-encompassing nature. Additionally, the use of paradox in lines such as "It has no Future -- but itself" underscores the cyclical and eternal quality of pain.

### Historical and Personal Context
Emily Dickinson was known for her introspective and often morbid poetry, reflecting her own struggles with mental health and isolation. The theme of pain in this poem may be a reflection of Dickinson's own experiences with suffering and emotional turmoil. Additionally, the poem was written during the mid-19th century, a time when discussions of mental health and emotional well-being were not as open or accepted as they are today.

### Deep Reading
The poem delves into the existential nature of pain, presenting it as a universal and timeless experience that transcends individual circumstances. The concept of pain as an "Element of Blank" suggests that it is a void or absence that defies rational understanding. The idea that pain has no beginning or end, no future or past, underscores its pervasive and unrelenting nature. By framing pain in this way, Dickinson captures the ineffable and indescribable essence of suffering, inviting readers to contemplate the profound and mysterious aspects of human experience.

## The Young Soldier by Wilfred Owen

```
It is not death
Without hereafter
To one in dearth
Of life and its laughter,

Nor the sweet murder
Dealt slow and even
Unto the martyr
Smiling at heaven:

It is the smile
Faint as a (waning) myth,
Faint, and exceeding small
On a boy's murdered mouth.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "The Young Soldier" by Wilfred Owen is structured as a four-stanza poem with irregular line lengths, giving it a free verse form. The lack of a consistent meter or rhyme scheme contributes to the poem's conversational and contemplative tone. The use of enjambment, where sentences and thoughts flow into the next line without punctuation, creates a sense of fluidity and continuity in the poem.

### Themes and Imagery

The central themes of the poem revolve around death, sacrifice, and the loss of innocence in war. The imagery used by Owen is vivid and poignant, evoking powerful emotions in the reader. The contrast between the "sweet murder" and the "boy's murdered mouth" highlights the brutality and senseless violence of war. The image of the faint smile on the soldier's face emphasizes the tragic loss of youth and potential, as well as the devastating impact of war on the individual.

### Literary Devices

Owen employs various literary devices to convey the themes and emotions in the poem. The use of contrast between life and death, laughter and murder, martyrdom and heaven, creates a sense of irony and ambiguity. The repetition of the word "faint" emphasizes the insignificance and fleeting nature of the smile on the soldier's face. The comparison of the smile to a "waning myth" suggests that even in death, there is a sense of disillusionment and loss of ideals.

### Historical and Personal Context

Wilfred Owen was a soldier in World War I and his poems often reflect the horrors and realities of war. "The Young Soldier" captures the devastating impact of war on young soldiers, particularly their loss of innocence and the senseless violence they are subjected to. Owen's own experiences in the war influenced his writing, as he witnessed firsthand the suffering and sacrifice of his fellow soldiers.

### Deep Reading

The poem "The Young Soldier" serves as a poignant reflection on the futility and tragedy of war. The smile on the young soldier's face symbolizes the resilience and bravery of those who face death with courage, despite the overwhelming odds stacked against them. The juxtaposition of the smile with the imagery of murder and martyrdom highlights the complexity of human emotions in the face of death. Ultimately, Owen's poem challenges the romanticized notions of war and emphasizes the harsh realities faced by those who are caught in its destructive path.

## Time's Revenges by Robert Browning

```
I've a Friend, over the sea;
I like him, but he loves me.
It all grew out of the books I write;
They find such favour in his sight
That he slaughters you with savage looks
Because you don't admire my books.
He does himself though,--and if some vein
Were to snap tonight in this heavy brain,
To-morrow month, if I lived to try,
Round should I just turn quietly,
Or out of the bedclothes stretch my hand
Till I found him, come from his foreign land
To be my nurse in this poor place,
And make my broth and wash my face
And light my fire and, all the while,
Bear with his old good-humoured smile
That I told him "Better have kept away
Than come and kill me, night and day,
With, worse than fever throbs and shoots,
The creaking of his clumsy boots."
I am as sure that this he would do,
As that Saint Paul's is striking two.
And I think I rather... woe is me!
--Yes, rather would see him than not see,
If lifting a hand could seat him there
Before me in the empty chair
To-night, when my head aches indeed,
And I can neither think nor read
Nor make these purple fingers hold
The pen; this garret's freezing cold!

And I've a Lady--there he wakes,
The laughing fiend and prince of snakes
Within me, at her name, to pray
Fate send some creature in the way
Of my love for her, to be down-torn,
Upthrust and outward-borne,
So I might prove myself that sea
Of passion which I needs must be!
Call my thoughts false and my fancies quaint
And my style infirm and its figures faint,
All the critics say, and more blame yet,
And not one angry word you get.
But, please you, wonder I would put
My cheek beneath that lady's foot
Rather than trample under mine
That laurels of the Florentine,
And you shall see how the devil spends
A fire God gave for other ends!
I tell you, I stride up and down
This garret, crowned with love's best crown,
And feasted with love's perfect feast,
To think I kill for her, at least,
Body and soul and peace and fame,
Alike youth's end and manhood's aim,
--So is my spirit, as flesh with sin,
Filled full, eaten out and in
With the face of her, the eyes of her,
The lips, the little chin, the stir
Of shadow round her mouth; and she
--I'll tell you,--calmly would decree
That I should roast at a slow fire,

If that would compass her desire
And make her one whom they invite
To the famous ball to-morrow night.

There may be heaven; there must be hell;
Meantime, there is our earth here--well!
```
