## Ulalume by Edgar Allan Poe

```
The skies they were ashen and sober;
  The leaves they were crisped and sere--
  The leaves they were withering and sere;
It was night in the lonesome October
  Of my most immemorial year;
It was hard by the dim lake of Auber,
  In the misty mid region of Weir--
It was down by the dank tarn of Auber,
  In the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.

Here once, through an alley Titanic.
  Of cypress, I roamed with my Soul--
  Of cypress, with Psyche, my Soul.
These were days when my heart was volcanic
  As the scoriac rivers that roll--
  As the lavas that restlessly roll
Their sulphurous currents down Yaanek
  In the ultimate climes of the pole--
That groan as they roll down Mount Yaanek
  In the realms of the boreal pole.

Our talk had been serious and sober,
  But our thoughts they were palsied and sere--
  Our memories were treacherous and sere--
For we knew not the month was October,
And we marked not the night of the year--
  (Ah, night of all nights in the year!)
We noted not the dim lake of Auber--
  (Though once we had journeyed down here)--
Remembered not the dank tarn of Auber,
  Nor the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.

And now as the night was senescent
  And star-dials pointed to morn--
  As the sun-dials hinted of morn--
At the end of our path a liquescent
  And nebulous lustre was born,
Out of which a miraculous crescent
  Arose with a duplicate horn--
Astarte's bediamonded crescent
  Distinct with its duplicate horn.

And I said--"She is warmer than Dian:
  She rolls through an ether of sighs--
  She revels in a region of sighs:
She has seen that the tears are not dry on
  These cheeks, where the worm never dies,
And has come past the stars of the Lion
  To point us the path to the skies--
  To the Lethean peace of the skies--
Come up, in despite of the Lion,
  To shine on us with her bright eyes--
Come up through the lair of the Lion,
  With love in her luminous eyes."

But Psyche, uplifting her finger,
  Said--"Sadly this star I mistrust--
  Her pallor I strangely mistrust:--
Oh, hasten!--oh, let us not linger!
  Oh, fly!--let us fly!--for we must."
In terror she spoke, letting sink her
  Wings till they trailed in the dust--
In agony sobbed, letting sink her
  Plumes till they trailed in the dust--
  Till they sorrowfully trailed in the dust.

I replied--"This is nothing but dreaming:
  Let us on by this tremulous light!
  Let us bathe in this crystalline light!
Its Sibyllic splendor is beaming
  With Hope and in Beauty to-night:--
  See!--it flickers up the sky through the night!
Ah, we safely may trust to its gleaming,
  And be sure it will lead us aright--
We safely may trust to a gleaming
  That cannot but guide us aright,
  Since it flickers up to Heaven through the night."

Thus I pacified Psyche and kissed her,
  And tempted her out of her gloom--
  And conquered her scruples and gloom;
And we passed to the end of a vista,
  But were stopped by the door of a tomb--
  By the door of a legended tomb;
And I said--"What is written, sweet sister,
  On the door of this legended tomb?"
  She replied--"Ulalume--Ulalume--
  'Tis the vault of thy lost Ulalume!"

Then my heart it grew ashen and sober
  As the leaves that were crisped and sere--
  As the leaves that were withering and sere;
And I cried--"It was surely October
  On _this_ very night of last year
  That I journeyed--I journeyed down here--
  That I brought a dread burden down here!
  On this night of all nights in the year,
  Ah, what demon has tempted me here?
Well I know, now, this dim lake of Auber--
  This misty mid region of Weir--
Well I know, now, this dank tarn of Auber,--
  This ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir."
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

In "Ulalume," Edgar Allan Poe utilizes a unique form and structure to convey the eerie and mysterious atmosphere of the poem. The poem consists of eleven stanzas, each with a varying number of lines. The irregularity in stanza length contributes to the sense of unease and instability present throughout the poem. Additionally, the poem follows a rhyme scheme of ABABCBCA, with the rhyming couplets creating a musical and flowing effect that contrasts with the dark subject matter.

Poe also employs a meter that is predominantly iambic tetrameter, with lines containing four metrical feet. This meter creates a steady rhythm that enhances the lyrical quality of the poem. However, Poe strategically disrupts this meter at times, such as in the lines "Ah, night of all nights in the year!" and "She has seen that the tears are not dry on," adding emphasis and drawing attention to key moments in the narrative.

### Themes and Imagery

The themes of death, loss, and the passage of time are prominent in "Ulalume." The poem explores the speaker's grief over the loss of Ulalume, a beloved figure from his past. The imagery of the desolate landscape in October, with ashen skies, withering leaves, and misty lakes, creates a haunting backdrop for the speaker's emotional turmoil. The use of natural imagery, such as cypress trees and a dim lake, contributes to the eerie and melancholic tone of the poem.

The celestial imagery of stars and moons symbolizes hope and guidance in the face of darkness and despair. The crescent moon, described as "Astarte's bediamonded crescent," represents a beacon of light leading the way through the speaker's emotional turmoil. However, this celestial imagery is juxtaposed with dark and foreboding elements, such as ghouls and tombs, underscoring the pervasive sense of loss and unease that permeates the poem.

### Literary Devices

Poe employs a variety of literary devices in "Ulalume" to enhance the poem's mood and meaning. Alliteration, assonance, and consonance are used throughout the poem to create a sense of musicality and rhythm. For example, in the lines "Ah, night of all nights in the year!" and "She has seen that the tears are not dry on," the repeated sounds help to emphasize the speaker's emotional state.

Repetition is another key literary device in the poem, particularly with the repeated references to the dim lake of Auber and the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir. This repetition serves to underscore the speaker's sense of disorientation and confusion as he navigates through the eerie landscape. Additionally, the use of personification, such as the personified stars and moons, adds a mystical and otherworldly quality to the poem.

### Historical and Personal Context

"Ulalume" was written by Edgar Allan Poe in 1847, during a period marked by personal tragedy and loss in the author's life. Poe's wife, Virginia Clemm, had been suffering from tuberculosis, and her deteriorating health weighed heavily on Poe during this time. The themes of death, grief, and longing in "Ulalume" reflect Poe's own experiences with loss and the haunting specter of mortality.

The poem also reflects the broader cultural context of the Romantic era, with its emphasis on emotion, nature, and the supernatural. Poe's exploration of the macabre and the mysterious aligns with the Gothic literary tradition of the time, which sought to evoke feelings of terror and awe in readers. The dark and atmospheric imagery in "Ulalume" resonated with the Romantic fascination with the sublime and the unknown.

### Deep Reading

"Ulalume" delves into the complexities of grief and memory, as the speaker grapples with the haunting presence of Ulalume and the pain of loss. The poem's shifting landscapes, from the desolate October night to the celestial realm of stars and moons, mirror the speaker's internal turmoil and his search for solace. The repeated references to the dim lake of Auber and the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir serve as metaphors for the speaker's haunted psyche and his inability to escape the past.

The encounter with the legended tomb at the end of the poem symbolizes the speaker's confrontation with his own mortality and the inevitability of death. The revelation that the tomb belongs to Ulalume underscores the inescapable nature of loss and the lasting impact of grief on the human soul. Ultimately, "Ulalume" is a meditation on the fragility of life, the persistence of memory, and the eternal yearning for that which has been lost.

## On A Portrait Of Wordsworth by Elizabeth Barrett Browning

```
WORDSWORTH upon Helvellyn ! Let the cloud
Ebb audibly along the mountain-wind,
Then break against the rock, and show behind
The lowland valleys floating up to crowd
The sense with beauty. He with forehead bowed
And humble-lidded eyes, as one inclined
Before the sovran thought of his own mind,
And very meek with inspirations proud,
Takes here his rightful place as poet-priest
By the high altar, singing prayer and prayer

To the higher Heavens. A noble vision free
Our Haydon's hand has flung out from the mist:
No portrait this, with Academic air !
This is the poet and his poetry.
```

## Fragment: 'Unrisen Splendour of the Brightest Sun' by Percy Bysshe Shelley

Unrisen splendour of the brightest sun,
To rise upon our darkness, if the star
Now beckoning thee out of thy misty throne
Could thaw the clouds which wage an obscure war
With thy young brightness!
```
