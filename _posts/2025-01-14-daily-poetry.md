## Winter Song by Wilfred Owen

```
The browns, the olives, and the yellows died,
And were swept up to heaven; where they glowed
Each dawn and set of sun till Christmastide,
And when the land lay pale for them, pale-snowed,
Fell back, and down the snow-drifts flamed and flowed.

From off your face, into the winds of winter,
The sun-brown and the summer-gold are blowing;
But they shall gleam with spiritual glinter,
When paler beauty on your brows falls snowing,
And through those snows my looks shall be soft-going.
```

## I cried at Pity -- not at Pain -- by Emily Dickinson

```
I cried at Pity -- not at Pain --
I heard a Woman say
"Poor Child" -- and something in her voice
Convicted me -- of me --

So long I fainted, to myself
It seemed the common way,
And Health, and Laughter, Curious things --
To look at, like a Toy --

To sometimes hear "Rich people" buy
And see the Parcel rolled --
And carried, I supposed -- to Heaven,
For children, made of Gold --

But not to touch, or wish for,
Or think of, with a sigh --
And so and so -- had been to me,
Had God willed differently.

I wish I knew that Woman's name --
So when she comes this way,
To hold my life, and hold my ears
For fear I hear her say

She's "sorry I am dead" -- again --
Just when the Grave and I --
Have sobbed ourselves almost to sleep,
Our only Lullaby --
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme
This poem by Emily Dickinson consists of four quatrains with an ABCB rhyme scheme, following a consistent meter of iambic tetrameter. The use of regular rhyme and meter gives the poem a sing-song quality, almost like a nursery rhyme, which contrasts with the depth of the emotions expressed within the poem.

### Themes and Imagery
The central theme of the poem revolves around the speaker's realization of her own lack of empathy and compassion. The speaker confesses that she cried not out of pity, but rather at the realization that she lacked the ability to feel true compassion. The imagery used in the poem, such as the reference to "Rich people" buying parcels for heaven and children made of gold, serves to highlight the speaker's detachment and materialistic view of the world.

### Literary Devices
One of the key literary devices used in the poem is irony. The speaker initially cries at the lack of pity rather than the pain itself, showcasing a paradoxical situation where the speaker's emotions are not aligned with societal expectations. Dickinson also employs personification in lines such as "To hold my life, and hold my ears," giving human-like qualities to abstract concepts like life and hearing.

### Historical and Personal Context
Emily Dickinson, known for her introspective and often melancholic poetry, likely drew inspiration from her own experiences and observations of human behavior. The theme of empathy and compassion is a recurring motif in Dickinson's work, reflecting her own struggles with isolation and emotional depth. The societal norms and expectations of the time period, particularly concerning class distinctions and attitudes towards wealth, may have also influenced the speaker's perspective in the poem.

### Deep Reading
The poem delves into the complexities of human emotion and the nature of empathy. The speaker's confession of not crying out of pity but rather at the lack of it reveals a deep-seated emotional conflict within herself. The reference to "Rich people" buying parcels for heaven and children made of gold highlights the speaker's materialistic and detached view of compassion, suggesting a shallow understanding of true human connection. Ultimately, the poem serves as a poignant reflection on the importance of genuine empathy and the consequences of lacking it in one's interactions with others.

## Common Things by Paul Laurence Dunbar

```
I like to hear of wealth and gold,
And El Doradoes in their glory;
I like for silks and satins bold
To sweep and rustle through a story.

The nightingale is sweet of song;
The rare exotic smells divinely;
And knightly men who stride along,
The role heroic carry finely.

But then, upon the other hand,
Our minds have got a way of running
To things that aren't quite so grand,
Which, maybe, we are best in shunning.

For some of us still like to see
The poor man in his dwelling narrow,
The hollyhock, the bumblebee,
The meadow lark, and chirping sparrow.

We like the man who soars and sings
With high and lofty inspiration;
But he who sings of common things
Shall always share our admiration.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "Common Things" by Paul Laurence Dunbar consists of three stanzas, each containing eight lines with an ABAB rhyme scheme. The poem is written in iambic tetrameter, with lines alternating between eight and seven syllables. This consistent structure creates a rhythmic flow that enhances the poem's readability and emphasizes the contrast between the grand and common things the speaker discusses.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem is the contrast between the allure of grandeur and the beauty found in simplicity. The speaker initially expresses a fondness for luxurious and extravagant things, such as wealth, exotic scents, and heroic figures. However, as the poem progresses, the speaker acknowledges the value of common, everyday experiences and individuals, such as the poor man in his humble abode, the hollyhock, bumblebee, meadow lark, and chirping sparrow. This juxtaposition highlights the idea that while grandeur may be captivating, it is often the ordinary and overlooked aspects of life that hold true beauty and significance.

The imagery in the poem is vivid and evocative, appealing to the senses and painting a picture of both opulence and simplicity. References to wealth, silk, and satin create a visual image of luxury, while descriptions of the hollyhock, bumblebee, and chirping sparrow evoke a sense of natural beauty and tranquility. The contrast in imagery serves to emphasize the theme of finding value in common things amidst a world obsessed with extravagance.

### Literary Devices

Dunbar employs several literary devices in "Common Things" to enhance the poem's meaning and impact. One notable device is juxtaposition, as seen in the contrasting descriptions of grand and common elements throughout the poem. This contrast serves to highlight the speaker's shifting perspective on what is truly admirable and valuable in life.

Another device used is imagery, particularly in the vivid descriptions of both luxurious and ordinary objects and experiences. The rich sensory details bring the scenes to life and allow readers to visualize the different aspects of grandeur and simplicity being portrayed.

Additionally, the poem features alliteration in phrases like "silks and satins bold" and "meadow lark, and chirping sparrow," which adds a musical quality to the verses and helps to create a sense of unity within each stanza.

### Historical and Personal Context

Paul Laurence Dunbar, an African American poet, was known for his use of dialect and his exploration of themes related to race, identity, and social issues. While "Common Things" does not explicitly address these themes, Dunbar's personal background likely influenced his perspective on the value of simplicity and common experiences. As a writer who often depicted the lives of ordinary people, Dunbar may have sought to challenge societal norms that prioritize grandeur and wealth over the everyday joys and struggles of individuals from all walks of life.

### Deep Reading

On a deeper level, "Common Things" can be seen as a reflection on the human tendency to be drawn to the extraordinary while overlooking the beauty and significance of the ordinary. The speaker's journey from admiring wealth and luxury to appreciating the simplicity of nature and everyday life suggests a shift in perspective towards a more genuine and grounded sense of admiration. By valuing the man who sings of common things, the poem ultimately celebrates the power of authenticity and humility in art and in life. In a world filled with grandeur and spectacle, Dunbar's poem reminds us of the enduring value found in the common, the overlooked, and the everyday.
