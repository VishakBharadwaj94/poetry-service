## The New School by Joyce Kilmer

```
(For My Mother)

The halls that were loud with the merry tread of
young and careless feet
Are still with a stillness that is too drear to seem like holiday,
And never a gust of laughter breaks the calm of the dreaming street
Or rises to shake the ivied walls and frighten the doves away.
The dust is on book and on empty desk, and the
tennis-racquet and balls
Lie still in their lonely locker and wait for a game that is never
played,
And over the study and lecture-room and the river and meadow falls
A stern peace, a strange peace, a peace that War has made.
For many a youthful shoulder now is gay with an
epaulet,
And the hand that was deft with a cricket-bat is defter with a sword,
And some of the lads will laugh to-day where the trench is red and
wet,
And some will win on the bloody field the accolade of the Lord.
They have taken their youth and mirth away
from the study and playing-ground
To a new school in an alien land beneath an alien sky;
Out in the smoke and roar of the fight their lessons and games are
found,
And they who were learning how to live are learning how to die.
And after the golden day has come and the war is
at an end,
A slab of bronze on the chapel wall will tell of the noble dead.
And every name on that radiant list will be the name of a friend,
A name that shall through the centuries in grateful prayers be said.
And there will be ghosts in the old school,
brave ghosts with laughing eyes,
On the field with a ghostly cricket-bat, by the stream with a ghostly
rod;
They will touch the hearts of the living with a flame that sanctifies,
A flame that they took with strong young hands
from the altar-fires of God.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

Joyce Kilmer's poem "The New School" is written in free verse, with no consistent rhyme scheme or meter. The lack of rhyme and meter contributes to the somber and reflective tone of the poem, allowing the focus to remain on the content and emotions being conveyed. The poem is divided into four stanzas of varying lengths, each exploring different aspects of the impact of war on a school community.

### Themes and Imagery

The central themes in "The New School" revolve around the effects of war on youth and education. Kilmer contrasts the lively, carefree atmosphere of a school at peace with the solemn stillness that descends when war disrupts normalcy. The imagery of empty halls, dusty desks, and abandoned sports equipment conveys a sense of loss and absence. The poem also touches on themes of sacrifice, remembrance, and the passage of time.

### Literary Devices

Kilmer employs several literary devices to enhance the emotional impact of the poem. One such device is personification, as seen in the lines "And never a gust of laughter breaks the calm of the dreaming street" where laughter is given human qualities. The use of imagery, such as "a stern peace, a strange peace, a peace that War has made," creates a vivid picture of the aftermath of war. Additionally, the repetition of the word "ghosts" in the final stanza adds a haunting quality to the poem.

### Historical and Personal Context

Written during World War I, "The New School" reflects the widespread impact of the conflict on individuals and communities. Kilmer himself served in the war and tragically lost his life in battle. This personal connection adds depth to the poem, as Kilmer likely drew on his own experiences and observations of war's toll on young men. The poem serves as a tribute to those who sacrificed their youth and lives in service to their country.

### Deep Reading

Through "The New School," Kilmer delves into the profound changes brought about by war, particularly on the youth who are forced to grow up too quickly. The contrast between the innocence of youth and the harsh realities of war is starkly portrayed, as seen in the lines "And they who were learning how to live are learning how to die." The poem also explores the idea of memory and legacy, with the ghosts of the fallen serving as a reminder of the sacrifices made in the name of duty and honor. Overall, "The New School" is a poignant meditation on the price of war and the enduring impact it leaves on individuals and communities.

## Waring by Robert Browning

```
What's become of Waring
Since he gave us all the slip,
Chose land-travel or seafaring,
Boots and chest or staff and scrip,
Rather than pace up and down
Any longer London town?

Who'd have guessed it from his lip
Or his brow's accustomed bearing,
On the night he thus took ship
Or started landward?--little caring
For us, it seems, who supped together
(Friends of his too, I remember)
And walked home thro' the merry weather,
The snowiest in all December.
I left his arm that night myself
For what's-his-name's, the new prose-poet
Who wrote the book there, on the shelf--
How, forsooth, was I to know it
If Waring meant to glide away
Like a ghost at break of day?
Never looked he half so gay!

He was prouder than the devil:
How he must have cursed our revel!
Ay and many other meetings,
Indoor visits, outdoor greetings,
As up and down he paced this London,
With no work done, but great works undone,
Where scarce twenty knew his name.
Why not, then, have earlier spoken,
Written, bustled? Who's to blame
If your silence kept unbroken?
"True, but there were sundry jottings,
Stray-leaves, fragments, blurs and blottings,
Certain first steps were achieved
Already which (is that your meaning?)
Had well borne out whoe'er believed
In more to come!"  But who goes gleaning
Hedgeside chance-glades, while full-sheaved
Stand cornfields by him?  Pride, o'erweening
Pride alone, puts forth such claims
O'er the day's distinguished names.

Meantime, how much I loved him,
I find out now I've lost him.
I who cared not if I moved him,
Who could so carelessly accost him,
Henceforth never shall get free
Of his ghostly company,
His eyes that just a little wink
As deep I go into the merit
Of this and that distinguished spirit--
His cheeks' raised colour, soon to sink,
As long I dwell on some stupendous
And tremendous (Heaven defend us!)
Monstr'-inform'-ingens-horrend-ous
Demoniaco-seraphic
Penman's latest piece of graphic.
Nay, my very wrist grows warm
With his dragging weight of arm.
E'en so, swimmingly appears,
Through one's after-supper musings,
Some lost lady of old years
With her beauteous vain endeavour
And goodness unrepaid as ever;
The face, accustomed to refusings,
We, puppies that we were... Oh never
Surely, nice of conscience, scrupled
Being aught like false, forsooth, to?
Telling aught but honest truth to?
What a sin, had we centupled
Its possessor's grace and sweetness!
No! she heard in its completeness
Truth, for truth's a weighty matter,
And truth, at issue, we can't flatter!
Well, 'tis done with; she's exempt
From damning us thro' such a sally;
And so she glides, as down a valley,
Taking up with her contempt,
Past our reach; and in, the flowers
Shut her unregarded hours.

Oh, could I have him back once more,
This Waring, but one half-day more!
Back, with the quiet face of yore,
So hungry for acknowledgment
Like mine! I'd fool him to his bent.
Feed, should not he, to heart's content?
I'd say, "to only have conceived,
Planned your great works, apart from progress,
Surpasses little works achieved!"
I'd lie so, I should be believed.
I'd make such havoc of the claims
Of the day's distinguished names
To feast him with, as feasts an ogress
Her feverish sharp-toothed gold-crowned child!
Or as one feasts a creature rarely
Captured here, unreconciled
To capture; and completely gives
Its pettish humours license, barely
Requiring that it lives.

Ichabod, Ichabod,
The glory is departed!
Travels Waring East away?
Who, of knowledge, by hearsay,
Reports a man upstarted
Somewhere as a god,
Hordes grown European-hearted,
Millions of the wild made tame
On a sudden at his fame?
In Vishnu-land what Avatar?
Or who in Moscow, toward the Czar,
With the demurest of footfalls
Over the Kremlin's pavement bright
With serpentine and syenite,
Steps, with five other Generals
That simultaneously take snuff,
For each to have pretext enough
And kerchiefwise unfold his sash
Which, softness' self, is yet the stuff
To hold fast where a steel chain snaps,
And leave the grand white neck no gash?
Waring in Moscow, to those rough
Cold northern natures born perhaps,
Like the lamb-white maiden dear
From the circle of mute kings
Unable to repress the tear,
Each as his sceptre down he flings,
To Dian's fane at Taurica,
Where now a captive priestess, she alway
Mingles her tender grave Hellenic speech
With theirs, tuned to the hailstone-beaten beach
As pours some pigeon, from the myrrhy lands
Rapt by the whirlblast to fierce Scythian strands
Where breed the swallows, her melodious cry
Amid their barbarous twitter!
In Russia?  Never!  Spain were fitter!
Ay, most likely 'tis in Spain
That we and Waring meet again
Now, while he turns down that cool narrow lane
Into the blackness, out of grave Madrid
All fire and shine, abrupt as when there's slid
Its stiff gold blazing pall
From some black coffin-lid.
Or, best of all,
I love to think
The leaving us was just a feint;
Back here to London did he slink,
And now works on without a wink
Of sleep, and we are on the brink
Of something great in fresco-paint:
Some garret's ceiling, walls and floor,
Up and down and o'er and o'er
He splashes, as none splashed before
Since great Caldara Polidore.
Or Music means this land of ours
Some favour yet, to pity won
By Purcell from his Rosy Bowers--
"Give me my so-long promised son,
Let Waring end what I begun!"
Then down he creeps and out he steals
Only when the night conceals
His face; in Kent 'tis cherry-time,
Or hops are picking: or at prime
Of March he wanders as, too happy,
Years ago when he was young,
Some mild eve when woods grew sappy
And the early moths had sprung
To life from many a trembling sheath
Woven the warm boughs beneath;
While small birds said to themselves
What should soon be actual song,
And young gnats, by tens and twelves,
Made as if they were the throng
That crowd around and carry aloft
The sound they have nursed, so sweet and pure,
Out of a myriad noises soft,
Into a tone that can endure
Amid the noise of a July noon
When all God's creatures crave their boon,
All at once and all in tune,
And get it, happy as Waring then,
Having first within his ken
What a man might do with men:
And far too glad, in the even-glow,
To mix with the world he meant to take
Into his hand, he told you, so--
And out of it his world to make,
To contract and to expand
As he shut or oped his hand.
Oh Waring, what's to really be?
A clear stage and a crowd to see!
Some Garrick, say, out shall not he
The heart of Hamlet's mystery pluck?
Or, where most unclean beasts are rife,
Some Junius--am I right?--shall tuck
His sleeve, and forth with flaying-knife!
Some Chatterton shall have the luck
Of calling Rowley into life!
Some one shall somehow run a muck
With this old world for want of strife
Sound asleep. Contrive, contrive
To rouse us, Waring! Who's alive?
Our men scarce seem in earnest now.
Distinguished names!--but 'tis, somehow,
As if they played at being names
Still more distinguished, like the games
Of children. Turn our sport to earnest
With a visage of the sternest!
Bring the real times back, confessed
Still better than our very best!

"When I last saw Waring..."
(How all turned to him who spoke!
You saw Waring? Truth or joke?
In land-travel or sea-faring?)

"We were sailing by Triest
Where a day or two we harboured:
A sunset was in the West,
When, looking over the vessel's side,
One of our company espied
A sudden speck to larboard.
And as a sea-duck flies and swims
At once, so came the light craft up,
With its sole lateen sail that trims
And turns (the water round its rims
Dancing, as round a sinking cup)
And by us like a fish it curled,
And drew itself up close beside,
Its great sail on the instant furled,
And o'er its thwarts a shrill voice cried,
(A neck as bronzed as a Lascar's)
'Buy wine of us, you English Brig?
Or fruit, tobacco and cigars?
A pilot for you to Triest?
Without one, look you ne'er so big,
They'll never let you up the bay!
We natives should know best.'
I turned, and 'just those fellows' way,'
Our captain said, 'The 'long-shore thieves
Are laughing at us in their sleeves.'

"In truth, the boy leaned laughing back;
And one, half-hidden by his side
Under the furled sail, soon I spied,
With great grass hat and kerchief black,
Who looked up with his kingly throat,
Said somewhat, while the other shook
His hair back from his eyes to look
Their longest at us; then the boat,
I know not how, turned sharply round,
Laying her whole side on the sea
As a leaping fish does; from the lee
Into the weather, cut somehow
Her sparkling path beneath our bow
And so went off, as with a bound,
Into the rosy and golden half
O' the sky, to overtake the sun
And reach the shore, like the sea-calf
Its singing cave; yet I caught one
Glance ere away the boat quite passed,
And neither time nor toil could mar
Those features: so I saw the last
Of Waring!"--You?  Oh, never star
Was lost here but it rose afar!
Look East, where whole new thousands are!
In Vishnu-land what Avatar?
```

## The Soldier by Rupert Brooke

```
If I should die, think only this of me:
That there's some corner of a foreign field
That is for ever England. There shall be
In that rich earth a richer dust concealed;
A dust whom England bore, shaped, made aware,
Gave once her flowers to love, her ways to roam;
A body of England's, breathing English air,
Washed by the rivers, blest by suns of home.
And think, this heart, all evil shed away,
A pulse in the eternal mind, no less
Gives somewhere back the thoughts by England given;
Her sights and sounds; dreams happy as her day;
And laughter, learnt of friends; and gentleness,
In hearts at peace, under an English heaven.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

Rupert Brooke's poem "The Soldier" is structured as a Petrarchan sonnet, consisting of an octet followed by a sestet. The octet presents the speaker's thoughts on death and legacy, while the sestet shifts to a more hopeful and reflective tone. The poem follows a strict rhyme scheme of ABABCDCD in the octet and EFGGFG in the sestet. 

In terms of meter, the poem predominantly follows iambic pentameter, with lines such as "That there's some corner of a foreign field" and "A pulse in the eternal mind, no less" adhering to this rhythmic pattern. However, Brooke occasionally deviates from strict iambic pentameter to emphasize certain words or ideas, adding variation and depth to the poem's structure.

### Themes and Imagery

One of the central themes of "The Soldier" is patriotism and the idea of sacrificing oneself for the greater good of one's country. The speaker expresses a deep love for England, referring to a foreign field as "for ever England" and portraying the soil as a sacred place where English soldiers find eternal rest. The imagery of England's natural beauty, with its rivers, suns, and flowers, evokes a sense of nostalgia and pride in the speaker's homeland.

Another prominent theme is the concept of immortality through memory and legacy. The speaker believes that even in death, their essence will live on through the thoughts, sights, sounds, and laughter of England. This idea of transcending physical existence and becoming a part of a collective memory adds a layer of spiritual and emotional depth to the poem.

### Literary Devices

Brooke employs various literary devices to enhance the poem's impact. One such device is personification, as seen in the lines "A body of England's, breathing English air" where England is portrayed as a nurturing mother figure shaping and giving life to its people. The use of alliteration in phrases like "her sights and sounds" and "dreams happy as her day" creates a musical quality and emphasizes the connection between the speaker and England.

The poem also features powerful imagery, such as the contrast between the foreign field and England, symbolizing the dual nature of the soldier's identity. The use of metaphor, as in "A dust whom England bore, shaped, made aware," adds depth to the speaker's reflections on life and death.

### Historical and Personal Context

"The Soldier" was written during World War I, a time of great turmoil and sacrifice in British history. Brooke himself served in the war and was deeply affected by the loss of his fellow soldiers. This context lends a sense of authenticity and emotional weight to the poem, as it reflects the experiences and sentiments of those who fought and died for their country.

Brooke's personal connection to the war and his own contemplations on mortality and legacy likely influenced the themes and imagery present in "The Soldier." The poem serves as a tribute to the bravery and spirit of the soldiers who gave their lives in service to England, capturing the essence of sacrifice and honor in the face of war.

### Deep Reading

At its core, "The Soldier" is a meditation on the enduring power of love and memory in the face of mortality. The speaker's belief in the eternal legacy of England and the interconnectedness of past, present, and future generations underscores a profound sense of continuity and belonging. By emphasizing the spiritual and emotional ties that bind individuals to their homeland, Brooke elevates the soldier's sacrifice to a symbol of collective identity and shared history.

The poem's shifting tones, from contemplative reflection to hopeful affirmation, mirror the complex emotions associated with death and remembrance. Through its exploration of themes such as patriotism, immortality, and the transience of life, "The Soldier" invites readers to ponder the significance of sacrifice and the enduring legacy of those who have given their lives for a greater cause.
