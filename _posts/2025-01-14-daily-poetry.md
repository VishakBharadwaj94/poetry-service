## Sonnet 38 - First time he kissed me, he but only kissed by Elizabeth Barrett Browning

```
First time he kissed me, he but only kissed
The fingers of this hand wherewith I write;
And ever since, it grew more clean and white,
Slow to world-greetings, quick with its 'Oh, list,'
When the angels speak. A ring of amethyst
I could not wear here, plainer to my sight,
Than that first kiss. The second passed in height
The first, and sought the forehead, and half missed,
Half falling on the hair. O beyond meed!
That was the chrism of love, which love's own crown,
With sanctifying sweetness, did precede.
The third upon my lips was folded down
In perfect, purple state; since when, indeed,
I have been proud and said, 'My love, my own.'
```

## A Day Dream by Emily Bronte

```
On a sunny brae, alone I lay
One summer afternoon;
It was the marriage-time of May
With her young lover, June.

From her mother's heart, seemed loath to part
That queen of bridal charms,
But her father smiled on the fairest child
He ever held in his arms.

The trees did wave their plumy crests,
The glad birds caroled clear;
And I, of all the wedding guests,
Was only sullen there!

There was not one, but wished to shun
My aspect void of cheer;
The very grey rocks, looking on,
Asked, "What do you here?"

And I could utter no reply;
In sooth, I did not know
Why I had brought a clouded eye
To greet the general glow.

So, resting on a heathy bank,
I took my heart to me;
And we together sadly sank
Into a reverie.

We thought, "When winter comes again,
Where will these bright things be?
All vanished, like a vision vain,
An unreal mockery!

The birds that now so blithely sing,
Through deserts, frozen dry,
Poor spectres of the perished spring,
In famished troops, will fly.

And why should we be glad at all?
The leaf is hardly green,
Before a token of its fall
Is on the surface seen!"

Now, whether it were really so,
I never could be sure;
But as in fit of peevish woe,
I stretched me on the moor.

A thousand thousand gleaming fires
Seemed kindling in the air;
A thousand thousand silvery lyres
Resounded far and near:

Methought, the very breath I breathed
Was full of sparks divine,
And all my heather-couch was wreathed
By that celestial shine!

And, while the wide earth echoing rung
To their strange minstrelsy,
The little glittering spirits sung,
Or seemed to sing, to me.

"O mortal! mortal! let them die;
Let time and tears destroy,
That we may overflow the sky
With universal joy!

Let grief distract the sufferer's breast,
And night obscure his way;
They hasten him to endless rest,
And everlasting day.

To thee the world is like a tomb,
A desert's naked shore;
To us, in unimagined bloom,
It brightens more and more!

And could we lift the veil, and give
One brief glimpse to thine eye,
Thou wouldst rejoice for those that live,
Because they live to die."

The music ceased; the noonday dream,
Like dream of night, withdrew;
But Fancy, still, will sometimes deem
Her fond creation true.
```

The irregular structure and rhyme scheme contribute to the dreamlike quality of the poem, mirroring the wandering thoughts of the speaker.

### Themes and Imagery

The central themes of the poem revolve around the fleeting nature of beauty and happiness, the contrast between the natural world and human emotions, and the idea of mortality. The imagery in the poem is vivid and evocative, painting a picture of a sunny day in nature juxtaposed with the speaker's inner turmoil. The imagery of the wedding between May and June symbolizes the fleeting nature of happiness and the inevitability of change. The contrast between the joyful wedding guests and the sullen speaker highlights the speaker's sense of alienation and introspection.

### Literary Devices

Bronte employs several literary devices throughout the poem to enhance its meaning and mood. One notable device is personification, as seen in lines such as "The trees did wave their plumy crests" and "The very grey rocks, looking on." These personifications give life to the natural world and emphasize the speaker's sense of detachment from it. The use of symbolism is also prevalent in the poem, with the changing seasons and natural elements representing broader themes of transition and impermanence.

Emily Bronte, known for her introspective and often melancholic poetry, likely drew inspiration from her own experiences and emotions when writing "A Day Dream." The poem reflects the Romantic era's fascination with nature and the human psyche, as well as the themes of transience and mortality that were common in Romantic literature. Bronte's personal struggles and isolation may have influenced the speaker's sense of alienation and melancholy in the poem.

### Deep Reading

Through the speaker's daydream, Bronte delves into deeper philosophical questions about life, death, and the nature of existence. The contrast between the earthly realm and the celestial realm, as depicted by the spirits in the poem, highlights the speaker's struggle to find meaning and purpose in a world filled with impermanence and suffering.
