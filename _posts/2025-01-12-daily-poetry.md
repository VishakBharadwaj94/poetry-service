## Fragment: To the Mind of Man by Percy Bysshe Shelley

```
Thou living light that in thy rainbow hues
Clothest this naked world; and over Sea
And Earth and air, and all the shapes that be
In peopled darkness of this wondrous world
The Spirit of thy glory dost diffuse
... truth ... thou Vital Flame
Mysterious thought that in this mortal frame
Of things, with unextinguished lustre burnest
Now pale and faint now high to Heaven upcurled
That eer as thou dost languish still returnest
And ever
Before the ... before the Pyramids

So soon as from the Earth formless and rude
One living step had chased drear Solitude
Thou wert, Thought; thy brightness charmed the lids
Of the vast snake Eternity, who kept
The tree of good and evil.--
```

## My Star by Robert Browning

```
All that I know
  Of a certain star
Is, it can throw
  (Like the angled spar)
Now a dart of red,
  Now a dart of blue;
Till my friends have said
  They would fain see, too,
My star that dartles the red and the blue!

Then it stops like a bird; like a flower, hangs furled:
They must solace themselves with the Saturn above it.
What matter to me if their star is a world?
Mine has opened its soul to me; therefore I love it.
```

## Hayeswater by Matthew Arnold

```
A region desolate and wild.
Black, chafing water: and afloat,
And lonely as a truant child
In a waste wood, a single boat:
No mast, no sails are set thereon;
It moves, but never moveth on:
And welters like a human thing
Amid the wild waves weltering.

Behind, a buried vale doth sleep,
Far down the torrent cleaves its way:
In front the dumb rock rises steep,
A fretted wall of blue and grey;
Of shooting cliff and crumbled stone
With many a wild weed overgrown:
All else, black water: and afloat,
One rood from shore, that single boat.
```

### Themes and Imagery

The overarching theme of "Hayeswater" revolves around desolation and isolation, as Arnold paints a vivid picture of a bleak and lonely landscape. The imagery in the poem is stark and evocative, emphasizing the wildness and emptiness of the surroundings. The black, chafing water, the single boat adrift with no sails, and the buried vale all contribute to a sense of abandonment and solitude. The description of the landscape as "desolate and wild" sets the tone for the entire poem, highlighting the raw and untamed nature of the setting.

### Literary Devices

Arnold employs various literary devices to enhance the imagery and mood of the poem. One notable device is personification, as he describes the boat as "lonely as a truant child" and as a "human thing amid the wild waves weltering."
