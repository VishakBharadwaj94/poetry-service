## Lord Walter's Wife by Elizabeth Barrett Browning

```
I

'But where do you go?' said the lady, while both sat under the yew,
And her eyes were alive in their depth, as the kraken beneath the sea-blue.

II

'Because I fear you,' he answered;--'because you are far too fair,
And able to strangle my soul in a mesh of your golfd-coloured hair.'

III

'Oh that,' she said, 'is no reason! Such knots are quickly undone,
And too much beauty, I reckon, is nothing but too much sun.'

IV

'Yet farewell so,' he answered; --'the sunstroke's fatal at times.
I value your husband, Lord Walter, whose gallop rings still from the limes.

V

'Oh that,' she said, 'is no reason. You smell a rose through a fence:
If two should smell it what matter? who grumbles, and where's the pretense?

VI

'But I,' he replied, 'have promised another, when love was free,
To love her alone, alone, who alone from afar loves me.'

VII

'Why, that,' she said, 'is no reason. Love's always free I am told.
Will you vow to be safe from the headache on Tuesday, and think it will hold?

VIII

'But you,' he replied, 'have a daughter, a young child, who was laid
In your lap to be pure; so I leave you: the angels would make me afraid."

IX

'Oh that,' she said, 'is no reason. The angels keep out of the way;
And Dora, the child, observes nothing, although you should please me and stay.'

X

At which he rose up in his anger,--'Why now, you no longer are fair!
Why, now, you no longer are fatal, but ugly and hateful, I swear.'

XI

At which she laughed out in her scorn: 'These men! Oh these men overnice,
Who are shocked if a colour not virtuous is frankly put on by a vice.'

XII

Her eyes blazed upon him--'And you! You bring us your vices so near
That we smell them! You think in our presence a thought 'twould defame us to hear!

XIII

'What reason had you, and what right,--I appel to your soul from my life,--
To find me so fair as a woman? Why, sir, I am pure, and a wife.

XIV

'Is the day-star too fair up above you? It burns you not. Dare you imply
I brushed you more close than the star does, when Walter had set me as high?

XV

'If a man finds a woman too fair, he means simply adapted too much
To use unlawful and fatal. The praise! --shall I thank you for such?

XVI

'Too fair?--not unless you misuse us! and surely if, once in a while,
You attain to it, straightaway you call us no longer too fair, but too vile.

XVII

'A moment,--I pray your attention!--I have a poor word in my head
I must utter, though womanly custom would set it down better unsaid.

XVIII

'You grew, sir, pale to impertinence, once when I showed you a ring.
You kissed my fan when I dropped it. No matter! I've broken the thing.

XIX

'You did me the honour, perhaps, to be moved at my side now and then
In the senses--a vice, I have heard, which is common to beasts and some men.

XX

'Love's a virtue for heroes!--as white as the snow on high hills,
And immortal as every great soul is that struggles, endures, and fulfils.

XXI
'I love my Walter profoundly,--you, Maude, though you faltered a week,
For the sake of . . . what is it--an eyebrow? or, less still, a mole on the cheek?

XXII
'And since, when all's said, you're too noble to stoop to the frivolous cant
About crimes irresistable, virtues that swindle, betray and supplant.

XXIII

'I determined to prove to yourself that, whate'er you might dream or avow
By illusion, you wanted precisely no more of me than you have now.

XXIV

'There! Look me full in the face!--in the face. Understand, if you can,
That the eyes of such women as I am are clean as the palm of a man.

XXV
'Drop his hand, you insult him. Avoid us for fear we should cost you a scar--
You take us for harlots, I tell you, and not for the women we are.

XXVI

'You wronged me: but then I considered . . . there's Walter! And so at the end
I vowed that he should not be mulcted, by me, in the hand of a friend.

XXVII

'Have I hurt you indeed? We are quits then. Nay, friend of my Walter, be mine!
Come, Dora, my darling, my angel, and help me to ask him to dine.'

### Literary Devices

## Come hither, child by Emily Bronte

```
Come hither, child--who gifted thee
With power to touch that string so well?
How darest thou rouse up thoughts in me,
Thoughts that I would--but cannot quell?

Nay, chide not, lady; long ago
I heard those notes in Ula's hall,
And had I known they'd waken woe
I'd weep their music to recall.

But thus it was: one festal night
When I was hardly six years old
I stole away from crowds and light
And sought a chamber dark and cold.

I had no one to love me there,
I knew no comrade and no friend;
And so I went to sorrow where
Heaven, only heaven saw me bend.

Loud blew the wind; 'twas sad to stay
From all that splendour barred away.
I imaged in the lonely room
A thousand forms of fearful gloom.

And with my wet eyes raised on high
I prayed to God that I might die.
Suddenly in that silence drear
A sound of music reached my ear,

And then a note, I hear it yet,
So full of soul, so deeply sweet,
I thought that Gabriel's self had come
To take me to thy father's home.

Three times it rose, that seraph strain,
Then died, nor breathed again;
But still the words and still the tone
Dwell round my heart when all alone.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "Come hither, child" by Emily Bronte consists of a total of 36 lines divided into five stanzas. Each stanza varies in length, with the first stanza having four lines, the second and fourth stanzas having six lines, and the third and fifth stanzas having eight lines. The poem is written in a free verse form, without a consistent meter or rhyme scheme. This lack of regularity contributes to the poem's emotional and reflective tone, allowing the speaker to express their inner turmoil and memories in a raw and unstructured manner.

### Themes and Imagery

The poem explores themes of loneliness, longing, and the power of music to evoke deep emotions. The speaker addresses a child who possesses a talent for playing music that stirs up memories and emotions within them. The imagery in the poem is vivid and evocative, painting a picture of a young child seeking solace in a dark and lonely room. The contrast between the festivity outside and the speaker's solitude inside creates a sense of isolation and yearning for connection.

### Literary Devices

Bronte employs several literary devices in the poem to enhance its emotional impact. The use of personification is evident in lines such as "How darest thou rouse up thoughts in me," giving human qualities to the child's musical talent. The repetition of the word "heaven" emphasizes the speaker's plea for divine intervention in their sorrow. The imagery of the "sound of music" reaching the speaker's ear and the comparison to Gabriel's music evoke a sense of transcendence and spiritual connection.

### Historical and Personal Context

Emily Bronte, known for her introspective and emotionally charged poetry, often drew on her own experiences and emotions in her writing. The themes of loneliness and longing in "Come hither, child" reflect Bronte's own struggles with isolation and loss. The poem may also be influenced by the Romantic ideals of individualism and the power of nature to evoke deep emotions.

### Deep Reading

At its core, "Come hither, child" explores the transformative power of music in healing emotional wounds and fostering a connection with the divine. The speaker's recollection of a childhood moment of despair and the comforting presence of music highlights the cathartic effect of art in times of loneliness and sorrow. The repeated imagery of the music lingering in the speaker's heart emphasizes the lasting impact of moments of solace and beauty in the midst of darkness. Ultimately, the poem conveys a sense of hope and redemption through the transcendent power of music and memory.
