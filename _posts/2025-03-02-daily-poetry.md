## Cock-Crow by Edward Thomas

```
OUT of the wood of thoughts that grows by night
To be cut down by the sharp axe of light,--
Out of the night, two cocks together crow,
Cleaving the darkness with a silver blow:
And bright before my eyes twin trumpeters stand,
Heralds of splendour, one at either hand,
Each facing each as in a coat of arms:
The milkers lace their boots up at the farms.
```

## Hayeswater by Matthew Arnold

```
A region desolate and wild.
Black, chafing water: and afloat,
And lonely as a truant child
In a waste wood, a single boat:
No mast, no sails are set thereon;
It moves, but never moveth on:
And welters like a human thing
Amid the wild waves weltering.

Behind, a buried vale doth sleep,
Far down the torrent cleaves its way:
In front the dumb rock rises steep,
A fretted wall of blue and grey;
Of shooting cliff and crumbled stone
With many a wild weed overgrown:
All else, black water: and afloat,
One rood from shore, that single boat.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "Hayeswater" by Matthew Arnold consists of two quatrains, each with four lines. The rhyme scheme is ABAB CDCD, creating a sense of unity and balance in the poem. The meter is mostly iambic tetrameter, with lines alternating between four and three stressed syllables. This rhythmic pattern contributes to the overall flow of the poem and helps to emphasize certain key words and phrases.

### Themes and Imagery

The main themes in "Hayeswater" revolve around desolation, loneliness, and the power of nature. The poem paints a vivid picture of a barren and wild landscape, with the black, chafing water and the single boat symbolizing isolation and abandonment. The imagery of the boat as "lonely as a truant child" and "weltering like a human thing" evokes a sense of melancholy and helplessness. The description of the "dumb rock" and the "fretted wall of blue and grey" further emphasizes the harsh and unforgiving nature of the environment.

### Literary Devices

Arnold employs various literary devices to enhance the meaning of the poem. One notable device is personification, as the boat is described as moving but never moving on, weltering like a human thing. This personification adds a sense of life and emotion to the inanimate object, reinforcing the theme of loneliness and abandonment. Additionally, the use of alliteration in phrases like "black, chafing water" and "welters like a human thing" creates a musical quality to the language and draws attention to key images.

### Historical and Personal Context

Matthew Arnold was a Victorian poet known for his introspective and melancholic works. "Hayeswater" was written during a time of industrialization and social change in England, where many natural landscapes were being altered or destroyed. The poem reflects Arnold's concerns about the loss of untouched wilderness and the impact of human activity on the environment. The sense of desolation and isolation in the poem may also reflect Arnold's own feelings of alienation and disillusionment with society.

### Deep Reading

At its core, "Hayeswater" can be seen as a meditation on the transient nature of existence and the overwhelming power of nature. The image of the boat adrift on the black water, surrounded by desolate cliffs and overgrown weeds, suggests a sense of futility and insignificance in the face of the natural world. The repetition of the boat as a solitary figure emphasizes the theme of isolation and the idea of being adrift in a vast and indifferent universe. Ultimately, the poem invites the reader to contemplate the fragility of human existence and the enduring presence of the natural world.
