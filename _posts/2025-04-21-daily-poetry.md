## Strayed Reveller, The by Matthew Arnold

```
The Youth

Faster, faster,
O Circe, Goddess,
Let the wild, thronging train
The bright procession
Of eddying forms,
Sweep through my soul!
Thou standest, smiling
Down on me! thy right arm,
Lean'd up against the column there,
Props thy soft cheek;
Thy left holds, hanging loosely,
The deep cup, ivy-cinctured,
I held but now.
Is it, then, evening
So soon? I see, the night-dews,
Cluster'd in thick beads, dim
The agate brooch-stones
On thy white shoulder;
The cool night-wind, too,
Blows through the portico,
Stirs thy hair, Goddess,
Waves thy white robe!


Circe.

Whence art thou, sleeper?


The Youth.

When the white dawn first
Through the rough fir-planks
Of my hut, by the chestnuts,
Up at the valley-head,
Came breaking, Goddess!
I sprang up, I threw round me
My dappled fawn-skin;
Passing out, from the wet turf,
Where they lay, by the hut door,
I snatch'd up my vine-crown, my fir-staff,
All drench'd in dew-
Came swift down to join
The rout early gather'd
In the town, round the temple,
Iacchus' white fane
On yonder hill.
Quick I pass'd, following
The wood-cutters' cart-track
Down the dark valley;-I saw
On my left, through the beeches,
Thy palace, Goddess,
Smokeless, empty!
Trembling, I enter'd; beheld
The court all silent,
The lions sleeping,
On the altar this bowl.
I drank, Goddess!
And sank down here, sleeping,
On the steps of thy portico.


Circe.

Foolish boy! Why tremblest thou?
Thou lovest it, then, my wine?
Wouldst more of it? See, how glows,
Through the delicate, flush'd marble,
The red, creaming liquor,
Strown with dark seeds!
Drink, thee! I chide thee not,
Deny thee not my bowl.
Come, stretch forth thy hand, thee-so!
Drink-drink again!


The Youth.

Thanks, gracious one!
Ah, the sweet fumes again!
More soft, ah me,
More subtle-winding
Than Pan's flute-music!
Faint-faint! Ah me,
Again the sweet sleep!


Circe.

Hist! Thou-within there!
Come forth, Ulysses!
Art tired with hunting?
While we range the woodland,
See what the day brings.


Ulysses.

Ever new magic!
Hast thou then lured hither,
Wonderful Goddess, by thy art,
The young, languid-eyed Ampelus,
Iacchus' darling-
Or some youth beloved of Pan,
Of Pan and the Nymphs?
That he sits, bending downward
His white, delicate neck
To the ivy-wreathed marge
Of thy cup; the bright, glancing vine-leaves
That crown his hair,
Falling forward, mingling
With the dark ivy-plants--
His fawn-skin, half untied,
Smear'd with red wine-stains? Who is he,
That he sits, overweigh'd
By fumes of wine and sleep,
So late, in thy portico?
What youth, Goddess,-what guest
Of Gods or mortals?


Circe.

Hist! he wakes!
I lured him not hither, Ulysses.
Nay, ask him!


The Youth.

Who speaks' Ah, who comes forth
To thy side, Goddess, from within?
How shall I name him?
This spare, dark-featured,
Quick-eyed stranger?
Ah, and I see too
His sailor's bonnet,
His short coat, travel-tarnish'd,
With one arm bare!--
Art thou not he, whom fame
This long time rumours
The favour'd guest of Circe, brought by the waves?
Art thou he, stranger?
The wise Ulysses,
Laertes' son?


Ulysses.

I am Ulysses.
And thou, too, sleeper?
Thy voice is sweet.
It may be thou hast follow'd
Through the islands some divine bard,
By age taught many things,
Age and the Muses;
And heard him delighting
The chiefs and people
In the banquet, and learn'd his songs.
Of Gods and Heroes,
Of war and arts,
And peopled cities,
Inland, or built
By the gray sea.-If so, then hail!
I honour and welcome thee.


The Youth.

The Gods are happy.
They turn on all sides
Their shining eyes,
And see below them
The earth and men.
They see Tiresias
Sitting, staff in hand,
On the warm, grassy
Asopus bank,
His robe drawn over
His old sightless head,
Revolving inly
The doom of Thebes.
They see the Centaurs
In the upper glens
Of Pelion, in the streams,
Where red-berried ashes fringe
The clear-brown shallow pools,
With streaming flanks, and heads
Rear'd proudly, snuffing
The mountain wind.
They see the Indian
Drifting, knife in hand,
His frail boat moor'd to
A floating isle thick-matted
With large-leaved, low-creeping melon-plants
And the dark cucumber.
He reaps, and stows them,
Drifting--drifting;--round him,
Round his green harvest-plot,
Flow the cool lake-waves,
The mountains ring them.
They see the Scythian
On the wide stepp, unharnessing
His wheel'd house at noon.
He tethers his beast down, and makes his meal--
Mares' milk, and bread
Baked on the embers;--all around
The boundless, waving grass-plains stretch, thick-starr'd
With saffron and the yellow hollyhock
And flag-leaved iris-flowers.
Sitting in his cart
He makes his meal; before him, for long miles,
Alive with bright green lizards,
And the springing bustard-fowl,
The track, a straight black line,
Furrows the rich soil; here and there
Cluster of lonely mounds
Topp'd with rough-hewn,
Gray, rain-blear'd statues, overpeer
The sunny waste.
They see the ferry
On the broad, clay-laden
Lone Chorasmian stream;--thereon,
With snort and strain,
Two horses, strongly swimming, tow
The ferry-boat, with woven ropes
To either bow
Firm harness'd by the mane; a chief
With shout and shaken spear,
Stands at the prow, and guides them; but astern
The cowering merchants, in long robes,
Sit pale beside their wealth
Of silk-bales and of balsam-drops,
Of gold and ivory,
Of turquoise-earth and amethyst,
Jasper and chalcedony,
And milk-barred onyx-stones.
The loaded boat swings groaning
In the yellow eddies;
The Gods behold him.
They see the Heroes
Sitting in the dark ship
On the foamless, long-heaving
Violet sea.
At sunset nearing
The Happy Islands.
These things, Ulysses,
The wise bards, also
Behold and sing.
But oh, what labour!
O prince, what pain!
They too can see
Tiresias;--but the Gods,
Who give them vision,
Added this law:
That they should bear too
His groping blindness,
His dark foreboding,
His scorn'd white hairs;
Bear Hera's anger
Through a life lengthen'd
To seven ages.
They see the Centaurs
On Pelion:--then they feel,
They too, the maddening wine
Swell their large veins to bursting; in wild pain
They feel the biting spears
Of the grim Lapithж, and Theseus, drive,
Drive crashing through their bones; they feel
High on a jutting rock in the red stream
Alcmena's dreadful son
Ply his bow;--such a price
The Gods exact for song:
To become what we sing.
They see the Indian
On his mountain lake; but squalls
Make their skiff reel, and worms
In the unkind spring have gnawn
Their melon-harvest to the heart.--They see
The Scythian: but long frosts
Parch them in winter-time on the bare stepp,
Till they too fade like grass; they crawl
Like shadows forth in spring.
They see the merchants
On the Oxus stream;--but care
Must visit first them too, and make them pale.
Whether, through whirling sand,
A cloud of desert robber-horse have burst
Upon their caravan; or greedy kings,
In the wall'd cities the way passes through,
Crush'd them with tolls; or fever-airs,
On some great river's marge,
Mown them down, far from home.
They see the Heroes
Near harbour;--but they share
Their lives, and former violent toil in Thebes,
Seven-gated Thebes, or Troy;
Or where the echoing oars
Of Argo first
Startled the unknown sea.
The old Silenus
Came, lolling in the sunshine,
From the dewy forest-coverts,
This way at noon.
Sitting by me, while his Fauns
Down at the water-side
Sprinkled and smoothed
His drooping garland,
He told me these things.
But I, Ulysses,
Sitting on the warm steps,
Looking over the valley,
All day long, have seen,
Without pain, without labour,
Sometimes a wild-hair'd Mжnad--
Sometimes a Faun with torches--
And sometimes, for a moment,
Passing through the dark stems
Flowing-robed, the beloved,
The desired, the divine,
Beloved Iacchus.
Ah, cool night-wind, tremulous stars!
Ah, glimmering water,
Fitful earth-murmur,
Dreaming woods!
Ah, golden-haired, strangely smiling Goddess,
And thou, proved, much enduring,
Wave-toss'd Wanderer!
Who can stand still?
Ye fade, ye swim, ye waver before me--
The cup again!
Faster, faster,
O Circe, Goddess.
Let the wild, thronging train,
The bright procession
Of eddying forms,
Sweep through my soul!

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

"The Strayed Reveller" by Matthew Arnold is a narrative poem that consists of a dialogue between three characters: The Youth, Circe, and Ulysses. The poem is written in free verse, without a strict rhyme scheme or meter. The lack of rhyme and meter in the poem gives it a sense of fluidity and freedom, mirroring the dreamlike and chaotic nature of the Youth's experience with Circe. The structure of the poem is divided into sections based on the speakers, with each character's lines separated to clearly distinguish their voices.

### Themes and Imagery

One of the central themes in the poem is the allure of indulgence and escapism. The Youth is drawn to Circe's intoxicating wine, which symbolizes a desire to escape reality and experience pleasure without consequences. The imagery in the poem is rich and vivid, creating a dreamlike atmosphere. The description of Circe, the setting of her palace, and the sensory details of the wine all contribute to the theme of indulgence and the seductive power of illusion.

The poem also explores themes of transformation and the consequences of succumbing to temptation. Circe's ability to transform men into animals reflects the idea of losing one's humanity when giving in to base desires. The Youth's transformation under Circe's influence serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of hedonism and the loss of self-control.

### Literary Devices

Arnold employs various literary devices to enhance the themes and imagery in the poem. Imagery is used extensively to create a vivid picture of Circe's palace, the effects of the wine, and the sensory experiences of the characters. Personification is evident in the portrayal of Circe as a goddess and the anthropomorphization of natural elements like the night-wind. Dialogue is a key device in the poem, as the interactions between the characters reveal their motivations and relationships.

Symbolism is also prevalent in the poem, with the wine symbolizing temptation and the consequences of giving in to one's desires. The figure of Ulysses serves as a moral compass, contrasting with the Youth's reckless abandon. The use of mythological allusions adds depth to the narrative, drawing on the classical story of Circe and Ulysses to explore timeless themes of temptation and transformation.

### Historical and Personal Context

Matthew Arnold was a Victorian poet and critic known for his introspective and philosophical works. "The Strayed Reveller" was published in 1849 as part of Arnold's early poetry collection. The poem reflects the Romantic and Symbolist influences prevalent in Arnold's writing, as well as his interest in classical mythology and moral themes.

The poem can be seen as a reflection of the tensions between indulgence and restraint in Victorian society, as well as Arnold's own struggles with the conflicting desires for pleasure and self-discipline. The character of Ulysses, representing wisdom and self-control, may be a reflection of Arnold's own ideals and beliefs about the importance of moral integrity in the face of temptation.

### Deep Reading

At its core, "The Strayed Reveller" delves into the timeless struggle between hedonism and self-discipline, exploring the consequences of yielding to temptation. The Youth's descent into Circe's world symbolizes the seductive power of escapism and the dangers of losing oneself in pleasure. Through the dialogue between the characters, Arnold raises questions about the nature of desire, the pursuit of wisdom, and the cost of indulgence.

Ultimately, the poem serves as a meditation on the complexities of human nature and the eternal battle between the pursuit of pleasure and the quest for self-awareness. Arnold's lyrical language and evocative imagery draw the reader into a world of illusions and desires, challenging them to consider the consequences of straying from the path of self-knowledge and moral integrity.

## The Moon is distant from the Sea by Emily Dickinson

```
The Moon is distant from the Sea --
And yet, with Amber Hands --
She leads Him -- docile as a Boy --
Along appointed Sands --

He never misses a Degree --
Obedient to Her Eye
He comes just so far -- toward the Town --
Just so far -- goes away --

Oh, Signor, Thine, the Amber Hand --
And mine -- the distant Sea --
Obedient to the least command
Thine eye impose on me --
```

### Literary Devices

Additionally, the repetition of the phrase "Just so far" in lines 7 and 8 emphasizes the controlled and measured nature of the Sea's movements.

### Deep Reading

The poem raises questions about the nature of obedience, agency, and the boundaries of control in interpersonal relationships. Ultimately, Dickinson's poem invites readers to consider the complexities of power dynamics and the ways in which they shape our interactions with others.

## My Star by Robert Browning

```
All that I know
  Of a certain star
Is, it can throw
  (Like the angled spar)
Now a dart of red,
  Now a dart of blue;
Till my friends have said
  They would fain see, too,
My star that dartles the red and the blue!

Then it stops like a bird; like a flower, hangs furled:
They must solace themselves with the Saturn above it.
What matter to me if their star is a world?
Mine has opened its soul to me; therefore I love it.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

This structured rhyme scheme contributes to the overall musicality and flow of the poem. 

The meter of the poem is predominantly iambic, with lines such as "All that I know" and "Like the angled spar" following a pattern of unstressed syllable followed by a stressed syllable. This regular meter helps to maintain the poem's rhythm and enhances its readability.

### Themes and Imagery

One of the central themes of "My Star" is the idea of individuality and personal connection. The speaker expresses a deep affection for a specific star, which he describes as unique and special to him. This theme is highlighted through the imagery of the star "dartling" red and blue, symbolizing its dynamic and captivating nature. The comparison of the star to a bird and a flower further emphasizes its beauty and significance in the speaker's life.

Additionally, the poem touches on the theme of perspective and subjective experience. While others may find solace in looking at Saturn, the speaker finds true comfort and love in his own star. This contrast underscores the idea that personal connections and perceptions can hold more value and meaning than universally recognized symbols or objects.

### Literary Devices

Browning employs several literary devices to enhance the poem's impact. The use of imagery, such as the star throwing darts of red and blue, creates a vivid and engaging visual representation of the speaker's fascination and admiration. The personification of the star, described as having "opened its soul" to the speaker, adds a sense of intimacy and emotional depth to the relationship between the speaker and the celestial body.

The repetition of the word "dart" in the poem not only creates a rhythmic effect but also emphasizes the star's vibrant and dynamic nature. Additionally, the similes comparing the star to a bird and a flower help to further illustrate its beauty and uniqueness in the speaker's eyes.

### Historical and Personal Context

The poem can be interpreted as a reflection of Browning's own views on the importance of personal connections and the beauty of the natural world.

During the Victorian era, there was a growing interest in astronomy and the study of the cosmos. Browning's portrayal of the star in the poem may have been influenced by the fascination with celestial bodies and the sense of wonder they inspired during this period.

### Deep Reading

On a deeper level, "My Star" can be seen as a metaphor for the power of personal relationships and the impact of finding something or someone that resonates deeply with one's soul. The speaker's intense love for the star symbolizes the profound emotional connection that can be formed with seemingly insignificant or distant objects.

The contrast between the speaker's star and the more conventional symbol of Saturn suggests a rejection of societal norms and a celebration of individuality. By choosing to focus on his own star, the speaker asserts the importance of personal experiences and connections over external validation or recognition.

Overall, "My Star" is a poignant exploration of love, beauty, and the subjective nature of human perception. Through its vivid imagery, emotional depth, and thematic richness, the poem invites readers to reflect on the significance of personal connections and the unique ways in which we each find meaning and solace in the world around us.
