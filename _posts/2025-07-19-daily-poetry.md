## The Clouds That Are so Light by Edward Thomas

```
THE clouds that are so light,
Beautiful, swift and bright,
Cast shadows on field and park
Of the earth that is so dark,

And even so now, light one!
Beautiful, swift and bright one!
You let fall on a heart that was dark,
Unillumined, a deeper mark.

But clouds would have, without earth
To shadow, far less worth:
Away from your shadow on me
Your beauty less would be,

And if it still be treasured
An age hence, it shall be measured
By this small dark spot
Without which it were not.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "The Clouds That Are so Light" by Edward Thomas consists of four quatrains, each with a rhyme scheme of ABAB. The meter is irregular, with varying line lengths and stresses. This lack of strict meter contributes to the natural and flowing feel of the poem, mirroring the movement of clouds in the sky. The structure of the poem is simple yet effective, with each quatrain building upon the previous one to create a cohesive whole.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem revolves around the contrast between light and darkness, both in a literal and metaphorical sense. The clouds, described as "light, Beautiful, swift and bright," symbolize beauty and brightness in contrast to the darkness of the earth below. This imagery of light and shadow highlights the idea that darkness is necessary to appreciate and enhance the beauty of light. The poem also explores the idea of how darkness and shadows can deepen and enrich our experiences, as seen in the lines, "You let fall on a heart that was dark, Unillumined, a deeper mark."

### Literary Devices

Thomas employs several literary devices to enhance the meaning and impact of the poem. One such device is personification, as the clouds are described as having qualities such as beauty, swiftness, and brightness. This personification serves to make the clouds more relatable and emphasizes their importance in shaping the speaker's perception of the world. Additionally, the use of imagery, particularly the contrast between light and darkness, helps to create a vivid and evocative picture in the reader's mind. The repetition of the phrase "Beautiful, swift and bright" reinforces the significance of these qualities and underscores their impact on the speaker.

### Historical and Personal Context

Edward Thomas was a British poet who lived during the early 20th century and was deeply influenced by the natural world. His poems often reflect his love of nature and his contemplation of its beauty and meaning. In the context of this poem, Thomas may be exploring the idea that darkness and shadows are necessary aspects of life that enhance our appreciation of light and beauty. This theme of contrast and balance between light and darkness resonates with the broader themes of Thomas's work, which often grappled with the complexities of human emotions and experiences.

### Deep Reading

On a deeper level, "The Clouds That Are so Light" can be seen as a reflection on the interconnectedness of light and darkness in our lives. The poem suggests that without darkness, light would lose its significance and beauty. The speaker acknowledges the importance of shadows in shaping our perceptions and experiences, suggesting that even our darkest moments can leave a lasting impact on us. By exploring the interplay between light and darkness, Thomas invites readers to consider the ways in which contrasting elements can work together to create a richer and more nuanced understanding of the world around us.

## Sympathy by Emily Bronte

```
There should be no despair for you
While nightly stars are burning,
While evening pours its silent dew
And sunshine gilds the morning.
There should be no despair - though tears
May flow down like a river:
Are not the best beloved of years
Around your heart forever?

They weep - you weep - it must be so;
Winds sigh as you are sighing,
And Winter sheds his grief in snow
Where Autumn's leaves are lying:
Yet these revive, and from their fate
Your fate cannot be parted,
Then journey on, if not elate,
Still, never broken-hearted!
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

In terms of form, Emily Bronte's poem "Sympathy" consists of four stanzas, each with four lines. The poem follows a consistent rhyme scheme of ABAB, with alternating end rhymes in each stanza. This structure creates a sense of balance and symmetry in the poem, which complements the theme of finding solace and hope in difficult times.

### Themes and Imagery

One of the central themes of "Sympathy" is the idea of finding comfort and strength in the midst of sorrow and despair. Bronte uses vivid imagery throughout the poem to convey this theme, such as "nightly stars burning," "evening pours its silent dew," and "sunshine gilds the morning." These images evoke a sense of nature's beauty and constancy, serving as a reminder that even in moments of darkness, there is light and hope to be found.

The imagery of tears flowing like a river and winds sighing in sympathy with the speaker emphasizes the universal experience of suffering and the interconnectedness of human emotions. The changing seasons of Winter and Autumn symbolize the cyclical nature of life and the inevitability of change, yet also offer the promise of renewal and regeneration.

### Literary Devices

Bronte employs several literary devices in "Sympathy" to enhance the poem's emotional resonance. The repetition of the phrase "There should be no despair" reinforces the speaker's message of hope and resilience in the face of adversity. The use of personification, such as Winter shedding grief in snow and Autumn's leaves lying, adds depth to the imagery and imbues nature with human-like qualities.

The metaphor of tears flowing like a river and the comparison of the speaker's sorrow to the sighing winds create a sense of empathy and shared experience. The use of alliteration in "silent dew" and "sunshine gilds" adds a lyrical quality to the poem, enhancing its musicality and emotional impact.

### Historical and Personal Context

As a member of the literary Bronte family, she was surrounded by creativity and literary talent, which may have influenced her poetic style and themes.

The Victorian era in which Bronte lived was marked by societal expectations and constraints, particularly for women. This context of repression and conformity may have informed Bronte's exploration of themes such as sorrow, resilience, and the power of nature to provide solace and comfort in times of hardship.

### Deep Reading

The repeated reassurance that "There should be no despair" serves as a reminder to the reader that even in moments of darkness, there is always the possibility of light and hope. The imagery of nature's beauty and constancy underscores the idea that life is cyclical, and that even in times of sorrow, there is the potential for renewal and growth.

The interconnectedness of human emotions and experiences, as depicted through the imagery of tears, winds, and changing seasons, emphasizes the universal nature of suffering and the importance of empathy and compassion. By urging the reader to "journey on, if not elate, still, never broken-hearted," Bronte encourages resilience and perseverance in the face of life's challenges.

Overall, "Sympathy" conveys a powerful message of hope and strength, reminding the reader of the enduring power of the human spirit to overcome adversity and find solace in the beauty of the natural world.

## 1914 V: The Soldier by Rupert Brooke

```
If I should die, think only this of me:
That there's some corner of a foreign field
That is for ever England. There shall be
In that rich earth a richer dust concealed;
A dust whom England bore, shaped, made aware,
Gave, once, her flowers to love, her ways to roam,
A body of England's, breathing English air,
Washed by the rivers, blest by suns of home.

And think, this heart, all evil shed away,
A pulse in the eternal mind, no less
Gives somewhere back the thoughts by England given;
Her sights and sounds; dreams happy as her day;
And laughter, learnt of friends; and gentleness,
In hearts at peace, under an English heaven.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

In terms of form, Rupert Brooke's poem "The Soldier" is structured as a Petrarchan sonnet, consisting of an octave followed by a sestet. The octave sets up the premise of the poem, with the speaker reflecting on his potential death in battle and the idea that a part of him will forever belong to England. The sestet then expands on this idea, emphasizing the eternal connection between the soldier and his homeland.

The poem is written in iambic pentameter, with five stressed syllables per line, which gives the poem a steady and rhythmic flow. The rhyme scheme of the sonnet is ABBAABBACDECDE, typical of a Petrarchan sonnet, with the octave presenting a problem or situation and the sestet offering a resolution or conclusion.

### Themes and Imagery

One of the central themes of "The Soldier" is patriotism and sacrifice. The speaker expresses a deep love for his country, England, and envisions that even if he dies in a foreign land, a part of him will always remain connected to his homeland. This theme is reinforced through vivid imagery, such as "a richer dust concealed" and "breathing English air," which evoke a sense of the soldier's physical and spiritual ties to England.

The poem also explores themes of memory and legacy, as the speaker imagines that his heart will continue to resonate with the thoughts, sights, and sounds of England even after his death. The imagery of "dreams happy as her day" and "laughter, learnt of friends" conveys a sense of nostalgia and longing for the familiar comforts of home.

### Literary Devices

Brooke employs several literary devices in "The Soldier" to enhance the poem's emotional impact. One such device is personification, as England is personified as a nurturing mother figure who shapes and guides her children. This personification adds a sense of intimacy and warmth to the speaker's relationship with his homeland.

The poem also uses imagery extensively to create a vivid picture of the soldier's connection to England. The imagery of "washed by the rivers, blest by suns of home" appeals to the senses and reinforces the idea of the soldier being rooted in the landscape and culture of his country.

Additionally, the repetition of the word "England" throughout the poem serves to emphasize the soldier's deep-seated allegiance and attachment to his homeland, reinforcing the theme of patriotism.

### Historical and Personal Context

Written in 1914 at the beginning of World War I, "The Soldier" reflects the patriotic fervor and sense of duty that characterized the attitudes of many young men who enlisted to fight for their countries. Rupert Brooke himself was a soldier in the British Army during the war, and his experiences likely influenced the themes of sacrifice and national pride present in the poem.

The poem also speaks to the broader cultural context of the time, when notions of nationalism and duty were prevalent and when the idea of a "glorious death" for one's country was romanticized. The sense of duty and honor associated with serving in the military is evident in the speaker's willingness to give his life for England.

### Deep Reading

On a deeper level, "The Soldier" can be seen as a meditation on the enduring power of memory and the ways in which individuals seek to preserve their identity and legacy. The speaker's belief that a part of him will always belong to England suggests a desire for immortality and a yearning to be remembered beyond death.

The poem also raises questions about the nature of sacrifice and the significance of one's homeland in shaping one's sense of self. By linking the soldier's identity so closely to England, Brooke explores the complex interplay between personal and national identity and the ways in which individuals navigate their allegiances and loyalties.

Ultimately, "The Soldier" serves as a poignant reflection on the ties that bind individuals to their country and the enduring impact of war on the lives of those who serve. Brooke's evocative language and heartfelt sentiments capture the emotional weight of patriotism and sacrifice, resonating with readers on both a personal and universal level.
