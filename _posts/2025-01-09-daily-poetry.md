## Is it Well with the Child? by Christina Rossetti

```
SAFE where I cannot die yet,
   Safe where I hope to lie too,
Safe from the fume and the fret;
   You, and you,
   Whom I never forget.
Safe from the frost and the snow,
   Safe from the storm and the sun,
Safe where the seeds wait to grow
   One by one,
   And to come back in blow.
```

The repeated use of the word "safe" emphasizes the speaker's longing for a place of peace and comfort.

### Literary Devices

Rossetti employs several literary devices in the poem to enhance its emotional impact. The repetition of the word "safe" throughout the poem serves as an anaphora, reinforcing the speaker's yearning for security. The use of alliteration in phrases like "fume and fret" and "seeds wait to grow" adds a musical quality to the poem and draws attention to these key images. Additionally, the personification of seeds waiting to grow and come back in blow suggests a sense of renewal and rebirth.

### Historical and Personal Context

Christina Rossetti was a Victorian poet known for her introspective and spiritual poetry. As a devout Christian, themes of faith, mortality, and salvation often permeate her work. In this poem, the speaker's desire for safety may reflect Rossetti's own search for spiritual refuge and reassurance in the face of life's uncertainties. The poem's focus on finding solace in a place beyond earthly troubles also resonates with the Victorian era's preoccupation with death and the afterlife.

### Deep Reading

The speaker's yearning for a place of eternal safety and tranquility speaks to universal themes of longing for a sense of belonging and protection. The imagery of seeds waiting to grow and come back in blow can be seen as a metaphor for the cyclical nature of life and the hope for renewal and regeneration. Ultimately, the poem invites reflection on the inevitability of change and the enduring human quest for a sense of peace and stability.

## Sympathy by Paul Laurence Dunbar

```
I know what the caged bird feels, alas!
When the sun is bright on the upland slopes;
When the wind stirs soft through the springing grass,
And the river flows like a stream of glass;
When the first bird sings and the first bud opes,
And the faint perfume from its chalice steals--
I know what the caged bird feels!

I know why the caged bird beats his wing
Till its blood is red on the cruel bars;
For he must fly back to his perch and cling
When he fain would be on the bough a-swing;
And a pain still throbs in the old, old scars
And they pulse again with a keener sting--
I know why he beats his wing!

I know why the caged bird sings, ah me,
When his wing is bruised and his bosom sore,--
When he beats his bars and he would be free;
It is not a carol of joy or glee,
But a prayer that he sends from his heart's deep core,
But a plea, that upward to Heaven he flings--
I know why the caged bird sings!
```

### Analysis

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "Sympathy" by Paul Laurence Dunbar consists of three stanzas, each with a consistent rhyme scheme of ABABCDCD. This rhyme scheme creates a musical quality to the poem and helps to unify the stanzas. The poem is written in iambic tetrameter, with lines alternating between four stressed syllables and four unstressed syllables. This rhythmic pattern gives the poem a sense of flow and movement, mirroring the emotions expressed by the caged bird. The structure of the poem, with its regular rhyme scheme and meter, contributes to its musicality and reinforces the themes of captivity and longing.

### Themes and Imagery

The central themes of the poem revolve around captivity, freedom, and the power of expression. Through vivid imagery, Dunbar contrasts the freedom of nature with the confinement of the caged bird. The images of the sun, wind, river, and springing grass evoke a sense of beauty and freedom, in stark contrast to the caged bird's restricted existence. The imagery of the bird beating its wings against the bars and singing a "prayer" reflects the longing for freedom and the struggle against oppression. The poem explores the theme of resilience in the face of adversity, as the caged bird continues to sing despite its suffering.

### Literary Devices

Dunbar employs several literary devices to convey the emotions of the caged bird. One significant device is personification, as the bird is given human-like qualities such as feeling pain, longing for freedom, and sending prayers. The repetition of the phrase "I know" emphasizes the speaker's empathy and understanding of the bird's experience. The use of metaphor is also prevalent, with the caged bird symbolizing oppression and the desire for liberation. Additionally, the poem contains alliteration, assonance, and imagery to enhance the emotional impact of the verses.

### Historical and Personal Context

"Sympathy" can be read as a metaphor for the African American experience during this time, with the caged bird representing the struggles and limitations faced by marginalized communities. Dunbar's own experiences as a black man in a racially segregated society likely influenced his portrayal of oppression and resilience in the poem.

### Deep Reading

On a deeper level, "Sympathy" can be interpreted as a commentary on the universal human desire for freedom and self-expression. The caged bird serves as a poignant symbol of any individual or group that is oppressed or constrained, whether physically, socially, or emotionally. The poem invites readers to reflect on their own experiences of limitation and longing for liberation. By capturing the bird's yearning for freedom and its defiance against captivity, Dunbar's poem resonates with audiences across different contexts and time periods, emphasizing the enduring relevance of its themes.

## Lines Written In Early Spring by William Wordsworth

```
I heard a thousand blended notes,
While in a grove I sate reclined,
In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts
Bring sad thoughts to the mind.

To her fair works did Nature link
The human soul that through me ran;
And much it grieved my heart to think
What man has made of man.

Through primrose tufts, in that green bower,
The periwinkle trailed its wreaths;
And 'tis my faith that every flower
Enjoys the air it breathes.

The birds around me hopped and played,
Their thoughts I cannot measure:--
But the least motion which they made
It seemed a thrill of pleasure.

The budding twigs spread out their fan,
To catch the breezy air;
And I must think, do all I can,
That there was pleasure there.

If this belief from heaven be sent,
If such be Nature's holy plan,
Have I not reason to lament
What man has made of man?
```
