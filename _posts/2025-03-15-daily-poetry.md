## The Night is Darkening Around Me by Emily Bronte

```
The night is darkening round me,
The wild winds coldly blow ;
But a tyrant spell has bound me,
And I cannot, cannot go.

The giant trees are bending
Their bare boughs weighed with snow ;
The storm is fast descending,
And yet I cannot go.

Clouds beyond clouds above me,
Wastes beyond wastes below ;
But nothing drear can move me :
I will not, cannot go.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

This poem by Emily Bronte consists of three stanzas, each with four lines. The rhyme scheme is AABB, with each stanza following this pattern. The poem is written in a simple and straightforward structure, which mirrors the speaker's sense of being trapped and unable to escape.

In terms of meter, the poem does not strictly adhere to a specific meter scheme, but it does have a consistent rhythm that adds to the overall melancholic tone. The use of short, concise lines contributes to the sense of urgency and despair felt by the speaker.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem revolves around feelings of entrapment and helplessness. The speaker is surrounded by a dark and foreboding landscape, with the night closing in and the storm approaching. The imagery of the dark night, cold winds, bare trees weighed down with snow, and endless wastelands conveys a sense of desolation and isolation.

The natural imagery in the poem serves to highlight the speaker's emotional state, emphasizing their sense of being trapped and unable to break free. The repeated use of the phrase "I cannot go" reinforces the theme of imprisonment and resignation.

### Literary Devices

Bronte employs several literary devices to enhance the mood and meaning of the poem. The use of personification is evident in lines such as "The giant trees are bending" and "The storm is fast descending," giving human-like qualities to the natural elements and intensifying the sense of impending doom.

The repetition of the phrase "I cannot go" throughout the poem serves as a refrain, emphasizing the speaker's sense of being bound by an unseen force. This repetition adds to the overall feeling of constraint and hopelessness.

### Historical and Personal Context

Emily Bronte, best known for her novel "Wuthering Heights," was a reclusive and introspective writer. The themes of isolation and longing for escape present in this poem reflect Bronte's own inner struggles and the constraints she may have felt in her own life.

The Victorian era, during which Bronte lived, was marked by strict social norms and limitations placed on women. This context adds another layer of meaning to the poem, suggesting a broader commentary on the constraints and limitations imposed by society.

### Deep Reading

On a deeper level, "The Night is Darkening Around Me" can be seen as a reflection of the human condition and the universal experience of feeling trapped or powerless in the face of adversity. The speaker's refusal to move despite the encroaching darkness and storm can be interpreted as a defiant act of resistance against forces beyond their control.

The poem can also be read as a meditation on the inevitability of suffering and the resilience required to endure hardships. The refusal to give in to despair, despite the overwhelming sense of doom, speaks to the strength of the human spirit in the face of adversity.

Overall, "The Night is Darkening Around Me" is a poignant exploration of inner turmoil and the struggle to find a sense of agency in the face of external forces. Bronte's evocative imagery and emotive language create a powerful and haunting portrait of a soul in turmoil.

## A Pæan by Edgar Allan Poe

```
How shall the burial rite be read?
  The solemn song be sung?
The requiem for the loveliest dead,
  That ever died so young?

Her friends are gazing on her,
  And on her gaudy bier,
And weep!--oh! to dishonor
  Dead beauty with a tear!

They loved her for her wealth--
  And they hated her for her pride--
But she grew in feeble health,
  And they _love_ her--that she died.

They tell me (while they speak
  Of her "costly broider'd pall")
That my voice is growing weak--
  That I should not sing at all--

Or that my tone should be
  Tun'd to such solemn song
So mournfully--so mournfully,
  That the dead may feel no wrong.

But she is gone above,
  With young Hope at her side,
And I am drunk with love
  Of the dead, who is my bride.--

Of the dead--dead who lies
  All perfum'd there,
With the death upon her eyes.
  And the life upon her hair.

Thus on the coffin loud and long
  I strike--the murmur sent
Through the gray chambers to my song,
  Shall be the accompaniment.

Thou diedst in thy life's June--
  But thou didst not die too fair:
Thou didst not die too soon,
  Nor with too calm an air.

From more than friends on earth,
  Thy life and love are riven,
To join the untainted mirth
  Of more than thrones in heaven.--

Therefore, to thee this night
  I will no requiem raise,
But waft thee on thy flight,
  With a Pæan of old days.
```

Ultimately, the poem serves as a poignant exploration of the complexities of grief and the enduring power of love beyond death.

## Is it Well with the Child? by Christina Rossetti

```
SAFE where I cannot die yet,
   Safe where I hope to lie too,
Safe from the fume and the fret;
   You, and you,

Safe from the frost and the snow,
   Safe from the storm and the sun,
Safe where the seeds wait to grow
   One by one,
   And to come back in blow.
