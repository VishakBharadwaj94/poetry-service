## Trees by Joyce Kilmer

```
(For Mrs. Henry Mills Alden)

I think that I shall never see
A poem lovely as a tree.
A tree whose hungry mouth is prest
Against the earth's sweet flowing breast;
A tree that looks at God all day,
And lifts her leafy arms to pray;
A tree that may in Summer wear
A nest of robins in her hair;
Upon whose bosom snow has lain;
Who intimately lives with rain.
Poems are made by fools like me,
But only God can make a tree.
```

### Analysis

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "Trees" by Joyce Kilmer consists of twelve lines divided into three quatrains. Each quatrain follows an ABAB rhyme scheme, with a regular rhythm and meter. The poem's structure is simple yet effective, with a consistent rhyme scheme that enhances the musicality of the verses. The meter is predominantly iambic tetrameter, with lines alternating between eight and nine syllables, contributing to the poem's flowing and lyrical quality.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem revolves around the beauty and majesty of nature, specifically trees. Kilmer celebrates the tree as a symbol of divine creation and perfection, contrasting it with the flawed creations of human beings. The imagery employed throughout the poem is vivid and evocative, painting a picture of a tree as a living, breathing entity that is in constant communion with nature and the divine. The imagery of the tree's "leafy arms" lifted in prayer and its ability to host a "nest of robins" showcases the tree as a nurturing and sacred presence in the natural world.

### Literary Devices

Kilmer employs several literary devices in "Trees" to enhance the poem's impact. One prominent device is personification, ascribing human qualities to the tree by describing its "hungry mouth" and its ability to "look at God all day" and "pray" with its leafy arms. The use of personification serves to elevate the tree to a spiritual and almost sentient being, emphasizing its connection to the divine. Additionally, the repetition of the word "tree" throughout the poem serves as an anaphora, reinforcing the central focus of the poem and highlighting the importance of the tree as a subject.

### Historical and Personal Context

Written in 1913, during a time of increasing industrialization and urbanization, "Trees" can be seen as a reaction to the loss of natural beauty and the encroachment of human development on the environment. Kilmer's admiration for the simplicity and purity of nature reflects a nostalgic longing for a more harmonious relationship between humanity and the natural world. The dedication to Mrs. Henry Mills Alden suggests a personal connection or admiration for her, adding a touch of intimacy to the poem.

### Deep Reading

At its core, "Trees" can be read as a meditation on the beauty and perfection of God's creation in contrast to the imperfections of human creation. Kilmer humbly acknowledges the limitations of human artistry in comparison to the divine artistry manifested in the creation of a tree. The poem serves as a reminder of the power and majesty of nature, urging readers to appreciate and respect the natural world. Ultimately, "Trees" invites contemplation on the profound connection between the physical and the spiritual realms, highlighting the tree as a tangible symbol of this divine connection.

## Heaven by Rupert Brooke

```
Fish (fly-replete, in depth of June,
Dawdling away their wat'ry noon)
Ponder deep wisdom, dark or clear,
Each secret fishy hope or fear.
Fish say, they have their Stream and Pond;
But is there anything Beyond?
This life cannot be All, they swear,
For how unpleasant, if it were!
One may not doubt that, somehow, Good
Shall come of Water and of Mud;
And, sure, the reverent eye must see
A Purpose in Liquidity.
We darkly know, by Faith we cry,
The future is not Wholly Dry.
Mud unto mud!—Death eddies near—
Not here the appointed End, not here!
But somewhere, beyond Space and Time,
Is wetter water, slimier slime!
And there (they trust) there swimmeth One
Who swam ere rivers were begun,
Immense, of fishy form and mind,
Squamous, omnipotent, and kind;
And under that Almighty Fin,
The littlest fish may enter in.
Oh! never fly conceals a hook,
Fish say, in the Eternal Brook,
But more than mundane weeds are there,
And mud, celestially fair;
Fat caterpillars drift around,
And Paradisal grubs are found;
Unfading moths, immortal flies,
And the worm that never dies.
And in that heaven of all their wish,
There shall be no more land, say fish.
```

### Analysis

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

Rupert Brooke's poem "Heaven" is written in free verse, lacking a consistent rhyme scheme or meter. The poem consists of a single stanza with varying line lengths, contributing to its conversational and contemplative tone. The lack of a strict structure mirrors the introspective musings of the fish in the poem, allowing for a more fluid exploration of existential themes.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem revolves around the concept of heaven and the afterlife, as seen from the perspective of fish. The fish ponder the idea of existence beyond their familiar Stream and Pond, questioning whether there is something more beyond their current reality. This exploration of the unknown and the afterlife is presented through vivid aquatic imagery, with references to water, mud, and aquatic creatures like fish, caterpillars, and moths. The imagery of the Eternal Brook and celestial mud creates a mystical and ethereal atmosphere, inviting readers to contemplate the nature of existence and the possibility of a divine realm.

### Literary Devices

Brooke employs various literary devices to convey the existential musings of the fish. The personification of the fish, who ponder deep wisdom and express hope and fear, adds a human-like quality to these aquatic creatures, allowing them to grapple with complex philosophical questions. The use of alliteration, as seen in phrases like "Fish (fly-replete, in depth of June)" and "Mud unto mud!—Death eddies near," creates a rhythmic and musical quality to the poem, enhancing its lyrical appeal. Additionally, the repetition of the word "here" in the lines "Not here the appointed End, not here!" emphasizes the fish's belief in a realm beyond their current existence.

### Historical and Personal Context

Rupert Brooke was a British poet known for his idealistic and patriotic poetry, particularly during World War I. While "Heaven" does not directly address war or nationalism, it reflects Brooke's fascination with themes of mortality and the afterlife. Written in the early 20th century, during a time of great uncertainty and upheaval, the poem captures a sense of longing for transcendence and spiritual fulfillment amidst the chaos of the modern world.

### Deep Reading

At its core, "Heaven" can be interpreted as a meditation on the human desire for meaning and transcendence. By presenting the existential questions of the fish, Brooke invites readers to reflect on their own beliefs about life, death, and the unknown. The fish's speculation about a divine realm beyond their earthly existence serves as a metaphor for the universal human search for purpose and a higher power. Through its imaginative imagery and philosophical inquiry, the poem prompts readers to consider the mysteries of existence and the possibility of a spiritual dimension beyond the tangible world.

## She Dotes by Edward Thomas

```
SHE dotes on what the wild birds say
Or hint or mock at, night and day,--
Thrush, blackbird, all that sing in May,
      And songless plover,
Hawk, heron, owl, and woodpecker.
They never say a word to her
      About her lover.

She laughs at them for childishness,
She cries at them for carelessness
Who see her going loverless
      Yet sing and chatter
Just as when he was not a ghost,
Nor ever ask her what she has lost
      Or what is the matter.

Yet she has fancied blackbirds hide
A secret, and that thrushes chide
Because she thinks death can divide
      Her from her lover;
And she has slept, trying to translate
The word the cuckoo cries to his mate
      Over and over.
```

### Themes and Imagery

### Literary Devices

Thomas employs various literary devices in the poem to convey the protagonist's emotions and the theme of unrequited love. Personification is evident in the portrayal of the birds as mocking or indifferent to the protagonist's feelings.

Imagery is also used effectively to evoke the protagonist's sense of isolation and longing for her lover.

### Historical and Personal Context

Edward Thomas was a British poet who wrote during the early 20th century, a time marked by social and cultural changes. The theme of unrequited love and nature's indifference to human suffering reflects the broader existential concerns of the modernist era.
