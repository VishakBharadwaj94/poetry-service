## Later life by Christina Rossetti

```
Something this foggy day, a something which
Is neither of this fog nor of today,
Has set me dreaming of the winds that play
Past certain cliffs, along one certain beach,
And turn the topmost edge of waves to spray:
Ah pleasant pebbly strand so far away,
So out of reach while quite within my reach,
As out of reach as India or Cathay!
I am sick of where I am and where I am not,
I am sick of foresight and of memory,
I am sick of all I have and all I see,
I am sick of self, and there is nothing new;
Oh weary impatient patience of my lot!
Thus with myself: how fares it, Friends, with you?
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

In terms of form, "Later Life" by Christina Rossetti is a sonnet, consisting of fourteen lines. The poem follows the traditional Petrarchan or Italian sonnet form, with an octave (the first eight lines) followed by a sestet (the final six lines). The rhyme scheme is ABBAABBA for the octave, and CDDCEE for the sestet. This structured form allows Rossetti to explore her feelings of discontent and longing within a controlled framework.

In addition to the sonnet form, the poem's meter is predominantly iambic pentameter, with each line containing five pairs of syllables. This regular meter gives the poem a sense of rhythm and flow, enhancing the contemplative mood of the speaker as she reflects on her dissatisfaction with her current circumstances.

### Themes and Imagery

The central themes in "Later Life" revolve around longing, dissatisfaction, and introspection. The speaker expresses a deep sense of discontent with her present situation and a yearning for something beyond her reach. The imagery of "certain cliffs" and "one certain beach" evokes a specific place that holds sentimental value for the speaker, symbolizing a longing for a different time or a different life. The use of the fog as a metaphor for the speaker's confusion and uncertainty further emphasizes the theme of feeling lost and disconnected.

The imagery of the "pleasant pebbly strand" that is "out of reach while quite within my reach" conveys a sense of paradox and frustration, highlighting the speaker's internal conflict between desire and reality. The mention of India and Cathay as distant, unreachable lands serves to underscore the speaker's feelings of restlessness and dissatisfaction with her current circumstances.

### Literary Devices

Rossetti employs several literary devices in "Later Life" to enhance the poem's meaning and emotional impact. One notable device is the use of enjambment, where sentences and thoughts continue from one line to the next without punctuation. This technique creates a sense of fluidity and movement in the poem, mirroring the speaker's wandering thoughts and emotions.

The poem also features imagery, such as the fog, cliffs, beach, and waves, which serve as powerful symbols of the speaker's inner turmoil and longing. The repetition of the word "sick" throughout the poem conveys the speaker's overwhelming sense of dissatisfaction and weariness with her current state of being.

Additionally, the use of rhetorical questions in the final lines, "how fares it, Friends, with you?" invites the reader to reflect on their own feelings and experiences, creating a sense of shared introspection and contemplation.

### Historical and Personal Context

Christina Rossetti was a Victorian poet known for her introspective and often melancholic verse. As a devout Christian, many of her poems explore themes of faith, love, and mortality. "Later Life" reflects Rossetti's own struggles with illness and personal dissatisfaction, as well as her desire for spiritual fulfillment and peace.

During the Victorian era, there was a growing sense of disillusionment with traditional values and an increasing focus on individual experiences and emotions. Rossetti's poem captures this sense of inner turmoil and longing for something beyond the mundane realities of daily life, resonating with the broader cultural shifts of the time.

### Deep Reading

At its core, "Later Life" can be seen as a meditation on the universal human experience of discontent and longing. The speaker's introspective reflections on her dissatisfaction with her current circumstances and her yearning for something beyond her reach speak to the timeless struggle for meaning and fulfillment.

The juxtaposition of the tangible imagery of cliffs and beaches with the intangible emotions of longing and restlessness creates a sense of tension and paradox that encapsulates the speaker's conflicted feelings. Ultimately, the poem invites readers to reflect on their own desires, regrets, and aspirations, prompting a deeper consideration of the nature of discontent and the search for fulfillment in life.

## The New School by Joyce Kilmer

```
(For My Mother)

The halls that were loud with the merry tread of
young and careless feet
Are still with a stillness that is too drear to seem like holiday,
And never a gust of laughter breaks the calm of the dreaming street
Or rises to shake the ivied walls and frighten the doves away.
The dust is on book and on empty desk, and the
tennis-racquet and balls
Lie still in their lonely locker and wait for a game that is never
played,
And over the study and lecture-room and the river and meadow falls
A stern peace, a strange peace, a peace that War has made.
For many a youthful shoulder now is gay with an
epaulet,
And the hand that was deft with a cricket-bat is defter with a sword,
And some of the lads will laugh to-day where the trench is red and
wet,
And some will win on the bloody field the accolade of the Lord.
They have taken their youth and mirth away
from the study and playing-ground
To a new school in an alien land beneath an alien sky;
Out in the smoke and roar of the fight their lessons and games are
found,
And they who were learning how to live are learning how to die.
And after the golden day has come and the war is
at an end,
A slab of bronze on the chapel wall will tell of the noble dead.
And every name on that radiant list will be the name of a friend,
A name that shall through the centuries in grateful prayers be said.
And there will be ghosts in the old school,
brave ghosts with laughing eyes,
On the field with a ghostly cricket-bat, by the stream with a ghostly
rod;
They will touch the hearts of the living with a flame that sanctifies,
A flame that they took with strong young hands
from the altar-fires of God.
```

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem is the impact of war on young students who are forced to leave behind their carefree school days to enter the harsh reality of battle. The imagery used in the poem vividly captures the contrast between the once lively school environment and the somber, desolate atmosphere that now prevails. The poet describes the halls as being "still with a stillness that is too drear to seem like holiday," emphasizing the absence of joy and laughter that once filled the school. The imagery of dusty books and abandoned sports equipment further reinforces the idea of a place that has been deserted and transformed by the ravages of war.

### Literary Devices

Kilmer employs various literary devices to convey the emotional impact of war on the young students. One such device is personification, as seen in the lines "And some will win on the bloody field the accolade of the Lord," where war is personified as a force that bestows honor upon those who fight in it. The use of simile is also evident in the line "A flame that they took with strong young hands from the altar-fires of God," comparing the courage and sacrifice of the students to a sacred flame.

### Historical and Personal Context

Joyce Kilmer wrote this poem during World War I, a time of great upheaval and loss. The poem reflects the personal experiences of Kilmer himself, who served as a soldier in the war and witnessed firsthand the impact it had on young men. The reference to epaulets and swords highlights the shift from peaceful pursuits like cricket to the harsh reality of battle that many young men faced during this time.

### Deep Reading

Through "The New School," Kilmer not only pays tribute to the sacrifices made by young soldiers but also explores the enduring legacy of those who have fallen in war. The image of "ghosts in the old school" suggests that the memory of these brave individuals will continue to inspire and guide future generations. The poem conveys a sense of reverence for those who have given their lives in service of their country, as well as a reminder of the profound impact of war on youth and innocence. Kilmer's use of poignant imagery and heartfelt language serves to honor the memory of the fallen while also prompting readers to reflect on the cost of conflict.
