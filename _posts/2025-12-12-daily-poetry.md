## Her Sweet turn to leave the Homestead by Emily Dickinson

```
Her Sweet turn to leave the Homestead
Came the Darker Way --
Carriages -- Be Sure -- and Guests -- too --
But for Holiday

'Tis more pitiful Endeavor
Than did Loaded Sea
O'er the Curls attempt to caper
It had cast away --

Never Bride had such Assembling --
Never kinsmen kneeled
To salute so fair a Forehead --
Garland be indeed --

Fitter Feet -- of Her before us --
Than whatever Brow
Art of Snow -- or Trick of Lily
Possibly bestow

Of Her Father -- Whoso ask Her --
He shall seek as high
As the Palm -- that serve the Desert --
To obtain the Sky --

Distance -- be Her only Motion --
If 'tis Nay -- or Yes --
Acquiescence -- or Demurral --
Whosoever guess --

He -- must pass the Crystal Angle
That obscure Her face --
He -- must have achieved in person
Equal Paradise --
```

## To---- by Edgar Allan Poe

```
I heed not that my earthly lot
  Hath--little of Earth in it--
That years of love have been forgot
  In the hatred of a minute:--
I mourn not that the desolate
  Are happier, sweet, than I,
But that _you_ sorrow for _my_ fate
  Who am a passer-by.

## Lines Written In Early Spring by William Wordsworth

```
I heard a thousand blended notes,
While in a grove I sate reclined,
In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts
Bring sad thoughts to the mind.

To her fair works did Nature link
The human soul that through me ran;
And much it grieved my heart to think
What man has made of man.

Through primrose tufts, in that green bower,
The periwinkle trailed its wreaths;
And 'tis my faith that every flower
Enjoys the air it breathes.

The birds around me hopped and played,
Their thoughts I cannot measure:--
But the least motion which they made
It seemed a thrill of pleasure.

The budding twigs spread out their fan,
To catch the breezy air;
And I must think, do all I can,
That there was pleasure there.

If this belief from heaven be sent,
If such be Nature's holy plan,
Have I not reason to lament
What man has made of man?
```

The speaker reflects on the harmony and joy present in nature, contrasting it with the discord and suffering caused by human actions.

### Literary Devices

Wordsworth employs several literary devices in the poem, including personification, imagery, and rhetorical questions.

### Word Suggestions

Consider these word pairs that complement your poem's tone:

- **blee** (Germanic) / **colour** (Latinate)
  - *The word 'blee' has a more archaic and poetic feel, evoking a sense of nostalgia and old-fashioned charm. 'Colour', on the other hand, is more commonly used and straightforward, lacking the same emotional depth. In this context, 'blee' would better suit the tone of the poem, adding a touch of whimsy and uniqueness.*
  - **Recommended:** Use the germanic version to enhance your poem's tone

- **water** (Germanic) / **aqueous** (Latinate)
  - *'Water' is a simple and universal word that conveys a sense of clarity and purity. 'Aqueous', on the other hand, is more scientific and formal, lacking the emotional resonance needed for a poem about lost love and fading memories. Therefore, 'water' would be more appropriate to convey the desired tone and evoke the right emotions.*
  - **Recommended:** Use the germanic version to enhance your poem's tone

- **see** (Germanic) / **perceive** (Latinate)
  - *'See' is a straightforward and common verb that implies a direct visual experience. 'Perceive', on the other hand, carries a deeper connotation of understanding or sensing something beyond the physical. In the context of exploring bittersweet memories and echoes of laughter, 'perceive' adds a layer of introspection and emotional depth that 'see' may lack, making it the recommended choice for this poem's tone.*
  - **Recommended:** Use the latinate version to enhance your poem's tone
