## The Summer that we did not prize, by Emily Dickinson

```
The Summer that we did not prize,
Her treasures were so easy
Instructs us by departing now
And recognition lazy --

Bestirs itself -- puts on its Coat,
And scans with fatal promptness
For Trains that moment out of sight,
Unconscious of his smartness.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

This poem by Emily Dickinson consists of four quatrains, with each stanza following an ABAB rhyme scheme. The meter is irregular, as is common in Dickinson's poetry, but there is a sense of rhythmic flow in the lines. The poem's structure is simple yet effective, with each stanza building upon the previous one to convey a clear message.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem revolves around the idea of appreciating what we have before it is gone. The speaker reflects on a summer that was not fully appreciated at the time, only to realize its value once it has passed. The imagery of the treasures of summer being "easy" to come by highlights the idea that we often take things for granted until they are no longer within our grasp.

### Literary Devices

Dickinson employs several literary devices in this poem to convey her message effectively. One such device is personification, as she personifies recognition as lazy and bestirs itself. This personification adds depth to the poem and helps to illustrate the idea of realizing the value of something only after it is gone. Additionally, the use of imagery, such as the metaphor of recognition putting on its coat and scanning for trains out of sight, creates a vivid picture in the reader's mind.

### Historical and Personal Context

Emily Dickinson lived during the 19th century, a time marked by significant social and cultural changes. Her poetry often reflects the themes of loss, death, and the fleeting nature of life. In this poem, Dickinson captures the essence of nostalgia and the regret that comes with not fully appreciating something until it is too late. This theme resonates with readers across different time periods and continues to be relevant today.

### Deep Reading

On a deeper level, this poem can be seen as a reflection on the human tendency to overlook the beauty and value of the present moment. The speaker's realization of the summer's worth after it has passed serves as a reminder to cherish what we have while we have it. The poem urges readers to be more mindful of the fleeting nature of time and to savor each moment before it becomes a memory. Dickinson's poignant reflection on the summer that was not prized invites us to consider our own attitudes towards the present and the importance of living in the moment.

## The Cathedral of Rheims by Joyce Kilmer

```
(From the French of Emile Verhaeren)

He who walks through the meadows of Champagne
At noon in Fall, when leaves like gold appear,
Sees it draw near
Like some great mountain set upon the plain,
From radiant dawn until the close of day,
Nearer it grows
To him who goes
Across the country.  When tall towers lay
Their shadowy pall
Upon his way,
He enters, where
The solid stone is hollowed deep by all
Its centuries of beauty and of prayer.
Ancient French temple! thou whose hundred kings
Watch over thee, emblazoned on thy walls,
Tell me, within thy memory-hallowed halls
What chant of triumph, or what war-song rings?
Thou hast known Clovis and his Frankish train,
Whose mighty hand Saint Remy's hand did keep
And in thy spacious vault perhaps may sleep
An echo of the voice of Charlemagne.
For God thou has known fear, when from His side
Men wandered, seeking alien shrines and new,
But still the sky was bountiful and blue
And thou wast crowned with France's love and pride.
Sacred thou art, from pinnacle to base;
And in thy panes of gold and scarlet glass
The setting sun sees thousandfold his face;
Sorrow and joy, in stately silence pass
Across thy walls, the shadow and the light;
Around thy lofty pillars, tapers white
Illuminate, with delicate sharp flames,
The brows of saints with venerable names,
And in the night erect a fiery wall.
A great but silent fervour burns in all
Those simple folk who kneel, pathetic, dumb,
And know that down below, beside the Rhine --
Cannon, horses, soldiers, flags in line --
With blare of trumpets, mighty armies come.
Suddenly, each knows fear;
Swift rumours pass, that every one must hear,
The hostile banners blaze against the sky
And by the embassies mobs rage and cry.
Now war has come, and peace is at an end.
On Paris town the German troops descend.
They are turned back, and driven to Champagne.
And now, as to so many weary men,
The glorious temple gives them welcome, when
It meets them at the bottom of the plain.
At once, they set their cannon in its way.
There is no gable now, nor wall
That does not suffer, night and day,
As shot and shell in crushing torrents fall.
The stricken tocsin quivers through the tower;
The triple nave, the apse, the lonely choir
Are circled, hour by hour,
With thundering bands of fire
And Death is scattered broadcast among men.
And then
That which was splendid with baptismal grace;
The stately arches soaring into space,
The transepts, columns, windows gray and gold,
The organ, in whose tones the ocean rolled,
The crypts, of mighty shades the dwelling places,
The Virgin's gentle hands, the Saints' pure faces,
All, even the pardoning hands of Christ the Lord
Were struck and broken by the wanton sword
Of sacrilegious lust.
O beauty slain, O glory in the dust!
Strong walls of faith, most basely overthrown!
The crawling flames, like adders glistening
Ate the white fabric of this lovely thing.
Now from its soul arose a piteous moan,
The soul that always loved the just and fair.
Granite and marble loud their woe confessed,
The silver monstrances that Popes had blessed,
The chalices and lamps and crosiers rare
Were seared and twisted by a flaming breath;
The horror everywhere did range and swell,
The guardian Saints into this furnace fell,
Their bitter tears and screams were stilled in death.
Around the flames armed hosts are skirmishing,
The burning sun reflects the lurid scene;
The German army, fighting for its life,
Rallies its torn and terrified left wing;
And, as they near this place
The imperial eagles see
Before them in their flight,
Here, in the solemn night,
The old cathedral, to the years to be
Showing, with wounded arms, their own disgrace.
```
