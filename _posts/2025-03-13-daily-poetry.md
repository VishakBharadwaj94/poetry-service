## The Buried Life by Matthew Arnold

```
Light flows our war of mocking words, and yet,
Behold, with tears mine eyes are wet!
I feel a nameless sadness o'er me roll.
Yes, yes, we know that we can jest,
We know, we know that we can smile!
But there's a something in this breast,
To which thy light words bring no rest,
And thy gay smiles no anodyne.
Give me thy hand, and hush awhile,
And turn those limpid eyes on mine,
And let me read there, love! thy inmost soul.

Alas! is even love too weak
To unlock the heart, and let it speak?
Are even lovers powerless to reveal
To one another what indeed they feel?
I knew the mass of men conceal'd
Their thoughts, for fear that if reveal'd
They would by other men be met
With blank indifference, or with blame reproved;
I knew they lived and moved
Trick'd in disguises, alien to the rest
Of men, and alien to themselves--and yet
The same heart beats in every human breast!

But we, my love!--doth a like spell benumb
Our hearts, our voices?--must we too be dumb?

Ah! well for us, if even we,
Even for a moment, can get free
Our heart, and have our lips unchain'd;
For that which seals them hath been deep-ordain'd!

Fate, which foresaw
How frivolous a baby man would be--
By what distractions he would be possess'd,
How he would pour himself in every strife,
And well-nigh change his own identity--
That it might keep from his capricious play
His genuine self, and force him to obey
Even in his own despite his being's law,
Bade through the deep recesses of our breast
The unregarded river of our life
Pursue with indiscernible flow its way;
And that we should not see
The buried stream, and seem to be
Eddying at large in blind uncertainty,
Though driving on with it eternally.

But often, in the world's most crowded streets,
But often, in the din of strife,
There rises an unspeakable desire
After the knowledge of our buried life;
A thirst to spend our fire and restless force
In tracking out our true, original course;
A longing to inquire
Into the mystery of this heart which beats
So wild, so deep in us--to know
Whence our lives come and where they go.
And many a man in his own breast then delves,
But deep enough, alas! none ever mines.
And we have been on many thousand lines,
And we have shown, on each, spirit and power;
But hardly have we, for one little hour,
Been on our own line, have we been ourselves--
Hardly had skill to utter one of all
The nameless feelings that course through our breast,
But they course on for ever unexpress'd.
And long we try in vain to speak and act
Our hidden self, and what we say and do
Is eloquent, is well--but 't#is not true!
And then we will no more be rack'd
With inward striving, and demand
Of all the thousand nothings of the hour
Their stupefying power;
Ah yes, and they benumb us at our call!
Yet still, from time to time, vague and forlorn,
From the soul's subterranean depth upborne
As from an infinitely distant land,
Come airs, and floating echoes, and convey
A melancholy into all our day.
Only--but this is rare--
When a belov{'e}d hand is laid in ours,
When, jaded with the rush and glare
Of the interminable hours,
Our eyes can in another's eyes read clear,
When our world-deafen'd ear
Is by the tones of a loved voice caress'd--
A bolt is shot back somewhere in our breast,
And a lost pulse of feeling stirs again.
The eye sinks inward, and the heart lies plain,
And what we mean, we say, and what we would, we know.
A man becomes aware of his life's flow,
And hears its winding murmur; and he sees
The meadows where it glides, the sun, the breeze.

And there arrives a lull in the hot race
Wherein he doth for ever chase
That flying and elusive shadow, rest.
An air of coolness plays upon his face,
And an unwonted calm pervades his breast.
And then he thinks he knows
The hills where his life rose,
And the sea where it goes.
```

The imagery of crowded streets and din of strife reflects the chaos and noise of daily life that can drown out the voice of our true selves.

### Literary Devices
Arnold employs various literary devices in the poem to convey its themes effectively. The use of personification is evident in lines such as "Fate, which foresaw / How frivolous a baby man would be," giving human qualities to abstract concepts. The repetition of phrases like "But we, my love!" and "And long we try in vain" creates a rhythmic pattern that emphasizes the recurring struggle to uncover one's buried life.

## Sonnet: I said I splendidly loved you; it's not true by Rupert Brooke

```
I said I splendidly loved you; it's not true.
Such long swift tides stir not a land-locked sea.
On gods or fools the high risk falls -- on you --
The clean clear bitter-sweet that's not for me.
Love soars from earth to ecstasies unwist.
Love is flung Lucifer-like from Heaven to Hell.
But -- there are wanderers in the middle mist,
Who cry for shadows, clutch, and cannot tell
Whether they love at all, or, loving, whom:
An old song's lady, a fool in fancy dress,
Or phantoms, or their own face on the gloom;
For love of Love, or from heart's loneliness.
Pleasure's not theirs, nor pain. They doubt, and sigh,
And do not love at all. Of these am I.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

This sonnet follows the typical structure of 14 lines with a rhyme scheme of ABABCDCDEFEFGG. The meter is predominantly iambic pentameter, with five stressed syllables in each line. The consistent rhyme scheme and meter give the poem a formal and organized feel, reflecting the traditional nature of sonnets.

### Themes and Imagery

The poem explores the complexities of love and the idea that love is not always straightforward or easy to define. The speaker admits that their professed love is not genuine, highlighting the struggle to truly understand their own feelings. The imagery of "long swift tides stir not a land-locked sea" conveys the idea of love as a powerful force that cannot reach someone who is closed off or unable to reciprocate. The references to gods, fools, Lucifer, and shadows evoke a sense of divine, chaotic, and mysterious aspects of love, emphasizing its unpredictable and sometimes destructive nature.

### Literary Devices

Brooke employs various literary devices throughout the poem to enhance its meaning. The use of alliteration in "clean clear bitter-sweet" creates a sense of contrast and complexity in the emotions of love. The metaphor of love as a journey through different realms, from earth to Heaven to Hell, adds depth to the exploration of love's highs and lows. The comparison of the speaker to "wanderers in the middle mist" captures the uncertainty and confusion that can accompany feelings of love.

### Historical and Personal Context

Rupert Brooke was a prominent poet during World War I, known for his idealistic and patriotic verse. This sonnet, however, delves into a more personal and introspective exploration of love and its complexities. It reflects the broader themes of disillusionment and uncertainty that were prevalent in the aftermath of the war, as individuals grappled with the realities of loss and change.

### Deep Reading

At its core, this poem delves into the internal turmoil and doubt that can accompany feelings of love. The speaker grapples with their own uncertainties and insecurities, questioning the authenticity of their emotions and struggling to make sense of their desires. The references to "an old song's lady" and "phantoms" suggest a yearning for a love that may be unattainable or illusory. Ultimately, the speaker acknowledges their own emotional distance and inability to fully embrace love, leading to a sense of isolation and longing. Through vivid imagery and introspective reflection, Brooke captures the complexities and contradictions inherent in the experience of love.

## At Home by Christina Rossetti

```
When I was dead, my spirit turned
To seek the much-frequented house:
I passed the door, and saw my friends
Feasting beneath green orange boughs;
From hand to hand they pushed the wine,
They sucked the pulp of plum and peach;
They sang, they jested, and they laughed,
For each was loved of each.

I listened to thier honest chat:
Said one: "To-morrow we shall be
Plod plod along the featureless sands,
And coasting miles and miles of sea."
Said one: "Before the turn of tide
We will achieve the eyrie-seat."
Said one: "To-morrow shall be like
To-day, but much more sweet."

"To-morrow," said they, strong with hope,
And dwelt upon the pleasant way:
"To-morrow," cried they, one and all,
While no one spoke of yesterday.
Their life stood full at blessed noon;
I, only I, had passed away:
"To-morrow and to-day," they cried;
I was of yesterday.

I shivered comfortless, but cast
No chill across the table-cloth;
I, all-forgotten, shivered, sad
To stay, and yet to part how loth:
I passed from the familiar room,
I who from love had passed away,
Like the remembrance of a guest
That tarrieth but a day.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

Christina Rossetti's poem "At Home" consists of four stanzas, each with a varying number of lines and a consistent rhyme scheme of ABAB.

The meter of the poem is mostly iambic tetrameter, with lines alternating between four stressed and four unstressed syllables, creating a rhythmic flow that propels the narrative forward. The rhyme scheme adds a musical quality to the poem while also emphasizing the contrast between the speaker's past and present.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of "At Home" revolves around the idea of isolation and alienation. The speaker, who is dead but still able to observe the living, feels a deep sense of longing and sorrow as they witness their friends enjoying each other's company without them. The imagery of a lively gathering beneath green orange boughs, with friends feasting and laughing, contrasts sharply with the speaker's cold and lonely existence. The repeated references to tomorrow highlight the passage of time and the inevitability of change, further emphasizing the speaker's sense of being left behind.

### Literary Devices

Rossetti employs various literary devices to enhance the emotional impact of the poem. The use of personification is evident in lines such as "my spirit turned" and "I passed from the familiar room," giving human qualities to abstract concepts like death and memory. The contrast between the vibrant imagery of the feast and the speaker's cold detachment creates a powerful juxtaposition that underscores the theme of separation. Additionally, the repetition of the word "To-morrow" serves to emphasize the fleeting nature of time and the inevitability of change.

### Historical and Personal Context

Christina Rossetti was a Victorian poet known for her introspective and melancholic themes, often drawing on her own experiences of loss and isolation. "At Home" reflects Rossetti's preoccupation with mortality and the transient nature of human relationships, themes that were prevalent in the Victorian era. The poem can also be interpreted as a commentary on the societal expectations placed on women during that time, as the speaker's sense of isolation may be a metaphor for the limitations imposed on women in terms of social roles and relationships.

### Deep Reading

"At Home" can be seen as a meditation on the passage of time and the inevitability of change. The speaker's poignant observation of their friends' carefree enjoyment of life highlights the bittersweet nature of memory and nostalgia. The poem evokes a sense of longing and regret, as the speaker grapples with the idea of being forgotten and left behind. Ultimately, "At Home" speaks to the universal experience of feeling disconnected from the world around us, even as life continues to move forward without us.
