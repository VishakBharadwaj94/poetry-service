## Porphyria's Lover by Robert Browning

```
The rain set early in to-night,
        The sullen wind was soon awake,
It tore the elm-tops down for spite,
        And did its worst to vex the lake:
        I listened with heart fit to break.
When glided in Porphyria; straight
        She shut the cold out and the storm,
And kneeled and made the cheerless grate
        Blaze up, and all the cottage warm;
        Which done, she rose, and from her form
Withdrew the dripping cloak and shawl,
        And laid her soiled gloves by, untied
Her hat and let the damp hair fall,
        And, last, she sat down by my side
        And called me. When no voice replied,
She put my arm about her waist,
        And made her smooth white shoulder bare,
And all her yellow hair displaced,
        And, stooping, made my cheek lie there,
        And spread, o'er all, her yellow hair,
Murmuring how she loved me--she
        Too weak, for all her heart's endeavour,
To set its struggling passion free
        From pride, and vainer ties dissever,
        And give herself to me for ever.
But passion sometimes would prevail,
        Nor could to-night's gay feast restrain
A sudden thought of one so pale
        For love of her, and all in vain:
        So, she was come through wind and rain.

Be sure I looked up at her eyes
        Happy and proud; at last I knew
Porphyria worshipped me; surprise
        Made my heart swell, and still it grew
        While I debated what to do.
That moment she was mine, mine, fair,
        Perfectly pure and good: I found
A thing to do, and all her hair
        In one long yellow string I wound
        Three times her little throat around,
And strangled her.  No pain felt she;
        I am quite sure she felt no pain.
As a shut bud that holds a bee,
        I warily oped her lids: again
        Laughed the blue eyes without a stain.
And I untightened next the tress
        About her neck; her cheek once more
Blushed bright beneath my burning kiss:
        I propped her head up as before,
        Only, this time my shoulder bore
Her head, which droops upon it still:
        The smiling rosy little head,
So glad it has its utmost will,
        That all it scorned at once is fled,
And I, its love, am gained instead!
Porphyria's love: she guessed not how
        Her darling one wish would be heard.
And thus we sit together now,
        And all night long we have not stirred,
        And yet God has not said a word!
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

"Porphyria's Lover" by Robert Browning is a dramatic monologue, a form of poetry where a single speaker addresses a silent listener, allowing the reader to gain insight into the speaker's thoughts and feelings. The poem consists of 60 lines divided into rhyming couplets, with an ABABB rhyme scheme. The regular rhyme scheme and consistent meter contribute to the poem's musical quality and make it easy to follow.

The meter of the poem is predominantly iambic tetrameter, with four metrical feet per line. This regularity in meter helps to create a sense of control and order in contrast to the disturbing events described in the poem. The structure of the poem, with its gradual build-up of tension and the abrupt climax, mirrors the speaker's escalating emotions and actions.

### Themes and Imagery

One of the central themes of "Porphyria's Lover" is the destructive nature of obsessive love. The speaker's intense passion for Porphyria leads him to commit a heinous act of violence in an attempt to possess her completely. The contrast between the stormy weather outside and the cozy domestic scene inside the cottage serves as a backdrop to the speaker's inner turmoil and descent into madness.

Imagery plays a crucial role in conveying the themes of the poem. The stormy weather symbolizes the chaos and turmoil within the speaker's mind, while Porphyria's actions of lighting the fire and undressing suggest a desire for warmth and intimacy. The image of Porphyria's hair being wound around her neck and the act of strangulation evoke a sense of suffocation and control, highlighting the speaker's possessiveness and fixation on maintaining power over Porphyria.

### Literary Devices

Browning employs several literary devices in "Porphyria's Lover" to enhance the poem's impact. One notable device is enjambment, where sentences and phrases run over multiple lines, creating a sense of continuity and building tension. For example, in the lines "And stooping, made my cheek lie there, / And spread, o'er all, her yellow hair," the enjambment emphasizes the intimacy of the moment.

The poem also features imagery, symbolism, and irony. The act of strangling Porphyria with her own hair can be seen as a symbol of the speaker's desire to possess and control her completely. Additionally, the ironic tone of the poem, where the speaker believes he has done a loving act by killing Porphyria, adds depth to the narrative and invites readers to question the speaker's morality and sanity.

### Historical and Personal Context

Robert Browning wrote "Porphyria's Lover" during the Victorian era, a time characterized by strict social norms and expectations regarding love and relationships. The poem challenges these conventions by depicting a love that is possessive, obsessive, and ultimately destructive. Browning's exploration of the darker aspects of human nature reflects the anxieties and uncertainties of the era.

The poem can also be viewed in the context of Browning's own life and relationships. Browning's own marriage to Elizabeth Barrett Browning was unconventional and marked by deep emotional connection. It is possible that Browning used the dramatic monologue form to explore themes of love, power, and control that resonated with his personal experiences.

### Deep Reading

At its core, "Porphyria's Lover" delves into the complexities of human emotions and the destructive consequences of unchecked passion. The speaker's delusion of love and his belief that he is acting out of love by committing a violent act reveal the distorted nature of his feelings. The poem challenges the reader to confront uncomfortable truths about the darker side of love and the potential for obsession to lead to tragedy.

The ambiguous ending, where the speaker and Porphyria sit together without moving, suggests a frozen moment in time where the consequences of their actions are suspended. The absence of divine intervention in the final line underscores the speaker's moral blindness and the absence of redemption for his actions. Ultimately, "Porphyria's Lover" serves as a chilling exploration of the thin line between love and possession, sanity and madness.

## A Little Budding Rose by Emily Bronte

```
It was a little budding rose,
Round like a fairy globe,
And shyly did its leaves unclose
Hid in their mossy robe,
But sweet was the slight and spicy smell
It breathed from its heart invisible.

The rose is blasted, withered, blighted,
Its root has felt a worm,
And like a heart beloved and slighted,
Failed, faded, shrunk its form.
Bud of beauty, bonnie flower,
I stole thee from thy natal bower.

I was the worm that withered thee,
Thy tears of dew all fell for me;
Leaf and stalk and rose are gone,
Exile earth they died upon.
Yes, that last breath of balmy scent
With alien breezes sadly blent!
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "A Little Budding Rose" by Emily Bronte consists of two stanzas, each with eight lines. The rhyme scheme of the first stanza is ABABCDCD, while the second stanza follows a similar pattern of ABABCDCD. The meter is primarily iambic tetrameter, with four beats per line. The structured rhyme and meter give the poem a lyrical and musical quality, enhancing the emotional impact of the speaker's lament over the rose's fate.

### Themes and Imagery

The overarching theme of the poem revolves around the transient nature of beauty and the destructive power of love. The rose symbolizes beauty and innocence, depicted as a fragile being that is ultimately destroyed. The imagery of the "little budding rose" and its transformation into a "blasted, withered, blighted" flower conveys the idea of decay and loss. The speaker's role as the "worm" that causes the rose's demise highlights the theme of betrayal and the destructive nature of unrequited love.

### Literary Devices

Bronte employs various literary devices to enhance the poem's impact. The use of personification is evident in lines such as "But sweet was the slight and spicy smell / It breathed from its heart invisible," where the rose is described as having human-like qualities. The metaphor of the rose as a "heart beloved and slighted" emphasizes the emotional weight of the rose's fate. Additionally, imagery is used effectively throughout the poem to evoke a sense of beauty, loss, and sorrow.

### Historical and Personal Context

Emily Bronte's personal experiences likely influenced the themes present in the poem. As a Romantic poet, Bronte often explored themes of nature, beauty, and the complexities of human emotions. The speaker's sense of guilt and remorse for causing the rose's demise may reflect Bronte's own struggles with unfulfilled love or feelings of betrayal. The poem's focus on the fleeting nature of beauty also aligns with Romantic ideals of the impermanence of life and love.

### Deep Reading

On a deeper level, "A Little Budding Rose" can be interpreted as a reflection on the destructive power of love and the inevitable decay that accompanies it. The speaker's role as both the admirer and destroyer of the rose highlights the paradoxical nature of love, which can bring both joy and pain. The image of the rose's final breath blending with "alien breezes" suggests a sense of loss and separation, emphasizing the speaker's feelings of alienation and regret. Ultimately, the poem serves as a poignant meditation on the complexities of human relationships and the fragility of beauty.

## Easter Week by Joyce Kilmer

```
(In memory of Joseph Mary Plunkett)

("Romantic Ireland's dead and gone,
It's with O'Leary in the grave.")

William Butler Yeats.

"Romantic Ireland's dead and gone,
It's with O'Leary in the grave."
Then, Yeats, what gave that Easter dawn
A hue so radiantly brave?
There was a rain of blood that day,
Red rain in gay blue April weather.
It blessed the earth till it gave birth
To valour thick as blooms of heather.
Romantic Ireland never dies!
O'Leary lies in fertile ground,
And songs and spears throughout the years
Rise up where patriot graves are found.
Immortal patriots newly dead
And ye that bled in bygone years,
What banners rise before your eyes?
What is the tune that greets your ears?
The young Republic's banners smile
For many a mile where troops convene.
O'Connell Street is loudly sweet
With strains of Wearing of the Green.
The soil of Ireland throbs and glows
With life that knows the hour is here
To strike again like Irishmen
For that which Irishmen hold dear.
Lord Edward leaves his resting place
And Sarsfield's face is glad and fierce.
See Emmet leap from troubled sleep
To grasp the hand of Padraic Pearse!
There is no rope can strangle song
And not for long death takes his toll.
No prison bars can dim the stars
Nor quicklime eat the living soul.
Romantic Ireland is not old.
For years untold her youth will shine.
Her heart is fed on Heavenly bread,
The blood of martyrs is her wine.
```
