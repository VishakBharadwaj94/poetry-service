## The Cathedral of Rheims by Joyce Kilmer

```
(From the French of Emile Verhaeren)

He who walks through the meadows of Champagne
At noon in Fall, when leaves like gold appear,
Sees it draw near
Like some great mountain set upon the plain,
From radiant dawn until the close of day,
Nearer it grows
To him who goes
Across the country.  When tall towers lay
Their shadowy pall
Upon his way,
He enters, where
The solid stone is hollowed deep by all
Its centuries of beauty and of prayer.
Ancient French temple! thou whose hundred kings
Watch over thee, emblazoned on thy walls,
Tell me, within thy memory-hallowed halls
What chant of triumph, or what war-song rings?
Thou hast known Clovis and his Frankish train,
Whose mighty hand Saint Remy's hand did keep
And in thy spacious vault perhaps may sleep
An echo of the voice of Charlemagne.
For God thou has known fear, when from His side
Men wandered, seeking alien shrines and new,
But still the sky was bountiful and blue
And thou wast crowned with France's love and pride.
Sacred thou art, from pinnacle to base;
And in thy panes of gold and scarlet glass
The setting sun sees thousandfold his face;
Sorrow and joy, in stately silence pass
Across thy walls, the shadow and the light;
Around thy lofty pillars, tapers white
Illuminate, with delicate sharp flames,
The brows of saints with venerable names,
And in the night erect a fiery wall.
A great but silent fervour burns in all
Those simple folk who kneel, pathetic, dumb,
And know that down below, beside the Rhine --
Cannon, horses, soldiers, flags in line --
With blare of trumpets, mighty armies come.
Suddenly, each knows fear;
Swift rumours pass, that every one must hear,
The hostile banners blaze against the sky
And by the embassies mobs rage and cry.
Now war has come, and peace is at an end.
On Paris town the German troops descend.
They are turned back, and driven to Champagne.
And now, as to so many weary men,
The glorious temple gives them welcome, when
It meets them at the bottom of the plain.
At once, they set their cannon in its way.
There is no gable now, nor wall
That does not suffer, night and day,
As shot and shell in crushing torrents fall.
The stricken tocsin quivers through the tower;
The triple nave, the apse, the lonely choir
Are circled, hour by hour,
With thundering bands of fire
And Death is scattered broadcast among men.
And then
That which was splendid with baptismal grace;
The stately arches soaring into space,
The transepts, columns, windows gray and gold,
The organ, in whose tones the ocean rolled,
The crypts, of mighty shades the dwelling places,
The Virgin's gentle hands, the Saints' pure faces,
All, even the pardoning hands of Christ the Lord
Were struck and broken by the wanton sword
Of sacrilegious lust.
O beauty slain, O glory in the dust!
Strong walls of faith, most basely overthrown!
The crawling flames, like adders glistening
Ate the white fabric of this lovely thing.
Now from its soul arose a piteous moan,
The soul that always loved the just and fair.
Granite and marble loud their woe confessed,
The silver monstrances that Popes had blessed,
The chalices and lamps and crosiers rare
Were seared and twisted by a flaming breath;
The horror everywhere did range and swell,
The guardian Saints into this furnace fell,
Their bitter tears and screams were stilled in death.
Around the flames armed hosts are skirmishing,
The burning sun reflects the lurid scene;
The German army, fighting for its life,
Rallies its torn and terrified left wing;
And, as they near this place
The imperial eagles see
Before them in their flight,
Here, in the solemn night,
The old cathedral, to the years to be
Showing, with wounded arms, their own disgrace.
```

The poem "The Cathedral of Rheims" by Joyce Kilmer follows a structured form with a consistent ABAB rhyme scheme throughout most of the poem.

### Themes and Imagery

The poem explores themes of war, destruction, faith, and beauty. Through vivid imagery, the poet paints a picture of the Cathedral of Rheims as a symbol of faith and resilience, standing tall amidst the ravages of war. The imagery of the cathedral's architecture, stained glass windows, and sacred relics conveys a sense of awe and reverence. The contrast between the peacefulness of the cathedral and the chaos of war creates a poignant juxtaposition, highlighting the fragility of beauty in the face of destruction.

### Literary Devices

Kilmer employs various literary devices to enhance the poem's impact. One such device is personification, as seen in lines like "The stricken tocsin quivers through the tower" and "The crawling flames, like adders glistening." These instances give life to inanimate objects, intensifying the emotional resonance of the poem. Alliteration is also used effectively, such as in "Sorrow and joy, in stately silence pass," creating a musical quality that adds to the poem's lyrical nature.

### Historical and Personal Context

The poem is a reflection on the destruction of the Cathedral of Rheims during World War I. Kilmer's portrayal of the cathedral as a symbol of faith and cultural heritage speaks to the broader context of the devastation caused by the war. As a devout Catholic and poet, Kilmer likely felt a personal connection to the themes of faith and loss depicted in the poem. The historical context of the cathedral being targeted during the war adds a layer of significance to the poem's portrayal of destruction and resilience.

### Deep Reading

Through the destruction of the Cathedral of Rheims, Kilmer delves into deeper themes of the impermanence of beauty and the enduring power of faith. The poem serves as a meditation on the impact of war on cultural heritage and the resilience of human spirit in the face of adversity. By juxtaposing the serene beauty of the cathedral with the brutality of war, Kilmer prompts readers to contemplate the fragility of human creations and the enduring legacy of faith and art. The poem ultimately becomes a poignant elegy for a lost masterpiece, inviting reflection on the interconnectedness of history, art, and the human experience.

## Rain by Edward Thomas

```
RAIN, midnight rain, nothing but the wild rain
On this bleak hut, and solitude, and me
Remembering again that I shall die
And neither hear the rain nor give it thanks
For washing me cleaner than I have been
Since I was born into this solitude.
Blessed are the dead that the rain rains upon:
But here I pray that none whom once I loved
Is dying to-night or lying still awake
Solitary, listening to the rain,
Either in pain or thus in sympathy
Helpless among the living and the dead,
Like a cold water among broken reeds,
Myriads of broken reeds all still and stiff,
Like me who have no love which this wild rain
Has not dissolved except the love of death,
If love it be towards what is perfect and
Cannot, the tempest tells me, disappoint.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

In terms of form, Edward Thomas's poem "Rain" consists of a single stanza with 19 lines. The poem does not follow a strict rhyme scheme, which contributes to the sense of solitude and reflection conveyed in the poem. The lack of a consistent rhyme scheme mirrors the speaker's contemplation of mortality and loneliness. 

The meter of the poem is predominantly iambic, with lines varying in length and rhythm. For example, the opening line "RAIN, midnight rain, nothing but the wild rain" contains trochees and anapests, creating a sense of urgency and chaos that mirrors the wildness of the rain itself. This fluctuation in meter adds to the overall tone of uncertainty and introspection in the poem.

The structure of the poem, with its long, flowing lines, reflects the speaker's stream of consciousness as he contemplates life, death, and the cleansing power of rain. The lack of stanza breaks reinforces the idea of a continuous and unbroken reflection on mortality and solitude.

### Themes and Imagery

One of the central themes in "Rain" is the contemplation of mortality and the passage of time. The speaker reflects on the inevitability of death, expressing a sense of resignation and acceptance. The imagery of rain as a cleansing force is used metaphorically to suggest a spiritual renewal or purification. The rain is described as washing the speaker cleaner than he has ever been, symbolizing a fresh start or rebirth.

Solitude and loneliness are also prominent themes in the poem. The speaker is isolated in a bleak hut, surrounded by the sound of rain and his own thoughts. The image of broken reeds and the comparison to the speaker's own stiff and still existence convey a sense of emotional and spiritual desolation.

### Literary Devices

Thomas employs various literary devices to enhance the mood and meaning of the poem. The repetition of the word "rain" throughout the poem emphasizes its significance as a symbol of renewal and cleansing. The use of simile, such as "Like a cold water among broken reeds," creates a vivid image of the speaker's emotional state and his sense of alienation.

The poem also features personification, as the rain is described as having the ability to "dissolve" the speaker's love. This personification adds a sense of agency to the rain, suggesting that it has a transformative power over the speaker's emotions and beliefs.

### Historical and Personal Context

Edward Thomas was writing during a time of great social and political upheaval, with World War I looming on the horizon. This sense of impending doom and uncertainty is reflected in the themes of mortality and solitude in "Rain." Thomas himself struggled with depression and personal turmoil, which likely influenced his exploration of these themes in his poetry.

The poem can also be seen as a reflection of Thomas's deep connection to nature and his belief in its restorative power. The rain, in this context, serves as a symbol of renewal and rebirth, offering the speaker a sense of solace and comfort in the face of his existential questions.

### Deep Reading

"Rain" ultimately delves into the complex emotions of the speaker as he grapples with the idea of mortality and solitude. The rain serves as a powerful symbol of transformation and renewal, highlighting the cyclical nature of life and death. The lack of a consistent rhyme scheme and the fluctuating meter mirror the speaker's inner turmoil and uncertainty, creating a sense of unease and contemplation.

The poem's exploration of love, death, and the imperfections of human relationships adds depth to its themes of isolation and introspection. Through vivid imagery and evocative language, Thomas invites readers to ponder the fleeting nature of life and the enduring power of nature to cleanse and renew the soul.

## From Sunset to Star Rise by Christina Rossetti

```
Go from me, summer friends, and tarry not:
I am no summer friend, but wintry cold,
A silly sheep benighted from the fold,
A sluggard with a thorn-choked garden plot.
Take counsel, sever from my lot your lot,
Dwell in your pleasant places, hoard your gold;
Lest you with me should shiver on the wold,
Athirst and hungering on a barren spot.
For I have hedged me with a thorny hedge,
I live alone, I look to die alone:
Yet sometimes, when a wind sighs through the sedge,
Ghosts of my buried years, and friends come back,
My heart goes sighing after swallows flown
On sometime summer's unreturning track.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "From Sunset to Star Rise" by Christina Rossetti consists of a single stanza with fourteen lines. It follows a traditional Petrarchan sonnet structure with an ABBA ABBA CDCDCD rhyme scheme.

The consistent structure and rhyme scheme give the poem a sense of order and control, mirroring the speaker's internal turmoil and loneliness.

### Themes and Imagery

The central themes of the poem revolve around loneliness, isolation, and loss. The speaker expresses a sense of detachment from others, referring to themselves as "wintry cold" and a "silly sheep benighted from the fold."

The mention of "Ghosts of my buried years" and "friends come back" highlights the speaker's longing for connection and nostalgia for happier times.

### Literary Devices

Additionally, the alliteration in "sometimes, when a wind sighs through the sedge" creates a sense of melancholy and longing.

### Historical and Personal Context

Christina Rossetti, a Victorian poet, often explored themes of love, loss, and spirituality in her work. As a devout Christian, her poetry frequently reflects her religious beliefs and personal struggles. In "From Sunset to Star Rise," Rossetti's own experiences of loneliness and isolation may have influenced the poem's introspective tone. The Victorian era was also characterized by social and moral constraints, which could have influenced the speaker's sense of alienation.

### Deep Reading

The speaker's plea for their "summer friends" to leave and not "tarry" reflects a fear of vulnerability and rejection. The contrast between the speaker's solitude and the memories of past connections emphasizes the pain of loss and the longing for companionship. The mention of "swallows flown on sometime summer's unreturning track" suggests a sense of regret and the impossibility of recapturing the past. Overall, the poem captures the universal experience of longing for connection while grappling with the inevitability of solitude.
