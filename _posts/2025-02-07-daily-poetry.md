## Father Gerard Hopkins, S. J. by Joyce Kilmer

```
Why didst thou carve thy speech laboriously,
And match and blend thy words with curious art?
For Song, one saith, is but a human heart
Speaking aloud, undisciplined and free.
Nay, God be praised, Who fixed thy task for thee!
Austere, ecstatic craftsman, set apart
From all who traffic in Apollo's mart,
On thy phrased paten shall the Splendour be!
Now, carelessly we throw a rhyme to God,
Singing His praise when other songs are done.
But thou, who knewest paths Teresa trod,
Losing thyself, what is it thou hast won?
O bleeding feet, with peace and glory shod!
O happy moth, that flew into the Sun!
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

In terms of form, "Father Gerard Hopkins, S. J." by Joyce Kilmer is a Petrarchan sonnet, consisting of an octave (eight lines) followed by a sestet (six lines). The rhyme scheme is ABBAABBA for the octave and CDECDE for the sestet. This traditional structure is fitting for the theme of the poem, as it allows for a gradual development and resolution of ideas within the confines of a strict form.

The meter of the poem is predominantly iambic pentameter, with lines like "Why didst thou carve thy speech laboriously" following this pattern. This regular meter adds a sense of rhythm and musicality to the poem, enhancing its overall aesthetic appeal.

### Themes and Imagery

The poem explores the theme of artistic craftsmanship and the dedication required to create meaningful art. The speaker questions the necessity of meticulous craftsmanship in poetry, contrasting it with the idea that true art should come from the heart, "undisciplined and free." Through the imagery of carving speech laboriously and matching words with curious art, the poem highlights the dedication and discipline required for artistic creation.

The imagery of the "phrased paten" symbolizes the sacred nature of Hopkins' poetry, suggesting that his work is a vessel for divine inspiration. The references to Teresa and the moth flying into the sun further emphasize the idea of spiritual transcendence and the rewards that come from losing oneself in the pursuit of art.

### Literary Devices

Kilmer employs various literary devices throughout the poem to enhance its meaning. One notable device is personification, ascribing human qualities to abstract concepts like Song and the Splendour. This personification serves to elevate the themes of art and spirituality present in the poem.

Alliteration is also employed in lines such as "Austere, ecstatic craftsman," creating a musical quality and drawing attention to the contrast between austerity and ecstasy in Hopkins' work. Additionally, the use of biblical allusions, such as references to God and Teresa, adds depth and religious significance to the poem.

### Historical and Personal Context

Joyce Kilmer, a Catholic convert, wrote this poem as a tribute to the Jesuit priest and poet Gerard Manley Hopkins, whose innovative poetic style and religious themes greatly influenced Kilmer's own work. Kilmer's admiration for Hopkins is evident in the poem, as he praises Hopkins' dedication to his craft and his ability to infuse his poetry with spiritual depth.

During the time when Kilmer wrote this poem (early 20th century), traditional poetic forms like the sonnet were still highly regarded, and poets often sought to emulate the craftsmanship and discipline of earlier literary masters. Kilmer's choice of the Petrarchan sonnet form reflects this reverence for tradition and craftsmanship in poetry.

### Deep Reading

On a deeper level, "Father Gerard Hopkins, S. J." can be seen as a meditation on the nature of artistic inspiration and the sacrifices that artists make in pursuit of their craft. The poem suggests that true art requires a blend of discipline and passion, as represented by the austere yet ecstatic figure of Hopkins. By likening Hopkins to a "happy moth" that flies into the sun, Kilmer celebrates the artist's willingness to sacrifice himself for the sake of his art, ultimately finding peace and glory in his creative pursuits. This vision of artistic dedication and spiritual transcendence serves as a powerful tribute to Hopkins and a reflection on the enduring legacy of his poetry.

## Buried Life, The by Matthew Arnold

```
Light flows our war of mocking words, and yet,
Behold, with tears mine eyes are wet!
I feel a nameless sadness o'er me roll.
Yes, yes, we know that we can jest,
We know, we know that we can smile!
But there's a something in this breast,
To which thy light words bring no rest,
And thy gay smiles no anodyne.
Give me thy hand, and hush awhile,
And turn those limpid eyes on mine,
And let me read there, love! thy inmost soul.

Alas! is even love too weak
To unlock the heart, and let it speak?
Are even lovers powerless to reveal
To one another what indeed they feel?
I knew the mass of men conceal'd
Their thoughts, for fear that if reveal'd
They would by other men be met
With blank indifference, or with blame reproved;
I knew they lived and moved
Trick'd in disguises, alien to the rest
Of men, and alien to themselves--and yet
The same heart beats in every human breast!

But we, my love!--doth a like spell benumb
Our hearts, our voices?--must we too be dumb?

Ah! well for us, if even we,
Even for a moment, can get free
Our heart, and have our lips unchain'd;
For that which seals them hath been deep-ordain'd!

Fate, which foresaw
How frivolous a baby man would be--
By what distractions he would be possess'd,
How he would pour himself in every strife,
And well-nigh change his own identity--
That it might keep from his capricious play
His genuine self, and force him to obey
Even in his own despite his being's law,
Bade through the deep recesses of our breast
The unregarded river of our life
Pursue with indiscernible flow its way;
And that we should not see
The buried stream, and seem to be
Eddying at large in blind uncertainty,
Though driving on with it eternally.

But often, in the world's most crowded streets,
But often, in the din of strife,
There rises an unspeakable desire
After the knowledge of our buried life;
A thirst to spend our fire and restless force
In tracking out our true, original course;
A longing to inquire
Into the mystery of this heart which beats
So wild, so deep in us--to know
Whence our lives come and where they go.
And many a man in his own breast then delves,
But deep enough, alas! none ever mines.
And we have been on many thousand lines,
And we have shown, on each, spirit and power;
But hardly have we, for one little hour,
Been on our own line, have we been ourselves--
Hardly had skill to utter one of all
The nameless feelings that course through our breast,
But they course on for ever unexpress'd.
And long we try in vain to speak and act
Our hidden self, and what we say and do
Is eloquent, is well--but 't#is not true!
And then we will no more be rack'd
With inward striving, and demand
Of all the thousand nothings of the hour
Their stupefying power;
Ah yes, and they benumb us at our call!
Yet still, from time to time, vague and forlorn,
From the soul's subterranean depth upborne
As from an infinitely distant land,
Come airs, and floating echoes, and convey
A melancholy into all our day.
Only--but this is rare--
When a belov{'e}d hand is laid in ours,
When, jaded with the rush and glare
Of the interminable hours,
Our eyes can in another's eyes read clear,
When our world-deafen'd ear
Is by the tones of a loved voice caress'd--
A bolt is shot back somewhere in our breast,
And a lost pulse of feeling stirs again.
The eye sinks inward, and the heart lies plain,
And what we mean, we say, and what we would, we know.
A man becomes aware of his life's flow,
And hears its winding murmur; and he sees
The meadows where it glides, the sun, the breeze.

And there arrives a lull in the hot race
Wherein he doth for ever chase
That flying and elusive shadow, rest.
An air of coolness plays upon his face,
And an unwonted calm pervades his breast.
And then he thinks he knows
The hills where his life rose,
And the sea where it goes.
```

### Literary Devices

Arnold employs various literary devices throughout the poem to enhance its themes and imagery. One notable device is the use of personification, as seen in lines such as "Fate, which foresaw / How frivolous a baby man would be."

### Historical and Personal Context

## Sonnet 19 - The soul's Rialto hath its merchandise by Elizabeth Barrett Browning

```
XIX

The soul's Rialto hath its merchandise;
I barter curl for curl upon that mart,
And from my poet's forehead to my heart
Receive this lock which outweighs argosies,—
As purply black, as erst to Pindar's eyes
The dim purpureal tresses gloomed athwart
The nine white Muse-brows. For this counterpart, . . .
The bay-crown's shade, Beloved, I surmise,
Still lingers on thy curl, it is so black!
Thus, with a fillet of smooth-kissing breath,
I tie the shadows safe from gliding back,
And lay the gift where nothing hindereth;
Here on my heart, as on thy brow, to lack
No natural heat till mine grows cold in death.
```

### Word Suggestions

Consider these word pairs that complement your poem's tone:

- **water** (Germanic) / **aqueous** (Latinate)
  - *The word 'water' is simple and direct, evoking a sense of familiarity and comfort. 'Aqueous', on the other hand, has a more scientific and formal tone, emphasizing the chemical properties of water. For a poem focused on sensory details and nostalgia, 'water' would be more emotionally resonant and accessible.*
  - **Recommended:** Use the germanic version to enhance your poem's tone

- **sight** (Germanic) / **vision** (Latinate)
  - *While 'sight' is a common and straightforward term, 'vision' has a more abstract and metaphorical connotation, often associated with imagination and foresight.

- **stretch** (Germanic) / **extend** (Latinate)
  - *'Stretch' implies a physical action of lengthening or expanding, conveying a sense of effort or reaching beyond limits.
