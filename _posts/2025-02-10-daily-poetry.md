## Perplexed Music by Elizabeth Barrett Browning

```
EXPERIENCE, like a pale musician, holds
A dulcimer of patience in his hand,
Whence harmonies, we cannot understand,
Of God; will in his worlds, the strain unfolds
In sad-perplexed minors: deathly colds
Fall on us while we hear, and countermand
Our sanguine heart back from the fancyland
With nightingales in visionary wolds.
We murmur ' Where is any certain tune
Or measured music in such notes as these ? '
But angels, leaning from the golden seat,
Are not so minded their fine ear hath won
The issue of completed cadences,
And, smiling down the stars, they whisper--
SWEET.
```

The use of "harmonies" and "strain" suggests a musical metaphor for the complexities of life and the challenges we face.

### Literary Devices

The use of personification is evident in lines such as "Experience, like a pale musician" and "Our sanguine heart back from the fancyland," giving human qualities to abstract concepts. The metaphor of music is extended throughout the poem, with references to "harmonies," "cadences," and "measured music," creating a sense of rhythm and melody in the language.

Browning's skillful use of musical imagery and metaphor invites readers to contemplate the mysteries of life and the presence of divine harmony in the midst of confusion and doubt.

## Far from Love the Heavenly Father by Emily Dickinson

```
Far from Love the Heavenly Father
Leads the Chosen Child,
Oftener through Realm of Briar

Oftener by the Claw of Dragon
Than the Hand of Friend
Guides the Little One predestined
To the Native Land.

## Pine-Trees and the Sky: Evening by Rupert Brooke

```
I'd watched the sorrow of the evening sky,
And smelt the sea, and earth, and the warm clover,
And heard the waves, and the seagull's mocking cry.

And in them all was only the old cry,
That song they always sing -- "The best is over!
You may remember now, and think, and sigh,
O silly lover!"
And I was tired and sick that all was over,
And because I,
For all my thinking, never could recover
One moment of the good hours that were over.
And I was sorry and sick, and wished to die.

Then from the sad west turning wearily,
I saw the pines against the white north sky,
Very beautiful, and still, and bending over
Their sharp black heads against a quiet sky.
And there was peace in them; and I
Was happy, and forgot to play the lover,
And laughed, and did no longer wish to die;
Being glad of you, O pine-trees and the sky!
```
