## Moonlight, summer moonlight by Emily Bronte

```
'Tis moonlight, summer moonlight,
All soft and still and fair;
The solemn hour of midnight
Breathes sweet thoughts everywhere,

But most where trees are sending
Their breezy boughs on high,
Or stooping low are lending
A shelter from the sky.

And there in those wild bowers
A lovely form is laid;
Green grass and dew-steeped flowers
Wave gently round her head.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

### Themes and Imagery

The central themes of the poem revolve around the tranquility and beauty of the natural world, particularly under the enchanting light of the moon. Bronte captures the peacefulness of a summer night illuminated by moonlight, creating a serene and mystical atmosphere. The imagery of "soft and still and fair" moonlight evokes a sense of calm and beauty, while the description of trees providing shelter and a lovely form laid in a wild bower conveys a feeling of peace and harmony with nature. The image of "green grass and dew-steeped flowers" waving gently around the figure adds to the sense of tranquility and natural beauty.

### Literary Devices

Bronte employs various literary devices to enhance the poem's imagery and evoke emotions in the reader. The repetition of the word "moonlight" emphasizes the central focus of the poem and creates a soothing rhythm. The use of alliteration in phrases like "breathes sweet thoughts everywhere" and "green grass and dew-steeped flowers" adds a musical quality to the poem and enhances its sensory imagery. Additionally, the personification of the trees as "sending their breezy boughs on high" and "stooping low" adds depth to the natural imagery and creates a sense of movement and life within the scene.

### Historical and Personal Context

Emily Bronte, best known for her novel "Wuthering Heights," was a Romantic poet who often explored themes of nature, emotion, and the sublime in her works. "Moonlight, summer moonlight" reflects Bronte's deep connection to nature and her ability to capture its beauty and tranquility in her poetry. The poem's focus on the peacefulness of a summer night and the harmony between nature and humanity is characteristic of Romantic literature, which sought to celebrate the awe-inspiring power of nature and the emotional experiences it evokes.

### Deep Reading

At a deeper level, "Moonlight, summer moonlight" can be seen as a reflection on the fleeting beauty and tranquility of nature, contrasting with the turmoil and chaos of human existence. The contrast between the stillness and beauty of the moonlit scene and the brevity of the moment captured in the poem's imagery suggests a sense of impermanence and the transience of life. The image of the "lovely form" laid in the wild bower surrounded by nature's beauty hints at themes of mortality and the cycle of life and death, adding a poignant and contemplative layer to the poem.

## Little Brown Baby by Paul Laurence Dunbar

```
Little brown baby wif spa'klin' eyes,
Come to yo' pappy an' set on his knee.
What you been doin', suh -- makin' san' pies?
Look at dat bib -- you's es du'ty ez me.
Look at dat mouf -- dat's merlasses, I bet;
Come hyeah, Maria, an' wipe off his han's.
Bees gwine to ketch you an' eat you up yit,
Bein' so sticky an sweet -- goodness lan's!
Little brown baby wif spa'klin' eyes,
Who's pappy's darlin' an' who's pappy's chile?
Who is it all de day nevah once tries
Fu' to be cross, er once loses dat smile?
Whah did you git dem teef? My, you's a scamp!
Whah did dat dimple come f'om in yo' chin?
Pappy do' know you -- I b'lieves you's a tramp;
Mammy, dis hyeah's some ol' straggler got in!

Let's th'ow him outen de do' in de san',
We do' want stragglers a-layin' 'roun' hyeah;
Let's gin him 'way to de big buggah-man;
I know he's hidin' erroun' hyeah right neah.
Buggah-man, buggah-man, come in de do',
Hyeah's a bad boy you kin have fu' to eat.
Mammy an' pappy do' want him no mo',
Swaller him down f'om his haid to his feet!

Dah, now, I t'ought dat you'd hug me up close.
Go back, ol' buggah, you sha'n't have dis boy.
He ain't no tramp, ner no straggler, of co'se;
He's pappy's pa'dner an' play-mate an' joy.
Come to you' pallet now -- go to yo' res';
Wisht you could allus know ease an' cleah skies;
Wisht you could stay jes' a chile on my breas'--
Little brown baby wif spa'klin' eyes!
```
