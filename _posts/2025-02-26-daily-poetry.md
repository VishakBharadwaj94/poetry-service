## Monna Innominata: A Sonnet of Sonnets by Christina Rossetti

```
1

Lo dм che han detto a' dolci amici addio. - Dante
Amor, con quanto sforzo oggi mi vinci! - Petrarca

Come back to me, who wait and watch for you:--
Or come not yet, for it is over then,
And long it is before you come again,
So far between my pleasures are and few.
While, when you come not, what I do I do
Thinking "Now when he comes," my sweetest when:"
For one man is my world of all the men
This wide world holds; O love, my world is you.
Howbeit, to meet you grows almost a pang
Because the pang of parting comes so soon;
My hope hangs waning, waxing, like a moon
Between the heavenly days on which we meet:
Ah me, but where are now the songs I sang
When life was sweet because you call'd them sweet?

2

Era giа 1'ora che volge il desio. - Dante
Ricorro al tempo ch' io vi vidi prima. - Petrarca

I wish I could remember that first day,
First hour, first moment of your meeting me,
If bright or dim the season, it might be
Summer or winter for aught I can say;
So unrecorded did it slip away,
So blind was I to see and to foresee,
So dull to mark the budding of my tree
That would not blossom yet for many a May.
If only I could recollect it, such
A day of days! I let it come and go
As traceless as a thaw of bygone snow;
It seem'd to mean so little, meant so much;
If only now I could recall that touch,
First touch of hand in hand--Did one but know!


3

O ombre vane, fuor che ne l'aspetto! - Dante
Immaginata guida la conduce. - Petrarca

I dream of you to wake: would that I might
Dream of you and not wake but slumber on;
Nor find with dreams the dear companion gone,
As summer ended summer birds take flight.
In happy dreams I hold you full in sight,
I blush again who waking look so wan;
Brighter than sunniest day that ever shone,
In happy dreams your smile makes day of night.
Thus only in a dream we are at one,
Thus only in a dream we give and take
The faith that maketh rich who take or give;
If thus to sleep is sweeter than to wake,
To die were surely sweeter than to live,
Though there be nothing new beneath the sun.


4

Poca favilla gran fliamma seconda. - Dante
Ogni altra cosa, ogni pensier va fore,
E sol ivi con voi rimansi amore. - Petrarca

I lov'd you first: but afterwards your love
Outsoaring mine, sang such a loftier song
As drown'd the friendly cooings of my dove.
Which owes the other most? my love was long,
And yours one moment seem'd to wax more strong;
I lov'd and guess'd at you, you construed me--
And lov'd me for what might or might not be
Nay, weights and measures do us both a wrong.
For verily love knows not "mine" or "thine;"
With separate "I" and "thou" free love has done,
For one is both and both are one in love:
Rich love knows nought of "thine that is not mine;"
Both have the strength and both the length thereof,
Both of us, of the love which makes us one.


5

Amor che a nullo amato amar perdona. - Dante
Amor m'addusse in sм gioiosa spene. - Petrarca

O my heart's heart, and you who are to me
More than myself myself, God be with you,
Keep you in strong obedience leal and true
To Him whose noble service setteth free,
Give you all good we see or can foresee,
Make your joys many and your sorrows few,
Bless you in what you bear and what you do,
Yea, perfect you as He would have you be.
So much for you; but what for me, dear friend?
To love you without stint and all I can
Today, tomorrow, world without an end;
To love you much and yet to love you more,
As Jordan at his flood sweeps either shore;
Since woman is the helpmeet made for man.


6

Or puoi la quantitate
Comprender de l'amor che a te mi scalda. - Dante
Non vo' che da tal nodo mi scioglia. - Petrarca

Trust me, I have not earn'd your dear rebuke,
I love, as you would have me, God the most;
Would lose not Him, but you, must one be lost,
Nor with Lot's wife cast back a faithless look
Unready to forego what I forsook;
This say I, having counted up the cost,
This, though I be the feeblest of God's host,
The sorriest sheep Christ shepherds with His crook.
Yet while I love my God the most, I deem
That I can never love you overmuch;
I love Him more, so let me love you too;
Yea, as I apprehend it, love is such
I cannot love you if I love not Him,
I cannot love Him if I love not you.


7

Qui primavera sempre ed ogni frutto. - Dante
Ragionando con meco ed io con lui. - Petrarca

"Love me, for I love you"--and answer me,
"Love me, for I love you"--so shall we stand
As happy equals in the flowering land
Of love, that knows not a dividing sea.
Love builds the house on rock and not on sand,
Love laughs what while the winds rave desperately;
And who hath found love's citadel unmann'd?
And who hath held in bonds love's liberty?
My heart's a coward though my words are brave
We meet so seldom, yet we surely part
So often; there's a problem for your art!
Still I find comfort in his Book, who saith,
Though jealousy be cruel as the grave,
And death be strong, yet love is strong as death.


8

Come dicesse a Dio: D'altro non calme. - Dante
Spero trovar pietа non che perdono. - Petrarca

"I, if I perish, perish"--Esther spake:
And bride of life or death she made her fair
In all the lustre of her perfum'd hair
And smiles that kindle longing but to slake.
She put on pomp of loveliness, to take
Her husband through his eyes at unaware;
She spread abroad her beauty for a snare,
Harmless as doves and subtle as a snake.
She trapp'd him with one mesh of silken hair,
She vanquish'd him by wisdom of her wit,
And built her people's house that it should stand:--
If I might take my life so in my hand,
And for my love to Love put up my prayer,
And for love's sake by Love be granted it!


9

O dignitosa coscienza e netta! - Dante
Spirto piщ acceso di virtuti ardenti. - Petrarca

Thinking of you, and all that was, and all
That might have been and now can never be,
I feel your honour'd excellence, and see
Myself unworthy of the happier call:
For woe is me who walk so apt to fall,
So apt to shrink afraid, so apt to flee,
Apt to lie down and die (ah, woe is me!)
Faithless and hopeless turning to the wall.
And yet not hopeless quite nor faithless quite,
Because not loveless; love may toil all night,
But take at morning; wrestle till the break
Of day, but then wield power with God and man:--
So take I heart of grace as best I can,
Ready to spend and be spent for your sake.


10

Con miglior corso e con migliore stella. - Dante
La vita fugge e non s'arresta un' ora. - Petrarca

Time flies, hope flags, life plies a wearied wing;
Death following hard on life gains ground apace;
Faith runs with each and rears an eager face,
Outruns the rest, makes light of everything,
Spurns earth, and still finds breath to pray and sing;
While love ahead of all uplifts his praise,
Still asks for grace and still gives thanks for grace,
Content with all day brings and night will bring.
Life wanes; and when love folds his wings above
Tired hope, and less we feel his conscious pulse,
Let us go fall asleep, dear friend, in peace:
A little while, and age and sorrow cease;
A little while, and life reborn annuls
Loss and decay and death, and all is love.


11

Vien dietro a me e lascia dir le genti. - Dante
Contando i casi della vita nostra. - Petrarca

Many in aftertimes will say of you
"He lov'd her"--while of me what will they say?
Not that I lov'd you more than just in play,
For fashion's sake as idle women do.
Even let them prate; who know not what we knew
Of love and parting in exceeding pain,
Of parting hopeless here to meet again,
Hopeless on earth, and heaven is out of view.
But by my heart of love laid bare to you,
My love that you can make not void nor vain,
Love that foregoes you but to claim anew
Beyond this passage of the gate of death,
I charge you at the Judgment make it plain
My love of you was life and not a breath.


12

Amor, che ne la mente mi ragiona. - Dante
Amor vien nel bel viso di costei. - Petrarca

If there be any one can take my place
And make you happy whom I grieve to grieve,
Think not that I can grudge it, but believe
I do commend you to that nobler grace,
That readier wit than mine, that sweeter face;
Yea, since your riches make me rich, conceive
I too am crown'd, while bridal crowns I weave,
And thread the bridal dance with jocund pace.
For if I did not love you, it might be
That I should grudge you some one dear delight;
But since the heart is yours that was mine own,
Your pleasure is my pleasure, right my right,
Your honourable freedom makes me free,
And you companion'd I am not alone.


13

E drizzeremo gli occhi al Primo Amore. - Dante
Ma trovo peso non da le mie braccia. - Petrarca

If I could trust mine own self with your fate,
Shall I not rather trust it in God's hand?
Without Whose Will one lily doth not stand,
Nor sparrow fall at his appointed date;
Who numbereth the innumerable sand,
Who weighs the wind and water with a weight,
To Whom the world is neither small nor great,
Whose knowledge foreknew every plan we plann'd.
Searching my heart for all that touches you,
I find there only love and love's goodwill
Helpless to help and impotent to do,
Of understanding dull, of sight most dim;
And therefore I commend you back to Him
Whose love your love's capacity can fill.


14

E la Sua Volontade и nostra pace. - Dante
Sol con questi pensier, con altre chiome. - Petrarca

Youth gone, and beauty gone if ever there
Dwelt beauty in so poor a face as this;
Youth gone and beauty, what remains of bliss?
I will not bind fresh roses in my hair,
To shame a cheek at best but little fair,--
Leave youth his roses, who can bear a thorn,--
I will not seek for blossoms anywhere,
Except such common flowers as blow with corn.
Youth gone and beauty gone, what doth remain?
The longing of a heart pent up forlorn,
A silent heart whose silence loves and longs;
The silence of a heart which sang its songs
While youth and beauty made a summer morn,
Silence of love that cannot sing again.
```

## Spring Offensive by Wilfred Owen

```
Halted against the shade of a last hill,
They fed, and, lying easy, were at ease
And, finding comfortable chests and knees
Carelessly slept.  But many there stood still
To face the stark, blank sky beyond the ridge,
Knowing their feet had come to the end of the world.

Marvelling they stood, and watched the long grass swirled
By the May breeze, murmurous with wasp and midge,
For though the summer oozed into their veins
Like the injected drug for their bones' pains,
Sharp on their souls hung the imminent line of grass,
Fearfully flashed the sky's mysterious glass.

Hour after hour they ponder the warm field --
And the far valley behind, where the buttercups
Had blessed with gold their slow boots coming up,
Where even the little brambles would not yield,
But clutched and clung to them like sorrowing hands;
They breathe like trees unstirred.

Till like a cold gust thrilled the little word
At which each body and its soul begird
And tighten them for battle.  No alarms
Of bugles, no high flags, no clamorous haste --
Only a lift and flare of eyes that faced
The sun, like a friend with whom their love is done.
O larger shone that smile against the sun, --
Mightier than his whose bounty these have spurned.

So, soon they topped the hill, and raced together
Over an open stretch of herb and heather
Exposed.  And instantly the whole sky burned
With fury against them; and soft sudden cups
Opened in thousands for their blood; and the green slopes
Chasmed and steepened sheer to infinite space.

Of them who running on that last high place
Leapt to swift unseen bullets, or went up
On the hot blast and fury of hell's upsurge,
Or plunged and fell away past this world's verge,
Some say God caught them even before they fell.

But what say such as from existence' brink
Ventured but drave too swift to sink.
The few who rushed in the body to enter hell,
And there out-fiending all its fiends and flames
With superhuman inhumanities,
Long-famous glories, immemorial shames --
And crawling slowly back, have by degrees
Regained cool peaceful air in wonder --
Why speak they not of comrades that went under?
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

"Spring Offensive" by Wilfred Owen is a poem that consists of five stanzas with varying line lengths and no specific rhyme scheme. The irregular structure of the poem mirrors the chaotic and unpredictable nature of war. The lack of a strict meter also reflects the disarray and confusion faced by the soldiers on the battlefield. The enjambment used throughout the poem contributes to the sense of a continuous flow, creating a feeling of urgency and movement, much like the soldiers' experience in battle.

### Themes and Imagery

The themes of war, nature, and the juxtaposition between the beauty of spring and the brutality of conflict are central in "Spring Offensive." The poem vividly describes the tranquility and beauty of nature before abruptly transitioning to the chaos and violence of war. Owen uses imagery of the natural world, such as the long grass, May breeze, and buttercups, to highlight the stark contrast between the peaceful surroundings and the horrors of battle. The imagery of blood, bullets, and hellish landscapes conveys the brutal reality of war and the impact it has on the soldiers involved.

### Literary Devices

Owen employs various literary devices throughout the poem to convey the themes and emotions effectively. Alliteration is used in phrases like "stood still" and "fearfully flashed," emphasizing the soldiers' sense of dread and anticipation. Owen also utilizes personification, such as the grass "knowing their feet had come to the end of the world," to create a sense of foreboding and unease. The use of similes, as seen in "murmurous with wasp and midge," adds depth to the descriptions of nature and enhances the contrast between the peaceful setting and the impending battle.

### Historical and Personal Context

Wilfred Owen was a soldier in World War I, and his firsthand experience of the brutality and futility of war heavily influenced his poetry. "Spring Offensive" reflects Owen's disillusionment with the glorification of war and his desire to depict its true nature. The poem captures the conflicting emotions of soldiers facing the possibility of death and the contrast between the beauty of nature and the destruction of warfare. Owen's personal experiences on the battlefield inform the authenticity and raw emotion present in his work.

### Deep Reading

"Spring Offensive" delves into the psychological and emotional turmoil experienced by soldiers as they confront the harsh realities of war. The poem portrays the soldiers as both victims of circumstance and participants in a larger, incomprehensible conflict. The juxtaposition of the serene natural imagery with the violent and chaotic scenes of battle serves to highlight the senselessness and brutality of war. Owen challenges traditional notions of heroism and valor, instead focusing on the human cost and devastation caused by war. Ultimately, "Spring Offensive" serves as a poignant reminder of the toll that war takes on individuals and society as a whole.

## Roses by Joyce Kilmer

```
(For Katherine Bregy)

I went to gather roses and twine them in a ring,
For I would make a posy, a posy for the King.
I got an hundred roses, the loveliest there be,
From the white rose vine and the pink rose bush and from the red
rose tree.
But when I took my posy and laid it at His feet
I found He had His roses a million times more sweet.
There was a scarlet blossom upon each foot and hand,
And a great pink rose bloomed from His side for the healing of the
land.
Now of this fair and awful King there is this marvel told,
That He wears a crown of linked thorns instead of one of gold.
Where there are thorns are roses, and I saw a line of red,
A little wreath of roses around His radiant head.
A red rose is His Sacred Heart, a white rose is His face,
And His breath has turned the barren world to a rich and flowery
place.
He is the Rose of Sharon, His gardener am I,
And I shall drink His fragrance in Heaven when I die.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

In this poem, "Roses" by Joyce Kilmer, the form is structured with a consistent rhyme scheme of ABAB throughout each quatrain. The poem consists of six quatrains, and each quatrain follows this pattern. The meter is primarily iambic, with lines that alternate between tetrameter and trimeter, giving the poem a rhythmic and musical quality. The regular rhyme scheme and meter contribute to the overall flow and beauty of the poem.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem revolves around the symbolism of roses in relation to Christ. The act of gathering roses to make a posy for the King reflects the speaker's desire to offer something beautiful to Christ. However, upon presenting the posy, the speaker realizes that Christ's own suffering and sacrifice far surpass the beauty of any earthly roses. The imagery of roses is used to depict Christ's wounds, such as the scarlet blossom on His hands and feet, and the pink rose blooming from His side. This imagery serves to highlight Christ's sacrificial love and the transformative power of His suffering.

### Literary Devices

Kilmer employs various literary devices in the poem, such as symbolism and metaphor. The roses symbolize beauty, love, and sacrifice, while Christ is metaphorically referred to as the "Rose of Sharon." The use of imagery, such as the crown of thorns and the wreath of roses around Christ's head, creates vivid and powerful visual representations of Christ's suffering and glory. Additionally, the repetition of the word "rose" throughout the poem reinforces the central motif and adds to the thematic depth.

### Historical and Personal Context

Joyce Kilmer, a devout Catholic, wrote this poem as a reflection on his faith and his understanding of Christ's sacrifice. The title "Roses" suggests a connection to the Virgin Mary, often symbolized by roses in Catholic tradition. The poem's focus on Christ's wounds and redemptive love aligns with Christian theology and the concept of Christ as the ultimate sacrifice for humanity's sins. Kilmer's personal faith and devotion to Christ are evident in the imagery and reverence with which he portrays the figure of Christ in the poem.

### Deep Reading

On a deeper level, "Roses" can be seen as a meditation on the paradoxical nature of Christ's suffering and glory. The juxtaposition of the earthly roses gathered by the speaker with the divine roses symbolizing Christ's wounds underscores the idea that true beauty and redemption come through sacrifice and suffering. The transformation of the barren world into a "rich and flowery place" through Christ's presence reflects the theme of renewal and spiritual growth. Kilmer's portrayal of Christ as the ultimate source of beauty and fragrance suggests a profound connection between the physical and spiritual realms, where the material world is infused with divine grace. Ultimately, the poem conveys a message of hope, love, and the eternal promise of redemption through Christ's sacrifice.
