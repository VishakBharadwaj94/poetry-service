## Disabled by Wilfred Owen

```
He sat in a wheeled chair, waiting for dark,
And shivered in his ghastly suit of grey,
Legless, sewn short at elbow.  Through the park
Voices of boys rang saddening like a hymn,
Voices of play and pleasure after day,
Till gathering sleep had mothered them from him.

About this time Town used to swing so gay
When glow-lamps budded in the light-blue trees
And girls glanced lovelier as the air grew dim,
-- In the old times, before he threw away his knees.
Now he will never feel again how slim
Girls' waists are, or how warm their subtle hands,
All of them touch him like some queer disease.

There was an artist silly for his face,
For it was younger than his youth, last year.
Now he is old; his back will never brace;
He's lost his colour very far from here,
Poured it down shell-holes till the veins ran dry,
And half his lifetime lapsed in the hot race,
And leap of purple spurted from his thigh.
One time he liked a bloodsmear down his leg,
After the matches carried shoulder-high.
It was after football, when he'd drunk a peg,
He thought he'd better join.  He wonders why . . .
Someone had said he'd look a god in kilts.

That's why; and maybe, too, to please his Meg,
Aye, that was it, to please the giddy jilts,
He asked to join.  He didn't have to beg;
Smiling they wrote his lie; aged nineteen years.
Germans he scarcely thought of; and no fears
Of Fear came yet.  He thought of jewelled hilts
For daggers in plaid socks; of smart salutes;
And care of arms; and leave; and pay arrears;
Esprit de corps; and hints for young recruits.
And soon, he was drafted out with drums and cheers.

Some cheered him home, but not as crowds cheer Goal.
Only a solemn man who brought him fruits
Thanked him; and then inquired about his soul.
Now, he will spend a few sick years in Institutes,
And do what things the rules consider wise,
And take whatever pity they may dole.
To-night he noticed how the women's eyes
Passed from him to the strong men that were whole.
How cold and late it is!  Why don't they come
And put him into bed?  Why don't they come?
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

This poem is written in free verse, lacking a consistent rhyme scheme or meter. The lack of a formal structure mirrors the chaotic and fragmented experience of the disabled soldier the poem portrays. The enjambment in the lines creates a sense of disjointedness, reflecting the disjointed life of the soldier after his injury. The irregular line lengths and lack of rhyme scheme contribute to the overall feeling of unease and disconnection in the poem.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem is the devastating impact of war on the individual, specifically focusing on the physical and emotional trauma experienced by a disabled soldier. The imagery in the poem is vivid and poignant, painting a stark picture of the soldier's suffering. The image of the soldier sitting in a wheeled chair, shivering in a grey suit, highlights his physical disability and isolation. The contrast between the past, when the town was lively and the soldier was whole, and the present, where he is abandoned and forgotten, underscores the theme of loss and disillusionment.

### Literary Devices

One of the key literary devices used in this poem is irony. The soldier's decision to join the war out of vanity and a desire to impress a girl, only to end up disabled and abandoned, is a tragic irony that highlights the senselessness of war. The imagery of the soldier pouring his color down shell-holes and the leap of purple from his thigh vividly conveys the physical toll of war. Owen also employs simile in the comparison of the voices of boys to a "hymn," emphasizing the loss of innocence and youth.

### Historical and Personal Context

Wilfred Owen was a British poet who served as a soldier in World War I, experiencing the horrors of trench warfare firsthand. "Disabled" draws on Owen's own experiences and observations of the devastating effects of war on young men. The poem reflects the disillusionment and despair felt by many soldiers who returned from the war physically and mentally scarred, only to find themselves forgotten and marginalized by society.

### Deep Reading

At a deeper level, "Disabled" explores the themes of identity, masculinity, and the dehumanizing effects of war. The soldier's loss of limbs and youth symbolizes the loss of his sense of self and his place in society. The poem challenges traditional notions of heroism and patriotism, portraying war as a destructive force that strips individuals of their humanity. The soldier's plea at the end of the poem, wondering why no one will come and put him to bed, highlights the profound loneliness and alienation experienced by those who have been broken by war.

In conclusion, Wilfred Owen's "Disabled" is a powerful and haunting portrayal of the physical and emotional devastation wrought by war. Through its vivid imagery, ironic twists, and poignant themes, the poem sheds light on the human cost of conflict and the lasting impact it has on individuals.

## The Laboratory (Ancien Regime) by Robert Browning

```
Now that I, tying thy glass mask tightly,
May gaze through these faint smokes curling whitely,
As thou pliest thy trade in this devil's-smithy--
Which is the poison to poison her, prithee?

He is with her, and they know that I know
Where they are, what they do: they believe my tears flow
While they laugh, laugh at me, at me fled to the drear
Empty church, to pray God in, for them!--I am here!

Grind away, moisten and mash up thy paste,
Pound at thy powder, I am not in haste!
Better sit thus and observe thy strange things,
Than go where men wait me, and dance at the King's.

That in the mortar--you call it a gum?
Ah, the brave tree whence such gold oozings come!
And yonder soft phial, the exquisite blue,
Sure to taste sweetly,--is that poison, too?
Had I but all of them, thee and thy treasures,
What a wild crowd of Invisible pleasures!
To carry pure death in an earring, a casket,
A signet, a fan-mount, a filigree basket!

Soon, at the King's, a mere lozenge to give
And Pauline should have just thirty minutes to live!
But to light a pastille, and Elise, with her head
And her breast and her arms and her hands, should drop dead!

Quick--is it finished? The colour's too grim!
Why not soft like the phial's, enticing and dim?
Let it brighten her drink, let her turn it and stir,
And try it and taste, ere she fix and prefer!

What a drop! She's not little, no minion like me!
That's why she ensnared him: this never will free
The soul from those masculine eyes,--say "No!"
To that pulse's magnificent come-and-go.

For only last night, as they whispered, I brought
My own eyes to bear on her so that I thought
Could I keep them one half-minute fixed, she would fall
Shrivelled; she fell not: yet this does it all!

Not that I bid you spare her the pain;
Let death be felt and the proof remain:
Brand, burn up, bite into its grace--
He is sure to remember her dying face!

Is it done? Take my mask off! Nay, be not morose;
It kills her, and this prevents seeing it close:
The delicate droplet, my whole fortune's fee!
If it hurts her, beside, can it ever hurt me?

Now, take all my jewels, gorge gold to your fill,
You may kiss me, old man, on my mouth if you will!
But brush this dust off me, lest horror it brings
Ere I know it--next moment I dance at the King's!
```

The poem consists of 35 lines divided into seven stanzas, each with a varying number of lines. The irregular stanza length contributes to the irregularity and intensity of the speaker's emotions.

In terms of meter, the poem does not strictly adhere to a consistent metrical pattern, but it does contain moments of iambic tetrameter and trimeter. For example, in the lines, "Is it done? Take my mask off! Nay, be not morose;" and "The delicate droplet, my whole fortune's fee!" The irregular meter adds to the sense of urgency and unease conveyed by the speaker.

The rhyme scheme in the poem is ABAB for most of the stanzas, with occasional variations. This consistent rhyme scheme helps to create a sense of cohesion and musicality in the poem.

### Themes and Imagery
The poem explores themes of jealousy, revenge, and obsession. The speaker's intense jealousy towards a woman who has ensnared their lover drives them to seek revenge by poisoning her. The imagery in the poem is vivid and macabre, with references to poison, death, and intricate details of the laboratory setting. The speaker's fixation on the process of creating and administering the poison reflects their twisted mindset and single-minded focus on revenge.

The imagery of the laboratory, with its "strange things" and "exquisite blue" phial, creates a sense of mystery and danger. The speaker's obsession with the poisonous substances and their desire for control over life and death is conveyed through the detailed descriptions of the ingredients and their effects.

### Literary Devices
Browning uses several literary devices to enhance the dramatic and emotional impact of the poem. One prominent device is dramatic irony, where the speaker reveals their sinister intentions while the targets of their plot remain unaware. This creates tension and suspense for the reader as they anticipate the unfolding of the speaker's plan.

The poem also employs imagery to evoke a sense of darkness and foreboding. The references to "devil's-smithy," "pure death in an earring," and "brand, burn up, bite into its grace" create a chilling atmosphere that reflects the speaker's malevolent intentions.

Additionally, Browning uses enjambment to create a sense of urgency and momentum in the poem. The lines flow seamlessly from one to the next, mirroring the speaker's escalating emotions and actions.

### Historical and Personal Context
"The Laboratory" was written by Robert Browning during the Victorian era, a period marked by social and moral conservatism. The poem reflects the darker aspects of human nature, such as jealousy and revenge, which were often repressed or hidden in Victorian society. Browning's exploration of these themes would have been provocative and controversial at the time.

The speaker's obsession with control and power over others may also reflect Browning's personal experiences or observations of human behavior. The poem delves into the complexities of human emotions and the destructive consequences of unchecked jealousy.

### Deep Reading
On a deeper level, "The Laboratory" can be seen as a commentary on the destructive nature of jealousy and the lengths to which individuals will go to seek revenge. The speaker's fixation on revenge blinds them to the consequences of their actions, leading to a chilling portrayal of moral decay and corruption.

The poem raises questions about the nature of obsession and the boundaries between love and possession. The speaker's desire to control and manipulate others reveals a deep-seated insecurity and a lack of empathy for their victims. Browning challenges the reader to confront the darker aspects of human psychology and the destructive power of unchecked emotions.

Overall, "The Laboratory" is a haunting exploration of jealousy, revenge, and the corrupting influence of obsession. Browning's masterful use of form, structure, imagery, and literary devices creates a gripping and unsettling portrait of a mind consumed by darkness.

Giving a voice to its mysterious waves--
