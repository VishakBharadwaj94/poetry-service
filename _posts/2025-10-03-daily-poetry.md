## The Question by Percy Bysshe Shelley

```
I dreamed that, as I wandered by the way,
Bare Winter suddenly was changed to Spring,
And gentle odours led my steps astray,
Mixed with a sound of waters murmuring
Along a shelving bank of turf, which lay
Under a copse, and hardly dared to fling
Its green arms round the bosom of the stream,
But kissed it and then fled, as thou mightest in dream.

There grew pied wind-flowers and violets,
Daisies, those pearled Arcturi of the earth,
The constellated flower that never sets;
Faint oxslips; tender bluebells, at whose birth
The sod scarce heaved; and that tall flower that wets--
Like a child, half in tenderness and mirth--
Its mother's face with Heaven's collected tears,
When the low wind, its playmate's voice, it hears.

And in the warm hedge grew lush eglantine,
Green cowbind and the moonlight-coloured may,
And cherry-blossoms, and white cups, whose wine
Was the bright dew, yet drained not by the day;
And wild roses, and ivy serpentine,
With its dark buds and leaves, wandering astray;
And flowers azure, black, and streaked with gold,
Fairer than any wakened eyes behold.

And nearer to the river's trembling edge
There grew broad flag-flowers, purple pranked with white.
And starry river buds among the sedge,
And floating water-lilies, broad and bright,
Which lit the oak that overhung the hedge
With moonlight beams of their own watery light;
And bulrushes, and reeds of such deep green
As soothed the dazzled eye with sober sheen.

Methought that of these visionary flowers
I made a nosegay, bound in such a way
That the same hues, which in their natural bowers
Were mingled or opposed, the like array
Kept these imprisoned children of the Hours
Within my hand,--and then, elate and gay,
I hastened to the spot whence I had come,
That I might there present it!--Oh! to whom?

In terms of form, Percy Bysshe Shelley's poem "The Question" consists of six stanzas, each with varying numbers of lines. The first stanza has eight lines, followed by four stanzas with ten lines each, and a final stanza with six lines. The irregular structure of the stanzas gives the poem a sense of fluidity and freedom, mirroring the natural imagery depicted within the verses.

The meter in the poem is primarily iambic, with lines alternating between tetrameter and pentameter. This rhythmic pattern creates a sense of ebb and flow, mimicking the movement of the natural world that the speaker describes. The rhyme scheme is ABABCC, with slight variations in some stanzas, adding to the overall musicality of the poem.

### Themes and Imagery

The central themes of "The Question" revolve around nature, beauty, transience, and the passage of time. Through vivid imagery, Shelley paints a picture of a dreamlike landscape bursting with vibrant flowers, lush vegetation, and flowing water. The transformation from winter to spring symbolizes rebirth and renewal, while the fleeting beauty of the flowers serves as a reminder of life's impermanence.

The imagery in the poem is rich and evocative, appealing to the senses and capturing the reader's imagination. From the "gentle odours" leading the speaker astray to the "starry river buds among the sedge," each detail enhances the natural beauty of the scene. The juxtaposition of delicate flowers and powerful elements like water and wind creates a sense of harmony and balance in the setting.

### Literary Devices

Shelley employs various literary devices throughout the poem to enhance its beauty and depth. One notable device is personification, as seen in lines like "Its green arms round the bosom of the stream" and "Its mother's face with Heaven's collected tears." By attributing human characteristics to nature, Shelley infuses the landscape with emotion and vitality.

Another prominent device is imagery, which plays a crucial role in conveying the themes of the poem. Descriptions of "moonlight beams" and "water-lilies, broad and bright" create vivid mental pictures for the reader, immersing them in the speaker's dreamlike experience. The use of sensory details like scent, touch, and color adds layers of texture to the imagery, making the natural world come alive on the page.

### Historical and Personal Context

Written during the Romantic era, Shelley's poem reflects the movement's emphasis on nature, emotion, and individual experience. The speaker's reverie in the midst of a lush, blooming landscape aligns with Romantic ideals of finding solace and inspiration in the natural world. Additionally, Shelley's own personal experiences of loss and longing may have influenced the themes of transience and beauty in the poem.

As a poet known for his radical views and unconventional lifestyle, Shelley's exploration of beauty and impermanence in "The Question" can be seen as a reflection of his own philosophical ponderings on life, love, and the passage of time. The poem's introspective tone and dreamlike imagery hint at deeper existential questions about the nature of existence and the fleeting nature of beauty.

### Deep Reading

At its core, "The Question" is not just a celebration of nature's beauty but also a meditation on the ephemeral nature of life itself. The speaker's act of gathering a bouquet of flowers, only to question whom to present it to, symbolizes the transient nature of beauty and the search for meaning in a fleeting world. The juxtaposition of vibrant, blooming flowers with the speaker's sense of uncertainty and introspection creates a poignant contrast that underscores the poem's deeper philosophical themes.

Through the lush imagery and introspective tone of "The Question," Shelley invites readers to contemplate the interconnectedness of beauty, mortality, and human experience. The dreamlike landscape serves as a backdrop for the speaker's existential musings, prompting us to reflect on the impermanence of life and the eternal quest for meaning and connection in a world filled with fleeting beauty.

## Winter Song by Wilfred Owen

```
The browns, the olives, and the yellows died,
And were swept up to heaven; where they glowed
Each dawn and set of sun till Christmastide,
And when the land lay pale for them, pale-snowed,
Fell back, and down the snow-drifts flamed and flowed.

From off your face, into the winds of winter,
The sun-brown and the summer-gold are blowing;
But they shall gleam with spiritual glinter,
When paler beauty on your brows falls snowing,
And through those snows my looks shall be soft-going.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme
In terms of form, "Winter Song" by Wilfred Owen is a sonnet, consisting of fourteen lines. The poem follows the typical rhyme scheme of an English sonnet, ABABCDCDEFEFGG. The poem is divided into two quatrains and a sestet, with a volta or shift in tone occurring at the ninth line. The meter is iambic pentameter, with five stressed syllables per line.

### Themes and Imagery
The central theme of "Winter Song" is the cycle of seasons and the passage of time. The poet uses vivid imagery to convey the changing landscapes of winter, with the browns, olives, and yellows of autumn fading away and being replaced by the whiteness of snow. The imagery of the sun-brown and summer-gold blowing into the winds of winter symbolizes the fleeting nature of beauty and life. The poem also explores themes of beauty, transformation, and the inevitability of change.

### Literary Devices
One of the key literary devices used in the poem is personification, where the colors of autumn are described as dying, being swept up to heaven, and glowing in the sky. This personification adds a sense of movement and life to the changing seasons. Owen also employs imagery, particularly in the description of snow-drifts flaming and flowing, to create a vivid sensory experience for the reader. The poet uses alliteration in "snow-drifts flamed and flowed" to create a rhythmic effect and emphasize the movement of the snow.

### Historical and Personal Context
Wilfred Owen was a British poet who served as a soldier in World War I, and his poetry often reflects his experiences in the war. While "Winter Song" does not directly reference the war, Owen's personal context as a soldier who witnessed the devastation of battle may have influenced his themes of transformation and the passage of time. The poem was likely written during Owen's time in the trenches, where he would have experienced the harsh realities of winter firsthand.

### Deep Reading
On a deeper level, "Winter Song" can be seen as a meditation on the transience of beauty and the inevitability of change. The poem suggests that just as the colors of autumn fade and give way to winter, so too will youth and beauty eventually pass. However, there is also a sense of hope and renewal in the imagery of snow falling softly on the brow, symbolizing a new beginning or transformation. The poem can be interpreted as a reflection on the cycles of life and the beauty that can be found even in the midst of winter's cold.

## Pine-Trees and the Sky: Evening by Rupert Brooke

```
I'd watched the sorrow of the evening sky,
And smelt the sea, and earth, and the warm clover,
And heard the waves, and the seagull's mocking cry.

And in them all was only the old cry,
That song they always sing -- "The best is over!
You may remember now, and think, and sigh,
O silly lover!"
And I was tired and sick that all was over,
And because I,
For all my thinking, never could recover
One moment of the good hours that were over.
And I was sorry and sick, and wished to die.

Then from the sad west turning wearily,
I saw the pines against the white north sky,
Very beautiful, and still, and bending over
Their sharp black heads against a quiet sky.
And there was peace in them; and I
Was happy, and forgot to play the lover,
And laughed, and did no longer wish to die;
Being glad of you, O pine-trees and the sky!
```
