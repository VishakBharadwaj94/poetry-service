## Encouraged by Paul Laurence Dunbar

Because you love me I have much achieved,
Had you despised me then I must have failed,
But since I knew you trusted and believed,
I could not disappoint you and so prevailed.

## Sonnet: I said I splendidly loved you; it's not true by Rupert Brooke

```
I said I splendidly loved you; it's not true.
Such long swift tides stir not a land-locked sea.
On gods or fools the high risk falls -- on you --
The clean clear bitter-sweet that's not for me.
Love soars from earth to ecstasies unwist.
Love is flung Lucifer-like from Heaven to Hell.
But -- there are wanderers in the middle mist,
Who cry for shadows, clutch, and cannot tell
Whether they love at all, or, loving, whom:
An old song's lady, a fool in fancy dress,
Or phantoms, or their own face on the gloom;
For love of Love, or from heart's loneliness.
Pleasure's not theirs, nor pain. They doubt, and sigh,
And do not love at all. Of these am I.
```

The use of alliteration in "clean clear bitter-sweet" emphasizes the conflicting emotions associated with love. The reference to "phantoms" and "own face on the gloom" suggests a sense of self-deception and illusion in matters of the heart.

Overall, the poem presents a nuanced exploration of love as a multifaceted and often elusive emotion.

## Insensibility by Wilfred Owen

```
I

Happy are men who yet before they are killed
Can let their veins run cold.
Whom no compassion fleers
Or makes their feet
Sore on the alleys cobbled with their brothers.
The front line withers,
But they are troops who fade, not flowers
For poets' tearful fooling:
Men, gaps for filling
Losses who might have fought
Longer; but no one bothers.


    II

And some cease feeling
Even themselves or for themselves.
Dullness best solves
The tease and doubt of shelling,
And Chance's strange arithmetic
Comes simpler than the reckoning of their shilling.
They keep no check on Armies' decimation.


    III

Happy are these who lose imagination:
They have enough to carry with ammunition.
Their spirit drags no pack.
Their old wounds save with cold can not more ache.
Having seen all things red,
Their eyes are rid
Of the hurt of the colour of blood for ever.
And terror's first constriction over,
Their hearts remain small drawn.
Their senses in some scorching cautery of battle
Now long since ironed,
Can laugh among the dying, unconcerned.


    IV

Happy the soldier home, with not a notion
How somewhere, every dawn, some men attack,
And many sighs are drained.
Happy the lad whose mind was never trained:
His days are worth forgetting more than not.
He sings along the march
Which we march taciturn, because of dusk,
The long, forlorn, relentless trend
From larger day to huger night.


    V

We wise, who with a thought besmirch
Blood over all our soul,
How should we see our task
But through his blunt and lashless eyes?
Alive, he is not vital overmuch;
Dying, not mortal overmuch;
Nor sad, nor proud,
Nor curious at all.
He cannot tell
Old men's placidity from his.


    VI

But cursed are dullards whom no cannon stuns,
That they should be as stones.
Wretched are they, and mean
With paucity that never was simplicity.
By choice they made themselves immune
To pity and whatever mourns in man
Before the last sea and the hapless stars;
Whatever mourns when many leave these shores;
Whatever shares
The eternal reciprocity of tears.
```

### Analysis

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

Wilfred Owen's poem "Insensibility" is structured in six stanzas, each with varying lengths ranging from four to nine lines. The irregular stanza lengths contribute to the fragmented and disjointed feeling of the poem, mirroring the fragmented experiences of war. The poem is written in free verse, with no consistent rhyme scheme, emphasizing the chaotic and unpredictable nature of war.

The lack of a regular meter adds to the sense of unease and discordance in the poem. Owen's use of enjambment, where sentences and thoughts continue from one line to the next without punctuation, creates a sense of urgency and momentum, reflecting the relentless march of soldiers into battle. The lack of traditional rhyme and meter also underscores the harsh realities of war, highlighting the absence of order and stability in the face of violence and destruction.

### Themes and Imagery

One of the central themes in "Insensibility" is the idea of emotional numbness and desensitization to the horrors of war. Owen explores how soldiers become detached from their own emotions and the suffering of others in order to survive the trauma of combat. This theme is illustrated through vivid and visceral imagery, such as "The front line withers,/But they are troops who fade, not flowers," highlighting the contrast between the soldiers' fading humanity and the withering of nature in the face of war.

The poem also delves into the loss of imagination and empathy that comes with war, portraying a bleak picture of soldiers who have become immune to the pain and suffering around them. Owen uses striking imagery, such as "Their eyes are rid/Of the hurt of the colour of blood for ever," to convey the emotional numbness and detachment experienced by those who have been desensitized by the brutality of battle.

### Literary Devices

Owen employs a variety of literary devices in "Insensibility" to convey the harsh realities of war and the emotional toll it takes on soldiers. One notable device is irony, as Owen presents the idea of insensitivity as a form of survival, despite its dehumanizing effects. The poem also features vivid imagery, such as "scorching cautery of battle," which evokes the physical and emotional pain of war.

Owen's use of repetition, as seen in the repeated use of the word "happy" throughout the poem, serves to emphasize the contrast between society's perception of war and the grim reality faced by soldiers on the front lines. The repetition of certain phrases and images adds to the poem's haunting and relentless tone, underscoring the psychological toll of war on those who experience it firsthand.

### Historical and Personal Context

As a soldier in World War I, Wilfred Owen drew on his own experiences and observations of the battlefield to write poems that captured the brutality and futility of war. "Insensibility" reflects Owen's firsthand knowledge of the emotional numbness and desensitization that often accompanied the trauma of combat. The poem exposes the psychological toll of war on soldiers, highlighting the dehumanizing effects of violence and death.

Owen's personal experiences as a soldier greatly influenced his poetry, as he sought to convey the harsh realities of war to a civilian audience. Through his work, Owen aimed to challenge romanticized notions of war and expose the true horrors faced by those on the front lines. "Insensibility" serves as a powerful critique of the emotional detachment and desensitization that war can inflict on those who endure its hardships.

### Deep Reading

"Insensibility" delves into the paradoxical nature of survival in the midst of war, exploring the ways in which soldiers must detach themselves from their own emotions and the suffering of others in order to endure the brutality of combat. The poem exposes the psychological toll of war, depicting a world in which empathy and imagination are sacrificed in the name of self-preservation.

By juxtaposing the idea of insensitivity with the harsh realities of war, Owen challenges traditional notions of heroism and sacrifice, highlighting the dehumanizing effects of violence and trauma. Through vivid imagery and stark language, Owen paints a bleak portrait of soldiers who have been stripped of their humanity by the horrors of war, underscoring the psychological cost of conflict on both individuals and society as a whole.
