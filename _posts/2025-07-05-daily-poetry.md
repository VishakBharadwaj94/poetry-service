## One Word More: To E.B.B. by Robert Browning

```
There they are, my fifty men and women
Naming me the fifty poems finished!
Take them, Love, the book and me together;
Where the heart lies, let the brain lie also.

Rafael made a century of sonnets,
Made and wrote them in a certain volume
Dinted with the silver-pointed pencil
Else he only used to draw Madonnas;
These, the world might view--but one, the volume.
Who that one, you ask? Your heart instructs you.
Did she live and love it all her lifetime?
Did she drop, his lady of the sonnets,
Die, and let it drop beside her pillow
Where it lay in place of Rafael's glory,
Rafael's cheek so duteous and so loving--
Cheek, the world was wont to hail a painter's,
Rafael's cheek, her love had turned a poet's?

You and I would rather read that volume
(Taken to his beating bosom by it),
Lean and list the bosom-beats of Rafael,
Would we not? than wonder at Madonnas--
Her, San Sisto names, and Her, Foligno,
Her, that visits Florence in a vision,
Her, that's left with lilies in the Louvre--
Seen by us and all the world in circle.

You and I will never read that volume.
Guido Reni, like his own eye's apple,
Guarded long the treasure-book and loved it.
Guido Reni dying, all Bologna
Cried, and the world cried too, "Ours, the treasure!"
Suddenly, as rare things will, it vanished.

Dante once prepared to paint an angel:
Whom to please? You whisper "Beatrice."
While he mused and traced it and retraced it
(Peradventure with a pen corroded
Still by drops of that hot ink he dipped for,
When, his left-hand i' the hair o' the wicked,
Back he held the brow and pricked its stigma,
Bit into the live man's flesh for parchment,
Loosed him, laughed to see the writing rankle,
Let the wretch go festering through Florence)--
Dante, who loved well because he hated,
Hated wickedness that hinders loving,
Dante, standing, studying his angel,--
In there broke the folk of his Inferno.
Says he--"Certain people of importance"
(Such he gave his daily dreadful line to)
"Entered and would seize, forsooth, the poet."
Says the poet--"Then I stopped my painting."

You and I would rather see that angel,
Painted by the tenderness of Dante,
Would we not?--than read a fresh Inferno.

You and I will never see that picture.
While he mused on love and Beatrice,
While he softened o'er his outlined angel,
In they broke, those "people of importance":
We and Bice bear the loss forever.

What of Rafael's sonnets, Dante's picture?
This: no artist lives and loves, that longs not
Once, and only once, and for one only,
(Ah, the prize!) to find his love a language
Fit and fair and simple and sufficient--
Using nature that's an art to others,
Not, this one time, art that's turned his nature.
Ay, of all the artists living, loving,
None but would forego his proper dowry,--
Does he paint? he fain would write a poem,
Does he write? he fain would paint a picture,--
Put to proof art alien to the artist's,
Once, and only once, and for one only,
So to be the man and leave the artist,
Gain the man's joy, miss the artist's sorrow.

Wherefore? Heaven's gift takes earth's abatement!
He who smites the rock and spreads the water,
Bidding drink and live a crowd beneath him,
Even he, the minute makes immortal,
Proves, perchance, but mortal in the minute,
Desecrates, belike, the deed in doing.
While he smites, how can he but remember,
So he smote before, in such a peril,
When they stood and mocked--"Shall smiting help us?"
When they drank and sneered--"A stroke is easy!"
When they wiped their mouths and went their journey,
Throwing him for thanks--"But drought was pleasant."
Thus old memories mar the actual triumph;
Thus the doing savors of disrelish;
Thus achievement lacks a gracious somewhat;
O'er-importuned brows becloud the mandate,
Carelessness or consciousness--the gesture.
For he bears an ancient wrong about him,
Sees and knows again those phalanxed faces,
Hears, yet one time more, the 'customed prelude--
"How shouldst thou, of all men, smite, and save us?"
Guesses what is like to prove the sequel--
"Egypt's flesh-pots--nay, the drought was better."

Oh, the crowd must have emphatic warrant!
Theirs, the Sinai-forhead's cloven brilliance,
Right-arm's rod-sweep, tongue's imperial fiat.
Never dares the man put off the prophet.

Did he love one face from out the thousands,
(Were she Jethro's daughter, white and wifely,
Were she but the Ã†thiopian bondslave),
He would envy yon dumb, patient camel,
Keeping a reserve of scanty water
Meant to save his own life in the desert;
Ready in the desert to deliver
(Kneeling down to let his breast be opened)
Hoard and life together for his mistress.

I shall never, in the years remaining,
Paint you pictures, no, nor carve you statues.
Make you music that should all-express me;
So it seems; I stand on my attainment.
This of verse alone, one life allows me;
Verse and nothing else have I to give you;
Other heights in other lives, God willing;
All the gifts from all the heights, your own, Love.

Yet a semblance of resource avails us--
Shade so finely touched, love's sense must seize it.
Take these lines, look lovingly and nearly,
Lines I write the first time and the last time.
He who works in fresco steals a hair-brush,
Curbs the liberal hand, subservient proudly,
Cramps his spirit, crowds its all in little,
Makes a strange art of an art familiar,
Fills his lady's missal-marge with flowerets,
He who blows through bronze may breathe through silver,
Fitly serenade a slumbrous princess.
He who writes, may write for once as I do.

Love, you saw me gather men and women,
Live or dead or fashioned by my fancy,
Enter each and all, and use their service,
Speak from every mouth,--the speech, a poem.
Hardly shall I tell my joys and sorrows,
Hopes and fears, belief and disbelieving:
I am mine and yours--the rest be all men's,
Karshish, Cleon, Norbert, and the fifty.
Let me speak this once in my true person,
Not as Lippo, Roland, or Andrea,
Though the fruit of speech be just this sentence:
Pray you, look on these my men and women,
Take and keep my fifty poems finished;
Where my heart lies, let my brain lie also!
Poor the speech; be how I speak, for all things.

Not but that you know me! Lo, the moon's self!
Here in London, yonder late in Florence,
Still we find her face, the thrice-transfigured.
Curving on a sky imbrued with color,
Drifted over Fiesole by twilight,
Came she, our new crescent of a hair's-breadth.
Full she flared it, lamping Samminiato,
Rounder 'twixt the cypresses and rounder,
Perfect till the nightingales applauded.
Now, a piece of her old self, impoverished,
Hard to greet, she traverses the house-roofs,
Hurries with unhandsome thrift of silver,
Goes dispiritedly, glad to finish.

What, there's nothing in the moon noteworthy?
Nay: for if that moon could love a mortal,
Use, to charm him (so to fit a fancy),
All her magic ('tis the old sweet mythos),
She would turn a new side to her mortal,
Side unseen of herdsman, huntsman, steersman,--
Blank to Zoroaster on his terrace,
Blind to Galileo on his turret.
Dumb to Homer, dumb to Keats--him, even!
Think, the wonder of the moonstruck mortal--
When she turns round, comes again in heaven,
Opens out anew for worse or better!
Proves she like some portent of an iceberg
Swimming full upon the ship it founders,
Hungry with huge teeth of splintered crystals?
Proves she as the paved work of a sapphire,
Seen by Moses when he climbed the mountain?
Moses, Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu
Climbed and saw the very God, the Highest,
Stand upon the paved work of a sapphire.
Like the bodied heaven in his clearness
Shone the stone, the sapphire of that paved work,
When they ate and drank and saw God also!

What were seen? None knows, none ever will know.
Only this is sure--the sight were other,
Not the moon's same side, born late in Florence,
Dying now impoverished here in London.
God be thanked, the meanest of his creatures
Boasts two soul-sides, one to face the world with,
One to show a woman when he loves her.

This I say of me, but think of you, Love!
This to you--yourself my moon of poets!
Ah, but that's the world's side, there's the wonder,
Thus they see you, praise you, think they know you!
There, in turn I stand with them and praise you--
Out of my own self, I dare to phrase it.
But the best is when I glide from out them,
Cross a step or two of dubious twilight,
Come out on the other side, the novel
Silent silver lights and darks undreamed of,
Where I hush and bless myself with silence.

Oh, their Rafael of the dear Madonnas,
Oh, their Dante of the dread Inferno,
Wrote one song--and in my brain I sing it,
Drew one angel--borne, see, on my bosom!
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

Robert Browning's poem "One Word More: To E.B.B." is written in blank verse, meaning it does not adhere to a specific rhyme scheme.

### Literary Devices

Browning employs a variety of literary devices to enhance the depth and complexity of the poem. These include allusions to historical and literary figures, such as Rafael, Dante, Moses, and Keats, to underscore the idea that all artists grapple with similar challenges and desires. The use of personification, as seen in the moon's ability to love a mortal and change its appearance, adds a mystical and ethereal quality to the poem. Browning also utilizes imagery, symbolism, and metaphor to explore the nuanced relationship between art, love, and the artist's innermost thoughts and feelings.

## Insensibility by Wilfred Owen

```
I

Happy are men who yet before they are killed
Can let their veins run cold.
Whom no compassion fleers
Or makes their feet
Sore on the alleys cobbled with their brothers.
The front line withers,
But they are troops who fade, not flowers
For poets' tearful fooling:
Men, gaps for filling
Losses who might have fought
Longer; but no one bothers.


    II

And some cease feeling
Even themselves or for themselves.
Dullness best solves
The tease and doubt of shelling,
And Chance's strange arithmetic
Comes simpler than the reckoning of their shilling.
They keep no check on Armies' decimation.


    III

Happy are these who lose imagination:
They have enough to carry with ammunition.
Their spirit drags no pack.
Their old wounds save with cold can not more ache.
Having seen all things red,
Their eyes are rid
Of the hurt of the colour of blood for ever.
And terror's first constriction over,
Their hearts remain small drawn.
Their senses in some scorching cautery of battle
Now long since ironed,
Can laugh among the dying, unconcerned.


    IV

Happy the soldier home, with not a notion
How somewhere, every dawn, some men attack,
And many sighs are drained.
Happy the lad whose mind was never trained:
His days are worth forgetting more than not.
He sings along the march
Which we march taciturn, because of dusk,
The long, forlorn, relentless trend
From larger day to huger night.


    V

We wise, who with a thought besmirch
Blood over all our soul,
How should we see our task
But through his blunt and lashless eyes?
Alive, he is not vital overmuch;
Dying, not mortal overmuch;
Nor sad, nor proud,
Nor curious at all.
He cannot tell
Old men's placidity from his.


    VI

But cursed are dullards whom no cannon stuns,
That they should be as stones.
Wretched are they, and mean
With paucity that never was simplicity.
By choice they made themselves immune
To pity and whatever mourns in man
Before the last sea and the hapless stars;
Whatever mourns when many leave these shores;
Whatever shares
The eternal reciprocity of tears.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "Insensibility" by Wilfred Owen is written in six stanzas, each exploring different aspects of the emotional detachment and desensitization experienced by soldiers in war. The poem is free verse, lacking a strict rhyme scheme or meter. This lack of regularity in form mirrors the chaotic and unpredictable nature of war, emphasizing the disorientation and emotional numbness of the soldiers. The absence of rhyme also adds to the raw and stark tone of the poem, highlighting the harsh realities faced by those on the front lines.

### Themes and Imagery

One of the central themes in the poem is the dehumanizing effect of war on soldiers. Owen explores how the constant exposure to violence and death leads to a loss of empathy and emotional connection. The imagery in the poem is striking and vivid, with references to blood, wounds, and death creating a sense of horror and desolation. The soldiers are depicted as emotionless and detached, their spirits worn down by the relentless brutality of battle. The contrast between the happy ignorance of those at home and the numbness of those on the front lines serves to highlight the psychological toll of war.

### Literary Devices

Owen employs various literary devices to convey the emotional numbness and detachment experienced by soldiers in war. One such device is irony, as seen in lines like "Happy are men who yet before they are killed / Can let their veins run cold." This juxtaposition of happiness and cold-bloodedness underscores the absurdity of finding peace in numbness. Owen also uses vivid imagery, such as "The front line withers, / But they are troops who fade, not flowers," to evoke the bleak and desolate landscape of war. The repetition of the word "happy" throughout the poem serves to emphasize the twisted nature of the soldiers' contentment in their emotional detachment.

### Historical and Personal Context

Wilfred Owen was a soldier in World War I, and his firsthand experiences of the horrors of war deeply influenced his poetry. "Insensibility" reflects the disillusionment and trauma faced by soldiers during the conflict, capturing the psychological toll of warfare on the human spirit. Owen himself suffered from shell shock and was ultimately killed in battle, adding a poignant layer of personal context to his exploration of the dehumanizing effects of war.

### Deep Reading

Through "Insensibility," Wilfred Owen delves into the psychological complexities of war, shedding light on the emotional numbness and detachment that can result from prolonged exposure to violence and death. The poem challenges traditional notions of heroism and sacrifice, portraying the soldiers not as noble warriors but as emotionally drained and desensitized individuals. Owen's use of stark imagery and irony forces the reader to confront the harsh realities of war and the toll it takes on the human psyche. Ultimately, "Insensibility" serves as a powerful critique of the glorification of war and a poignant reminder of the profound human cost of conflict.

## Common Things by Paul Laurence Dunbar

```
I like to hear of wealth and gold,
And El Doradoes in their glory;
I like for silks and satins bold
To sweep and rustle through a story.

The nightingale is sweet of song;
The rare exotic smells divinely;
And knightly men who stride along,
The role heroic carry finely.

But then, upon the other hand,
Our minds have got a way of running
To things that aren't quite so grand,
Which, maybe, we are best in shunning.

For some of us still like to see
The poor man in his dwelling narrow,
The hollyhock, the bumblebee,
The meadow lark, and chirping sparrow.

We like the man who soars and sings
With high and lofty inspiration;
But he who sings of common things
Shall always share our admiration.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "Common Things" by Paul Laurence Dunbar is written in a structured form with a consistent rhyme scheme. It consists of four quatrains, with each stanza following an ABAB rhyme scheme.

The meter of the poem is primarily iambic, with lines alternating between tetrameter and trimeter, creating a rhythmic flow that adds to the musicality of the poem.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem revolves around the contrast between the grandeur of wealth, luxury, and exoticism, and the simplicity of everyday life and nature. The speaker expresses a preference for the common, ordinary things over the extravagant and heroic. Through vivid imagery, Dunbar paints a picture of opulence with references to wealth, gold, silks, and knightly men, juxtaposed with images of the poor man's dwelling, hollyhocks, bumblebees, meadow larks, and sparrows. This contrast highlights the beauty and value of the mundane and ordinary aspects of life.

### Literary Devices

Dunbar employs various literary devices to enhance the poem's meaning and emotional impact. Alliteration is used in phrases like "silks and satins bold" and "meadow lark, and chirping sparrow," adding musicality and emphasis to these images. The use of juxtaposition, comparing grandeur with simplicity, creates a powerful contrast that underscores the speaker's preference for common things. Additionally, the repetition of the word "like" at the beginning of several lines emphasizes the speaker's personal preferences and reinforces the central theme of the poem.

### Historical and Personal Context

Paul Laurence Dunbar, an African American poet, often explored themes of race, identity, and social inequality in his work. In "Common Things," Dunbar may be reflecting on his own experiences and perspective as a marginalized individual in a society that often values wealth and status over simplicity and commonality. The poem can be seen as a commentary on societal values and the importance of appreciating the beauty in everyday life, regardless of one's socioeconomic status.

### Deep Reading

At its core, "Common Things" celebrates the beauty and significance of ordinary moments and experiences. While the world may be enamored with wealth and grandeur, the speaker finds solace and admiration in the common man and the simple pleasures of nature. By elevating the value of everyday life, Dunbar challenges societal norms and encourages readers to find joy and inspiration in the commonplace. The poem serves as a reminder to appreciate the beauty that surrounds us and to find value in the mundane, ultimately advocating for a more grounded and appreciative perspective on life.

## Today's Writing Challenge

**Form:** Rondeau

**Structure:** A thirteen-line poem with a specific rhyme scheme and refrain

**Rhyme Scheme:** AB/aAabAB

*Prompt: Write a rondeau about the bittersweet moment of watching a sunset, capturing the beauty of the sky turning shades of pink and orange, the feeling of peace and sadness as the day comes to an end.*

### Word Suggestions

Consider these word pairs that complement your poem's tone:

- **shut** (Germanic) / **close** (Latinate)
  - *While 'shut' carries a more abrupt and final connotation, 'close' is softer and more gentle. 'Shut' implies a sense of immediate action, while 'close' conveys a gradual transition. In the context of a sunset and the emotions it evokes, 'close' may be more fitting for its subtlety and reflective tone.*
  - **Recommended:** Use the latinate version to enhance your poem's tone

- **end** (Germanic) / **finish** (Latinate)
  - *'End' is more definitive and can feel more emotional, marking a clear conclusion. On the other hand, 'finish' is slightly more neutral and can imply completion without the same sense of finality. Considering the bittersweet theme of the poem, 'end' might resonate better with the conflicting emotions of beauty and sadness.*
  - **Recommended:** Use the germanic version to enhance your poem's tone

- **alive** (Germanic) / **animate** (Latinate)
  - *'Alive' has a vibrant and immediate quality, suggesting vitality and presence. In contrast, 'animate' has a more formal and intellectual tone, focusing on the concept of being alive rather than the feeling of vitality. For a poem about the beauty of nature and the emotions it stirs, 'alive' would be more evocative and engaging.*
  - **Recommended:** Use the germanic version to enhance your poem's tone
