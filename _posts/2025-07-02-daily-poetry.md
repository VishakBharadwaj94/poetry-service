## The pretty Rain from those sweet Eaves by Emily Dickinson

```
The pretty Rain from those sweet Eaves
Her unintending Eyes --
Took her own Heart, including ours,
By innocent Surprise --

The wrestle in her simple Throat
To hold the feeling down
That vanquished her -- defeated Feat --
Was Fervor's sudden Crown --

## At Home by Christina Rossetti

```
When I was dead, my spirit turned
To seek the much-frequented house:
I passed the door, and saw my friends
Feasting beneath green orange boughs;
From hand to hand they pushed the wine,
They sucked the pulp of plum and peach;
They sang, they jested, and they laughed,
For each was loved of each.

I listened to thier honest chat:
Said one: "To-morrow we shall be
Plod plod along the featureless sands,
And coasting miles and miles of sea."
Said one: "Before the turn of tide
We will achieve the eyrie-seat."
Said one: "To-morrow shall be like
To-day, but much more sweet."

"To-morrow," said they, strong with hope,
And dwelt upon the pleasant way:
"To-morrow," cried they, one and all,
While no one spoke of yesterday.
Their life stood full at blessed noon;
I, only I, had passed away:
"To-morrow and to-day," they cried;
I was of yesterday.

I shivered comfortless, but cast
No chill across the table-cloth;
I, all-forgotten, shivered, sad
To stay, and yet to part how loth:
I passed from the familiar room,
I who from love had passed away,
Like the remembrance of a guest
That tarrieth but a day.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

In terms of form, "At Home" by Christina Rossetti is a narrative poem consisting of four stanzas with varying line lengths. The poem does not adhere to a specific meter, giving it a free verse structure. The lack of a consistent rhyme scheme also adds to the informal and conversational tone of the poem. The irregular structure mirrors the protagonist's sense of displacement and isolation as they observe their friends enjoying life without them.

### Themes and Imagery

The central themes in the poem revolve around alienation, mortality, and the passage of time. The imagery of the friends feasting and enjoying themselves in a familiar house while the speaker, who is dead, watches from afar, highlights the theme of separation and the inability to participate in the joys of life. The use of vivid imagery such as "feasting beneath green orange boughs" and "sucked the pulp of plum and peach" creates a contrast between the liveliness of the friends and the speaker's sense of detachment.

### Literary Devices

Rossetti employs several literary devices to enhance the thematic elements of the poem. The repetition of the word "To-morrow" throughout the stanzas emphasizes the friends' optimism and anticipation for the future, contrasting with the speaker's sense of being stuck in the past. The use of personification, such as "I, only I, had passed away," gives a human quality to the abstract concept of death, emphasizing the speaker's isolation and longing to be remembered. Additionally, the metaphor of the speaker being "like the remembrance of a guest that tarrieth but a day" conveys a sense of fleeting existence and impermanence.

### Historical and Personal Context

Christina Rossetti was a Victorian poet known for her introspective and often melancholic themes. "At Home" reflects the Victorian fascination with death and the afterlife, as well as the societal emphasis on duty and self-sacrifice. Rossetti's personal experiences with loss and illness likely influenced her exploration of themes related to mortality and isolation in this poem.

### Deep Reading

"At Home" can be interpreted as a reflection on the ephemeral nature of life and the inevitability of death. The speaker's sense of isolation and longing to be remembered highlights the human desire for connection and immortality. The contrast between the friends' carefree enjoyment of the present moment and the speaker's existential despair serves as a poignant reminder of the transient nature of human existence. Ultimately, the poem underscores the bittersweet paradox of life - the simultaneous joy of living and the sorrow of knowing that one day, like the speaker, we will all be "of yesterday."

## Pine-Trees and the Sky: Evening by Rupert Brooke

```
I'd watched the sorrow of the evening sky,
And smelt the sea, and earth, and the warm clover,
And heard the waves, and the seagull's mocking cry.

And in them all was only the old cry,
That song they always sing -- "The best is over!
You may remember now, and think, and sigh,
O silly lover!"
And I was tired and sick that all was over,
And because I,
For all my thinking, never could recover
One moment of the good hours that were over.
And I was sorry and sick, and wished to die.

Then from the sad west turning wearily,
I saw the pines against the white north sky,
Very beautiful, and still, and bending over
Their sharp black heads against a quiet sky.
And there was peace in them; and I
Was happy, and forgot to play the lover,
And laughed, and did no longer wish to die;
Being glad of you, O pine-trees and the sky!
```
