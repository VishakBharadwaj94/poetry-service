## Lines Written In Early Spring by William Wordsworth

```
I heard a thousand blended notes,
While in a grove I sate reclined,
In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts
Bring sad thoughts to the mind.

To her fair works did Nature link
The human soul that through me ran;
And much it grieved my heart to think
What man has made of man.

Through primrose tufts, in that green bower,
The periwinkle trailed its wreaths;
And 'tis my faith that every flower
Enjoys the air it breathes.

The birds around me hopped and played,
Their thoughts I cannot measure:--
But the least motion which they made
It seemed a thrill of pleasure.

The budding twigs spread out their fan,
To catch the breezy air;
And I must think, do all I can,
That there was pleasure there.

If this belief from heaven be sent,
If such be Nature's holy plan,
Have I not reason to lament
What man has made of man?
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme
"Lines Written In Early Spring" by William Wordsworth is a lyrical ballad consisting of four quatrains. Each quatrain follows an ABAB rhyme scheme, contributing to the poem's musical and soothing quality. The poem is written in iambic tetrameter, with lines alternating between tetrameter and trimeter. This rhythmic pattern adds a sense of natural flow to the poem, mirroring the gentle and contemplative mood of the speaker.

### Themes and Imagery
The poem explores themes of nature, humanity, and the relationship between the two. Wordsworth uses vivid imagery to convey the beauty of the natural world, such as the "primrose tufts" and the birds "hopped and played." The contrast between the peacefulness of nature and the sadness in the speaker's mind highlights the impact of human actions on the environment. The imagery of flowers enjoying the air they breathe and birds experiencing pleasure in their movements emphasizes the harmony and joy present in the natural world.

### Literary Devices
Wordsworth employs several literary devices in the poem to enhance its meaning. Personification is used to attribute human-like qualities to nature, such as when the speaker suggests that flowers and birds experience pleasure. This technique emphasizes the interconnectedness between humans and the natural world. The poem also contains paradoxical imagery, such as the juxtaposition of pleasant and sad thoughts in the speaker's mind. This creates a sense of complexity and depth in the emotional landscape of the poem.

### Historical and Personal Context
William Wordsworth was a prominent figure in the Romantic literary movement, which celebrated nature, emotion, and individual experience. "Lines Written In Early Spring" reflects Wordsworth's belief in the spiritual and moral significance of nature. The poem was written during a period of industrialization and social upheaval in England, which influenced Wordsworth's concern for the impact of human progress on the environment. The poem can be seen as a response to the loss of connection to nature in the face of rapid industrialization.

### Deep Reading
At its core, "Lines Written In Early Spring" is a meditation on the relationship between humanity and the natural world. The speaker's contemplation of nature's beauty and harmony serves as a contrast to the destructive tendencies of human society. The poem conveys a sense of lamentation for the loss of innocence and purity in the world, as seen in the lines "What man has made of man." Wordsworth suggests that by reconnecting with nature and recognizing its intrinsic value, humans can rediscover a sense of fulfillment and spiritual nourishment. The poem serves as a poignant reminder of the importance of preserving the beauty and integrity of the natural world.

## Disabled by Wilfred Owen

```
He sat in a wheeled chair, waiting for dark,
And shivered in his ghastly suit of grey,
Legless, sewn short at elbow.  Through the park
Voices of boys rang saddening like a hymn,
Voices of play and pleasure after day,
Till gathering sleep had mothered them from him.

About this time Town used to swing so gay
When glow-lamps budded in the light-blue trees
And girls glanced lovelier as the air grew dim,
-- In the old times, before he threw away his knees.
Now he will never feel again how slim
Girls' waists are, or how warm their subtle hands,
All of them touch him like some queer disease.

There was an artist silly for his face,
For it was younger than his youth, last year.
Now he is old; his back will never brace;
He's lost his colour very far from here,
Poured it down shell-holes till the veins ran dry,
And half his lifetime lapsed in the hot race,
And leap of purple spurted from his thigh.
One time he liked a bloodsmear down his leg,
After the matches carried shoulder-high.
It was after football, when he'd drunk a peg,
He thought he'd better join.  He wonders why . . .
Someone had said he'd look a god in kilts.

That's why; and maybe, too, to please his Meg,
Aye, that was it, to please the giddy jilts,
He asked to join.  He didn't have to beg;
Smiling they wrote his lie; aged nineteen years.
Germans he scarcely thought of; and no fears
Of Fear came yet.  He thought of jewelled hilts
For daggers in plaid socks; of smart salutes;
And care of arms; and leave; and pay arrears;
Esprit de corps; and hints for young recruits.
And soon, he was drafted out with drums and cheers.

Some cheered him home, but not as crowds cheer Goal.
Only a solemn man who brought him fruits
Thanked him; and then inquired about his soul.
Now, he will spend a few sick years in Institutes,
And do what things the rules consider wise,
And take whatever pity they may dole.
To-night he noticed how the women's eyes
Passed from him to the strong men that were whole.
How cold and late it is!  Why don't they come
And put him into bed?  Why don't they come?
```

## Mid-ocean in War-time by Joyce Kilmer

```
(For My Mother)

The fragile splendour of the level sea,
The moon's serene and silver-veiled face,
Make of this vessel an enchanted place
Full of white mirth and golden sorcery.
Now, for a time, shall careless laughter be
Blended with song, to lend song sweeter grace,
And the old stars, in their unending race,
Shall heed and envy young humanity.
And yet to-night, a hundred leagues away,
These waters blush a strange and awful red.
Before the moon, a cloud obscenely grey
Rises from decks that crash with flying lead.
And these stars smile their immemorial way
On waves that shroud a thousand newly dead!
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme
The poem "Mid-ocean in War-time" by Joyce Kilmer consists of a single stanza with fourteen lines. It follows a traditional sonnet form, specifically a Petrarchan sonnet, with an octave (the first eight lines) and a sestet (the final six lines). The rhyme scheme of the octave is ABBAABBA, while the sestet follows a CDECDE pattern. This structured form allows Kilmer to explore contrasting themes and emotions within the poem.

In terms of meter, the poem employs iambic pentameter, with each line consisting of five metrical feet. This regular rhythm gives the poem a musical quality and helps to create a sense of flow and continuity throughout the piece.

### Themes and Imagery
The central themes of the poem revolve around the juxtaposition of beauty and horror, peace and violence, in the midst of wartime. The imagery used by Kilmer is striking and evocative, painting vivid pictures in the reader's mind. The "fragile splendour of the level sea" and the "moon's serene and silver-veiled face" create a sense of tranquility and enchantment. This imagery is contrasted with the unsettling image of "waters blush[ing] a strange and awful red" and "decks that crash with flying lead," depicting the harsh realities of war.

The poem also explores the themes of youth and mortality, as seen in the contrast between "young humanity" enjoying laughter and song on the vessel and the "thousand newly dead" shrouded in the waves. Kilmer's use of imagery effectively conveys the fragility of life and the impact of war on both the living and the dead.

### Literary Devices
Kilmer employs several literary devices to enhance the meaning and impact of the poem. One such device is personification, as seen in the lines "And the old stars, in their unending race, / Shall heed and envy young humanity." Here, the stars are given human-like qualities, highlighting the fleeting nature of life and the contrast between the eternal stars and mortal humans.

The poem also features symbolism, with the sea representing both beauty and danger, and the moon symbolizing serenity and peace. These symbolic elements deepen the thematic exploration of the poem and add layers of meaning for the reader to interpret.

Additionally, Kilmer uses vivid imagery, such as the "cloud obscenely grey" and the stars "smil[ing] their immemorial way," to evoke strong emotions and create a sense of atmosphere within the poem.

### Historical and Personal Context
Written during World War I, a period of intense conflict and devastation, the poem reflects the impact of war on individuals and society. Kilmer himself served in the war and tragically lost his life in combat, lending a personal context to the themes of the poem. The contrast between beauty and horror, peace and violence, likely reflects Kilmer's own experiences and observations during wartime.

The poem also speaks to the universal human experience of facing mortality and grappling with the realities of war. By exploring these themes through vivid imagery and emotional language, Kilmer invites readers to reflect on the human cost of conflict and the fragility of life.

### Deep Reading
Through "Mid-ocean in War-time," Joyce Kilmer invites readers to confront the paradox of beauty existing alongside violence, and peace coexisting with war. The structured form of the sonnet allows Kilmer to explore these contrasting themes in a nuanced and layered way, with the octave setting up the idyllic scene of the sea and the moon, only to be disrupted by the unsettling images of war in the sestet.

The poem forces us to consider the transience of beauty and the inevitability of death, as symbolized by the young humanity on the vessel and the newly dead in the ocean. Kilmer's use of literary devices and vivid imagery effectively conveys the emotional weight of war and its impact on individuals. Ultimately, "Mid-ocean in War-time" serves as a poignant reminder of the human cost of conflict and the fragility of life in the face of violence.
