## A Gentleman by Edward Thomas

```
"HE has robbed two clubs. The judge at Salisbury
Can't give him more than he undoubtedly
Deserves. The scoundrel! Look at his photograph!
A lady-killer! Hanging's too good by half
For such as he." So said the stranger, one
With crimes yet undiscovered or undone.
But at the inn the Gipsy dame began:
"Now he was what I call a gentleman.
He went along with Carrie, and when she
Had a baby he paid up so readily
His half a crown. Just like him. A crown'd have
   been
More like him. For I never knew him mean.
Oh! but he was such a nice gentleman. Oh!
Last time we met he said if me and Joe
Was anywhere near we must be sure and call.
He put his arms around our Amos all
As if he were his own son. I pray God
Save him from justice! Nicer man never trod."
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

The poem "A Gentleman" by Edward Thomas is written in free verse, lacking a consistent rhyme scheme or meter. This lack of formal structure allows the narrative to flow naturally, enhancing the conversational tone of the piece. The poem is divided into two distinct perspectives - that of a stranger judging the gentleman as a criminal and that of a Gipsy dame who sees him as a kind and generous individual. This division in perspectives is reflected in the structure of the poem, creating a sense of contrast and complexity in the portrayal of the gentleman.

### Themes and Imagery

The central theme of the poem revolves around the contrast between appearances and reality, as well as the subjectivity of judgment. The stranger perceives the gentleman as a criminal and a lady-killer based on his actions, while the Gipsy dame sees him as a kind and generous man. This duality in perception highlights the complexity of human nature and the limitations of judging others based solely on outward behavior. The imagery in the poem, such as the mention of the gentleman putting his arms around the Gipsy dame's son as if he were his own, conveys a sense of warmth and humanity amidst the harsh judgments of society.

### Literary Devices

One literary device used in the poem is irony, particularly in the contrasting perspectives of the stranger and the Gipsy dame. The stranger's condemnation of the gentleman as a scoundrel and a lady-killer is sharply contrasted by the Gipsy dame's affectionate portrayal of him as a kind and generous individual. This irony serves to challenge the reader's assumptions and highlight the subjective nature of judgment. Additionally, the use of dialogue in the poem adds a conversational tone, allowing the characters to express their contrasting viewpoints directly.

### Historical and Personal Context

Edward Thomas, the author of the poem, was known for his introspective and nature-focused poetry. "A Gentleman" reflects Thomas's interest in human psychology and the complexities of interpersonal relationships. The poem may also be seen as a commentary on societal norms and the tendency to judge others based on superficial appearances. Given Thomas's own struggles with personal and emotional issues, the poem could be interpreted as a reflection on the complexities of human nature and the difficulty of truly knowing someone's character.

### Deep Reading

On a deeper level, "A Gentleman" challenges the reader to question their own preconceptions and biases when it comes to judging others. The stranger's quick condemnation of the gentleman based on his criminal actions is contrasted by the Gipsy dame's more nuanced and empathetic view of him as a kind-hearted individual. This contrast serves as a reminder that people are multifaceted and cannot be reduced to simple labels or stereotypes. By presenting two conflicting perspectives on the same individual, the poem encourages the reader to consider the complexity of human nature and the limitations of snap judgments. Ultimately, "A Gentleman" invites us to look beyond outward appearances and consider the depth and complexity of each individual's character.

## 1914 V: The Soldier by Rupert Brooke

```
If I should die, think only this of me:
That there's some corner of a foreign field
That is for ever England. There shall be
In that rich earth a richer dust concealed;
A dust whom England bore, shaped, made aware,
Gave, once, her flowers to love, her ways to roam,
A body of England's, breathing English air,
Washed by the rivers, blest by suns of home.

And think, this heart, all evil shed away,
A pulse in the eternal mind, no less
Gives somewhere back the thoughts by England given;
Her sights and sounds; dreams happy as her day;
And laughter, learnt of friends; and gentleness,
In hearts at peace, under an English heaven.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme
In "1914 V: The Soldier," Rupert Brooke uses a traditional form of a sonnet, with 14 lines in iambic pentameter. The poem is divided into an octave and a sestet, with the octave presenting the idea of the soldier's physical death and burial in a foreign land, while the sestet focuses on the eternal presence of England in his thoughts. The rhyme scheme of the poem is ABBA ABBA CDCDCD, typical of a Petrarchan sonnet. Brooke's use of this form lends a sense of structure and order to the poem, reflecting the themes of patriotism and sacrifice.

### Themes and Imagery
The main themes in "1914 V: The Soldier" are patriotism, sacrifice, and the enduring connection between a soldier and his homeland. Brooke explores the idea of dying for one's country and being buried in a foreign land, yet still being forever linked to England. The imagery in the poem is rich and evocative, with the foreign field symbolizing the soldier's final resting place, and the references to England's natural beauty - the rivers, suns, flowers, and gentle English heaven - reinforcing the idea of a deep emotional connection to the homeland.

### Literary Devices
Brooke employs several literary devices in the poem, including personification, ascribing human qualities to England by describing her as giving flowers to love and having sights and sounds. Alliteration is also used, such as in "bore, shaped, made aware," to create a musical quality to the verse. Additionally, the repetition of the word "England" throughout the poem serves to emphasize the soldier's strong sense of national identity and loyalty.

### Historical and Personal Context
Written at the beginning of World War I, "1914 V: The Soldier" reflects the patriotic fervor and romanticized view of war that was prevalent at the time. Rupert Brooke himself was a well-known poet and member of the British upper class who volunteered for military service during the war. His idealized portrayal of the soldier's sacrifice and his deep connection to England resonated with many at the time who were grappling with the realities of war.

### Deep Reading
At its core, "1914 V: The Soldier" is a meditation on the enduring nature of national identity and the sacrifices made in the name of patriotism. Brooke's portrayal of the soldier as a figure who transcends physical death and lives on in the eternal mind of England speaks to the idea of collective memory and the importance of honoring those who have given their lives for their country. The poem serves as both a tribute to fallen soldiers and a reflection on the lasting impact of war on individuals and nations.
