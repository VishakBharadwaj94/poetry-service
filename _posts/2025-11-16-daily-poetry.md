## This Is No Case of Petty Right or Wrong by Edward Thomas

```
THIS is no case of petty right or wrong
That politicians or philosophers
Can judge. I hate not Germans, nor grow hot
With love of Englishmen, to please newspapers.
Beside my hate for one fat patriot
My hatred of the Kaiser is love true:--
A kind of god he is, banging a gong.
But I have not to choose between the two,
Or between justice and injustice. Dinned
With war and argument I read no more
Than in the storm smoking along the wind
Athwart the wood. Two witches' cauldrons roar.
From one the weather shall rise clear and gay;
Out of the other an England beautiful
And like her mother that died yesterday.
Little I know or care if, being dull,
I shall miss something that historians
Can rake out of the ashes when perchance
The phoenix broods serene above their ken.
But with the best and meanest Englishmen
I am one in crying, God save England, lest
We lose what never slaves and cattle blessed.
The ages made her that made us from the dust:
She is all we know and live by, and we trust
She is good and must endure, loving her so:
And as we love ourselves we hate her foe.
```

The speaker grapples with conflicting emotions towards different nations and individuals involved in the war.

These images convey the chaotic and destructive nature of war, as well as the hope for renewal and rebirth.

### Literary Devices

Thomas uses several literary devices to enhance the meaning of the poem. One notable device is paradox, as seen in the lines: "My hatred of the Kaiser is love true" and "But with the best and meanest Englishmen / I am one in crying." These paradoxes highlight the speaker's complex emotions and conflicting loyalties. Additionally, the use of personification is evident in phrases like "banging a gong" to describe the Kaiser, giving him a larger-than-life, almost godlike quality.

### Historical and Personal Context

## Summer in the South by Paul Laurence Dunbar

```
The Oriole sings in the greening grove
As if he were half-way waiting,
The rosebuds peep from their hoods of green,
Timid, and hesitating.
The rain comes down in a torrent sweep
And the nights smell warm and pinety,
The garden thrives, but the tender shoots
Are yellow-green and tiny.
Then a flash of sun on a waiting hill,
Streams laugh that erst were quiet,
The sky smiles down with a dazzling blue
And the woods run mad with riot.
```

## The Laboratory (Ancien Regime) by Robert Browning

```
Now that I, tying thy glass mask tightly,
May gaze through these faint smokes curling whitely,
As thou pliest thy trade in this devil's-smithy--
Which is the poison to poison her, prithee?

He is with her, and they know that I know
Where they are, what they do: they believe my tears flow
While they laugh, laugh at me, at me fled to the drear
Empty church, to pray God in, for them!--I am here!

Grind away, moisten and mash up thy paste,
Pound at thy powder, I am not in haste!
Better sit thus and observe thy strange things,
Than go where men wait me, and dance at the King's.

That in the mortar--you call it a gum?
Ah, the brave tree whence such gold oozings come!
And yonder soft phial, the exquisite blue,
Sure to taste sweetly,--is that poison, too?
Had I but all of them, thee and thy treasures,
What a wild crowd of Invisible pleasures!
To carry pure death in an earring, a casket,
A signet, a fan-mount, a filigree basket!

Soon, at the King's, a mere lozenge to give
And Pauline should have just thirty minutes to live!
But to light a pastille, and Elise, with her head
And her breast and her arms and her hands, should drop dead!

Quick--is it finished? The colour's too grim!
Why not soft like the phial's, enticing and dim?
Let it brighten her drink, let her turn it and stir,
And try it and taste, ere she fix and prefer!

What a drop! She's not little, no minion like me!
That's why she ensnared him: this never will free
The soul from those masculine eyes,--say "No!"
To that pulse's magnificent come-and-go.

For only last night, as they whispered, I brought
My own eyes to bear on her so that I thought
Could I keep them one half-minute fixed, she would fall
Shrivelled; she fell not: yet this does it all!

Not that I bid you spare her the pain;
Let death be felt and the proof remain:
Brand, burn up, bite into its grace--
He is sure to remember her dying face!

Is it done? Take my mask off! Nay, be not morose;
It kills her, and this prevents seeing it close:
The delicate droplet, my whole fortune's fee!
If it hurts her, beside, can it ever hurt me?

Now, take all my jewels, gorge gold to your fill,
You may kiss me, old man, on my mouth if you will!
But brush this dust off me, lest horror it brings
Ere I know it--next moment I dance at the King's!
```

The contrast between the beauty of the gold tree and the deadly nature of the poisons reflects the duality of the speaker's intentions.

### Historical and Personal Context

Robert Browning wrote "The Laboratory" during the Victorian era, a period known for its strict social conventions and moral values.

The ending of the poem, where the speaker eagerly anticipates dancing at the King's court after committing a heinous act, highlights the disconnect between outward appearances and inner turmoil.

This juxtaposition adds layers of complexity to the poem, inviting readers to question the true nature of the speaker's character and motivations.

Overall, "The Laboratory" is a powerful and evocative exploration of the darker aspects of human nature, blending vivid imagery, intricate symbolism, and psychological depth to create a haunting portrait of obsession and revenge.

*Prompt: Write a rondeau about the bittersweet nostalgia of revisiting a childhood home after many years. Explore the sensory details of sights, smells, and sounds that bring back memories, both joyful and melancholic.*

### Word Suggestions

Consider these word pairs that complement your poem's tone:

- **lie** (Germanic) / **repose** (Latinate)
  - *The word 'lie' has a more straightforward and concrete connotation, often associated with physical position or falsehood. On the other hand, 'repose' carries a more poetic and elegant nuance, suggesting a state of rest or tranquility. In the context of revisiting a childhood home with bittersweet nostalgia, 'repose' would evoke a sense of calm and reflection, enhancing the emotional depth of the poem.*
  - **Recommended:** Use the latinate version to enhance your poem's tone

- **know** (Germanic) / **recognize** (Latinate)
  - *'Know' is commonly used in a practical sense to indicate familiarity or understanding, while 'recognize' implies a deeper level of acknowledgment or identification. In a poem exploring the complexities of memory and revisiting the past, 'recognize' carries a more profound emotional weight, suggesting a connection that goes beyond mere knowledge. Therefore, 'recognize' would better suit the tone and thematic goals of the rondeau.*
  - **Recommended:** Use the latinate version to enhance your poem's tone

- **begin** (Germanic) / **commence** (Latinate)
  - *While both 'begin' and 'commence' convey the idea of starting something, 'commence' has a more formal and deliberate tone. 'Begin' feels more casual and everyday. In the context of revisiting a childhood home after many years, 'commence' adds a sense of ceremony or significance to the act of starting anew, aligning well with the reflective and introspective mood of the poem.*
