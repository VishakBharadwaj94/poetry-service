## The Life Beyond by Rupert Brooke

```
He wakes, who never thought to wake again,
Who held the end was Death. He opens eyes
Slowly, to one long livid oozing plain
Closed down by the strange eyeless heavens. He lies;
And waits; and once in timeless sick surmise
Through the dead air heaves up an unknown hand,
Like a dry branch. No life is in that land,
Himself not lives, but is a thing that cries;
An unmeaning point upon the mud; a speck
Of moveless horror; an Immortal One
Cleansed of the world, sentient and dead; a fly
Fast-stuck in grey sweat on a corpse's neck.

I thought when love for you died, I should die.
It's dead. Alone, most strangely, I live on.
```

## The Bells by Edgar Allan Poe

```
Hear the sledges with the bells--
Silver bells!
What a world of merriment their melody foretells!
How they tinkle, tinkle, tinkle,
In their icy air of night!
While the stars, that oversprinkle
All the heavens, seem to twinkle
With a crystalline delight;
Keeping time, time, time,
In a sort of Runic rhyme,
To the tintinnabulation that so musically wells
From the bells, bells, bells, bells,
Bells, bells, bells--
From the jingling and the tinkling of the bells.

Hear the mellow wedding bells,
Golden bells!
What a world of happiness their harmony foretells!
Through the balmy air of night
How they ring out their delight!
From the molten golden-notes,
And all in tune,
What a liquid ditty floats
To the turtle-dove that listens, while she gloats
On the moon!
Oh, from out the sounding cells,
What a gush of euphony voluminously wells!
How it swells!
How it dwells
On the future! how it tells
Of the rapture that impels
To the swinging and the ringing
Of the bells, bells, bells,
Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,
Bells, bells, bells--
To the rhyming and the chiming of the bells!

Hear the loud alarum bells--
Brazen bells!
What a tale of terror now their turbulency tells!
In the startled ear of night
How they scream out their affright!
Too much horrified to speak,
They can only shriek, shriek,
Out of tune,
In a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire,
In a mad expostulation with the deaf and frantic fire
Leaping higher, higher, higher,
With a desperate desire,
And a resolute endeavor
Now--now to sit or never,
By the side of the pale-faced moon.
Oh, the bells, bells, bells!
What a tale their terror tells
Of Despair!
How they clang, and clash, and roar!
What a horror they outpour
On the bosom of the palpitating air!
Yet the ear it fully knows,
By the twanging,
And the clanging,
How the danger ebbs and flows;
Yet the ear distinctly tells,
In the jangling,
And the wrangling,
How the danger sinks and swells,
By the sinking or the swelling in the anger of the bells--
Of the bells--
Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,
Bells, bells, bells--
In the clamor and the clangor of the bells!

Hear the tolling of the bells--
Iron bells!
What a world of solemn thought their monody compels!
In the silence of the night,
How we shiver with affright
At the melancholy menace of their tone!
For every sound that floats
From the rust within their throats
   Is a groan.
And the people--ah, the people--
They that dwell up in the steeple.
    All alone,
And who tolling, tolling, tolling,
  In that muffled monotone,
Feel a glory in so rolling
  On the human heart a stone--
They are neither man nor woman--
They are neither brute nor human--
    They are Ghouls:
And their king it is who tolls;
And he rolls, rolls, rolls,
         Rolls
A pæan from the bells!
And his merry bosom swells
With the pæan of the bells!
And he dances, and he yells;
Keeping time, time, time,
In a sort of Runic rhyme,
To the pæan of the bells--
    Of the bells:
Keeping time, time, time,
In a sort of Runic rhyme,
  To the throbbing of the bells--
Of the bells, bells, bells--
  To the sobbing of the bells;
Keeping time, time, time,
  As he knells, knells, knells,
In a happy Runic rhyme,
To the rolling of the bells--
Of the bells, bells, bells--
To the tolling of the bells,
Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,
  Bells, bells, bells--
To the moaning and the groaning of the bells.
```

### Form, Structure, Meter, and Rhyme

In "The Bells" by Edgar Allan Poe, the poem consists of four stanzas, each focusing on different types of bells - silver, golden, brazen, and iron. The structure of the poem is consistent, with each stanza following a similar pattern of exploring the sound and impact of the bells. Each stanza starts with an exclamation to "Hear the..." which sets the tone for the auditory experience the reader is about to encounter. 

The meter of the poem varies throughout, reflecting the changing emotions and tones of the different types of bells being described. The rhyme scheme is also varied, with Poe using internal rhyme, alliteration, and repetition to create a musical quality that mirrors the sound of the bells themselves. For example, in the first stanza, the repetition of "tinkle, tinkle, tinkle" mirrors the sound of silver bells, enhancing the auditory imagery.

### Themes and Imagery

The poem explores themes of joy, happiness, terror, and death through the imagery of different types of bells. The silver bells in the first stanza symbolize merriment and delight, while the golden bells in the second stanza evoke happiness and harmony. The brazen bells in the third stanza convey terror and despair, and the iron bells in the final stanza represent solemnity and death.

The imagery in the poem is vivid and evocative, appealing to the senses of sight and sound. Poe uses descriptive language to paint a picture of the bells ringing in the night air, creating a sensory experience for the reader. The contrast between the different types of bells helps to convey a range of emotions and moods, from joy and celebration to fear and sorrow.

### Literary Devices

Poe employs several literary devices throughout the poem to enhance its impact. One of the most prominent devices is onomatopoeia, where words imitate the sound they describe, such as "tinkle" and "clash," adding to the auditory imagery of the bells ringing. Alliteration, assonance, and repetition are also used to create a musical quality to the poem, mimicking the sound of the bells themselves.

The use of personification is evident in the poem, particularly in the descriptions of the bells as if they have human qualities and emotions. For example, the brazen bells are described as "scream[ing] out their affright," giving them a sense of agency and fear. This personification adds to the overall tone of the poem and enhances the reader's experience.

### Historical and Personal Context

"The Bells" was written by Edgar Allan Poe in 1849, near the end of his life. Poe's personal struggles with loss, grief, and mental health are reflected in the themes of death and despair present in the poem. The poem was published posthumously and is considered one of Poe's most famous works, showcasing his mastery of language and imagery.

In the historical context of the 19th century, bells were an essential part of daily life, used to mark the time, signal events, and warn of danger. Poe's use of different types of bells in the poem reflects the various roles bells played in society and how their sound could evoke different emotions and reactions in people.

### Deep Reading

Upon closer examination, "The Bells" can be seen as a meditation on the passage of time and the inevitability of death. The progression from silver bells symbolizing joy and merriment to iron bells representing solemnity and death mirrors the stages of life from birth to death. The poem's repetitive structure and refrain of "bells, bells, bells" create a sense of inevitability and finality, echoing the tolling of funeral bells.

Additionally, the changing tones and emotions associated with each type of bell can be interpreted as a metaphor for the human experience. Just as the bells transition from joy to despair, happiness to terror, individuals may also experience a range of emotions throughout their lives. The poem's exploration of sound, emotion, and mortality invites readers to contemplate the transient nature of life and the impact of time on all living things.

## How still, how happy! by Emily Bronte

```
How still, how happy! Those are words
That once would scarce agree together;
I loved the plashing of the surge -
The changing heaven the breezy weather,

More than smooth seas and cloudless skies
And solemn, soothing, softened airs
That in the forest woke no sighs
And from the green spray shook no tears.

How still, how happy! now I feel
Where silence dwells is sweeter far
Than laughing mirth's most joyous swell
However pure its raptures are.

Come, sit down on this sunny stone:
'Tis wintry light o'er flowerless moors -
But sit - for we are all alone
And clear expand heaven's breathless shores.

I could think in the withered grass
Spring's budding wreaths we might discern;
The violet's eye might shyly flash
And young leaves shoot among the fern.

It is but thought - full many a night
The snow shall clothe those hills afar
And storms shall add a drearier blight
And winds shall wage a wilder war,

Before the lark may herald in
Fresh foliage twined with blossoms fair
And summer days again begin
Their glory - haloed crown to wear.

Yet my heart loves December's smile
As much as July's golden beam;
Then let us sit and watch the while
The blue ice curdling on the stream -
```

### Literary Devices

Bronte employs several literary devices in the poem to enhance its emotional impact and thematic depth. One such device is personification, as seen in lines such as "Where silence dwells is sweeter far" and "And storms shall add a drearier blight." By attributing human qualities to abstract concepts like silence and storms, Bronte creates a sense of intimacy and connection between the natural world and the speaker's inner emotions.

Another literary device used in the poem is imagery, which helps to create vivid mental pictures for the reader. For example, the imagery of "blue ice curdling on the stream" conjures a stark and desolate winter scene, emphasizing the speaker's contemplative mood and their acceptance of the passage of time.

### Historical and Personal Context

Emily Bronte, known for her introspective and emotive poetry, often explored themes of nature, solitude, and the human experience in her works. As a reclusive and introspective individual, Bronte's personal experiences likely influenced the themes and emotions expressed in this poem. The contrast between the speaker's past and present perspectives on happiness and stillness may reflect Bronte's own evolving views on solitude and contentment.

Additionally, the poem's exploration of the changing seasons and the passage of time may be symbolic of broader societal changes during Bronte's time. The contrast between winter and summer, cold and warmth, may represent the contrasting emotions and experiences that individuals navigate in the face of change and uncertainty.
