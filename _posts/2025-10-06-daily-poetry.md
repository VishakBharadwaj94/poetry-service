## Sonnet by Rupert Brooke

```
Not with vain tears, when we’re beyond the sun,
We’ll beat on the substantial doors, nor tread
Those dusty high-roads of the aimless dead
Plaintive for Earth; but rather turn and run
Down some close-covered by-way of the air,
Some low sweet alley between wind and wind,
Stoop under faint gleams, thread the shadows, find
Some whispering ghost-forgotten nook, and there

Spend in pure converse our eternal day;
Think each in each, immediately wise;
Learn all we lacked before; hear, know, and say
What this tumultuous body now denies;
And feel, who have laid our groping hands away;
And see, no longer blinded by our eyes.
```

## Sonnet 22 - When our two souls stand up erect and strong by Elizabeth Barrett Browning

```
When our two souls stand up erect and strong,
Face to face, silent, drawing nigh and nigher,
Until the lengthening wings break into fire
At either curved point,—what bitter wrong
Can the earth do to us, that we should not long
Be here contented? Think. In mounting higher,
The angels would press on us and aspire
To drop some golden orb of perfect song
Into our deep, dear silence. Let us stay
Rather on earth, Beloved,—where the unfit
Contrarious moods of men recoil away
And isolate pure spirits, and permit
A place to stand and love in for a day,
With darkness and the death-hour rounding it.
```

## Apology by Joyce Kilmer

```
(For Eleanor Rogers Cox)

For blows on the fort of evil
That never shows a breach,
For terrible life-long races
To a goal no foot can reach,
For reckless leaps into darkness
With hands outstretched to a star,
There is jubilation in Heaven
Where the great dead poets are.
There is joy over disappointment
And delight in hopes that were vain.
Each poet is glad there was no cure
To stop his lonely pain.
For nothing keeps a poet
In his high singing mood
Like unappeasable hunger
For unattainable food.
So fools are glad of the folly
That made them weep and sing,
And Keats is thankful for Fanny Brawne
And Drummond for his king.
They know that on flinty sorrow
And failure and desire
The steel of their souls was hammered
To bring forth the lyric fire.
Lord Byron and Shelley and Plunkett,
McDonough and Hunt and Pearse
See now why their hatred of tyrants
Was so insistently fierce.
Is Freedom only a Will-o'-the-wisp
To cheat a poet's eye?
Be it phantom or fact, it's a noble cause
In which to sing and to die!
So not for the Rainbow taken
And the magical White Bird snared
The poets sing grateful carols
In the place to which they have fared;
But for their lifetime's passion,
The quest that was fruitless and long,
They chorus their loud thanksgiving
To the thorn-crowned Master of Song.
```

## Today's Writing Challenge

**Form:** Ballad

**Structure:** The Ballad traditionally consists of four-line stanzas with a rhyme scheme of ABAB. It often tells a story with a repeating refrain.

**Rhyme Scheme:** ABAB

*Prompt: Write a ballad about a mysterious traveler who arrives in a small village, bringing both joy and sorrow to its inhabitants. Explore the themes of change, nostalgia, and the passage of time.*

### Word Suggestions

Consider these word pairs that complement your poem's tone:

- **rot** (Germanic) / **putrefy** (Latinate)
  - *The word 'rot' has a more direct and visceral connotation, implying decay and deterioration. On the other hand, 'putrefy' sounds more formal and scientific, suggesting a more detached observation of decay. In the context of the poem's mysterious and foreboding tone, 'rot' would better convey the sense of impending doom and transformation.*
  - **Recommended:** Use the germanic version to enhance your poem's tone

- **write** (Germanic) / **compose** (Latinate)
  - *While both words refer to the act of creating written work, 'write' is more everyday and practical, focusing on the physical act of putting words on paper. 'Compose', on the other hand, has a more artistic and deliberate connotation, suggesting a careful crafting of a piece of music or literature. In the context of the poem's nostalgic and mysterious tone, 'compose' would add a sense of elegance and intentionality to the traveler's impact on the village.*
  - **Recommended:** Use the latinate version to enhance your poem's tone

- **meet** (Germanic) / **encounter** (Latinate)
  - *'Meet' is a simple and straightforward word denoting coming together with someone, often casually or by chance. 'Encounter', however, has a more dramatic and potentially significant feel, as if the meeting holds deeper implications or consequences. In the context of the poem's themes of change and the passage of time, 'encounter' would heighten the emotional impact of the traveler's interactions with the villagers, suggesting a more profound effect on their lives.*
  - **Recommended:** Use the latinate version to enhance your poem's tone
