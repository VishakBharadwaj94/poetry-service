        "I know what the caged bird feels, alas!",
        "When the sun is bright on the upland slopes;",
        "When the wind stirs soft through the springing grass,",
        "And the river flows like a stream of glass;",
        "When the first bird sings and the first bud opes,",
        "And the faint perfume from its chalice steals--",
        "I know what the caged bird feels!",
        "",
        "I know why the caged bird beats his wing",
        "Till its blood is red on the cruel bars;",
        "For he must fly back to his perch and cling",
        "When he fain would be on the bough a-swing;",
        "And a pain still throbs in the old, old scars",
        "And they pulse again with a keener sting--",
        "I know why he beats his wing!",
        "",
        "I know why the caged bird sings, ah me,",
        "When his wing is bruised and his bosom sore,--",
        "When he beats his bars and he would be free;",
        "It is not a carol of joy or glee,",
        "But a prayer that he sends from his heart's deep core,",
        "But a plea, that upward to Heaven he flings--",
        "I know why the caged bird sings!"
      ],

The contrast between the freedom of the outside world and the confinement of the cage is vividly depicted through descriptions of the sun, wind, river, and springing grass. The imagery of the caged bird beating its wings and singing portrays a sense of struggle and resilience in the face of adversity.\n\n3. Literary Devices:\n- Personification: The caged bird is personified throughout the poem, giving it human-like qualities and emotions. This helps to convey the bird's sense of longing and pain.\n- Metaphor: The caged bird serves as a metaphor for oppression and the desire for freedom. The bird's physical confinement is symbolic of the emotional and psychological constraints faced by individuals.\n- Repetition: The repetition of the phrase \"I know\" emphasizes the speaker's empathy and understanding of the caged bird's experience. It also highlights the emotional depth of the poem.\n\n4. Historical and Personal Context:\nPaul Laurence Dunbar was an African American poet who often explored themes of racial inequality and oppression in his work. \"Sympathy\" can be seen as a reflection of Dunbar's own experiences as a marginalized individual in a society that limited his opportunities and freedom.

Deep Reading:\nOn a deeper level, \"Sympathy\" can be interpreted as a powerful critique of the societal structures that oppress and confine individuals. The caged bird symbolizes marginalized groups who are denied their basic rights and freedoms. The poem conveys a sense of empathy and solidarity with those who are suffering and struggling for liberation. By giving voice to the caged bird's silent plea for freedom, Dunbar highlights the importance of empathy, compassion, and understanding in the face of injustice. Ultimately, \"Sympathy\" serves as a poignant reminder of the resilience and spirit of those who continue to fight for their rights and dignity."
