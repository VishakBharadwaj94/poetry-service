# Germanic and Latinate Word Pairs

## On the Richness of English

Jorge Luis Borges, in his Charles Eliot Norton Lectures at Harvard, celebrated English as a language of remarkable depth and flexibility. He praised how English uniquely draws from two great linguistic traditions - the earthy, direct Germanic heritage of Anglo-Saxon and the abstract, formal elegance of Latin through Norman French.

This duality, Borges observed, gives English writers an extraordinary palette. Where other languages might have one word, English offers two registers: the immediate, visceral Germanic form alongside its more intellectual, refined Latinate counterpart. A writer can choose between "house" and "domicile," between "brotherly" and "fraternal," between "begin" and "commence" - each choice carrying its own weight, tone, and connotation.

This linguistic richness, born from conquest and cultural fusion, makes English uniquely suited for poetry and prose. The Germanic words feel ancient and instinctive; the Latinate words carry sophistication and precision. Together, they create a language of unparalleled expressive range.
